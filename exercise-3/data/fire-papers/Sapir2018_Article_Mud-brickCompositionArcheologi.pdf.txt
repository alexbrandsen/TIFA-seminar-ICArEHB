Abstract The eighth century BCE city at Tel ‘Eton (Israel)
was destroyed by the Assyrian army, probably during
Sennacherib’s campaign of 701. Building 101, sealed within
the heavy conflagration caused by this destruction, was uncovered almost in its entirety on the top of the mound. From
the beginning, it was apparent that the structure had two major
building phases, and while its initial construction was of high
quality, later additions were much inferior. Analyses of mudbrick walls for firing temperatures, texture, carbonate content,
color, and dimensions approved the observation regarding the
differences between the two phases, but consistently pointed
out that one wall, initially attributed to the first phase, was
analytically different, comprising an intermediate phase.
This conclusion not only altered our understanding of the
building construction, adding heretofore unknown building
phase, but also gave us insights into the pre-planning of
Building 101, indicating that some rooms had originally two
doorways. Such a configuration allowed easy subdivision of
spaces according to needs, without harming the overall structural stability. Differences in inner division of similar Iron Age
houses were identified in the past and were attributed to differences in the life cycles of families. The evidence from Tel
‘Eton suggests that such future changes were taken into considerations when the structures were built.

Introduction
Architecture, and especially domestic architecture, is a major
field of inquiry within archeology (e.g., Kempinski and Reich
1992; Lawrence and Low 1990; Parker Pearson and Richards
1994; Wright 1985), and building materials and technology
also had their share of scholarly attention (e.g., Adam 2005;
Nicholson and Shaw 2000; Wright 2000). The discovery of
well-preserved Iron Age II architectural remains at Tel ‘Eton,
Israel, enabled us to conduct a detailed study of various aspects of those buildings, their construction, and destruction;
special attention has been devoted to building materials, including mud-bricks, which were used for the construction of
the houses. The mud-bricks were subsequently studied as to
their texture (grain size distribution), size, firing temperatures,
carbonate content, color, and more. Surprisingly, this
Btechnical^ study, and the analytical examination of the material, altered our understanding of the relative dating of the
constructional phases of the building, and even gave us insights into the cognition of the planners and the pre-planning
of one of the buildings, and by extension to that of Iron Age
houses at large.
Tel ‘Eton
Tel ‘Eton is a large mound in the southeastern Shephelah
(lowlands), Israel, about 11 km southeast of Tel Lachish, near
the trough valley that separates the lowlands from the Hebron
highlands (Fig. 1). The site, which is commonly identified
with the biblical city of Eglon (Joshua 10:34–36, 12:12,
15:39), is located near a major road junction, where the
north-south road that meandered along the trough valley met
the east-west road that passed along Nahal Adoraim (the
brook of Adoraim) and connected Lachish and Hebron, and
in proximity to good agricultural land. Brief salvage

excavations were conducted at the site in the 1970s by the
Lachish Expedition (Ayalon 1985; Zimhoni 1985), exposing
two Iron Age II strata. Since 2006, the site has been excavated
by a Bar-Ilan University expedition. The results indicate that
the mound was settled during the Early Bronze Age, and from
the Late Bronze Age to the early Hellenistic period (with a gap
during the seventh-fifth centuries BCE). The main period of
settlement encountered so far is that of the eighth century BCE
(Iron Age IIB), when a large, fortified Judahite town thrived
on the mound (Faust 2011, 2014; Faust and Katz 2015). This
city was violently destroyed toward the end of this century.
The destruction sealed the houses and their content within a
massive destruction layer, preserving the remains in an excellent condition. The rich ceramic assemblage unearthed,
along with the relevant historical documents, suggests
that the city was most likely destroyed during the

campaign of the Assyrian king, Sennacherib, in
701 BCE (Faust 2011, 2014; Faust and Katz 2015;
Katz and Faust 2012; for a detailed discussion of the
campaign, with many references, see Faust 2008).
Building 101
Near the southern edge of the mound, on its highest part, we
uncovered parts of a few eighth century BCE buildings. The
largest of those was Building 101 (Fig. 2). This is a large fourroom house (see explanation below), whose estimated ground
floor area is about 230–240 m2 (most urban Iron Age dwellings in the region were in the scale of 40–70 m2, and the larger
ones tended to be in the scale of 120 m2, exemplifying the
relative large size of the discussed building). Massive work
preceded the construction of the building, and in the few

Fig. 2 Building 101. The lower courses of walls F1020/F1162, F1231,
F1385, and F1029, from phase 1, are made of stone. Wall F1048 was
estimated to be of the same phase, though it lacks stone courses. Walls
F1031, F1032/F1041, and F1315 are thinner walls from the structure’s
later stage (phase 2). Wall F1173 was included in phase 2 because it used

similar mud-bricks and is clearly later than the original construction, but it
lacks clear association with phase 2 walls. The sample locations with
representation of the FTIR analysis results are presented on the plan.

places where we penetrated below the floors, we uncovered
evidence of massive preparation work, sometimes reaching
1 m deep; even below the courtyard, chalk plates were positioned below the floor. The use of continuous foundations,
massive walls, ashlar stones in corners and doorways, along
with the quality of the mud-bricks (to be discussed below) are
also quite impressive, and are extraordinary when compared
with other Iron Age II buildings at Tel ‘Eton and in other sites.
The distribution of the finds and the evidence for second story
floors that were unearthed in most of the rooms suggest that an
upper story was built over part of the structure (Faust 2011;
Faust and Katz 2015). The structure is located in the highest
point of the mound and controlled most of the city and much
of its surroundings, including the fields in the valleys around
the mound, and segments of the roads that passed nearby. The
finds within the building include dozens of storage vessels,
and additional evidence for the storage of food surpluses,
along with a small collection of bullae, sealings, and a seal,
attesting some administrative activity. Thus, the size of the

building and its location, along with the quality of the construction and the finds unearthed in it, led us to label it as the
Bgovernor’s residency^ (Faust 2011; Faust and Katz 2015).
The building does not only belong to the group of elite Iron
Age buildings, but is actually part of the upper echelon of this
group (for comparative data and the discussion of wealth in
the Iron Age, see Faust 2012, and many references). Many of
the inner walls were built of mud-brick courses on top of stone
courses, but it is possible that the outer walls were built of
stone only, as we never found mud-bricks on top of the stone
courses in these walls. In the late eighth century BCE, probably during Sennacherib’s 701 BCE campaign, the building
was destroyed in a conflagration, as evidenced by the charred
botanic remains that was accompanied by dozens arrowheads
that were unearthed within the debris. The preservation was
excellent—some of the walls were preserved to a height of
about 1.5 m. Although the building experienced some changes
during the course of its life, its plan did not change drastically
and the outer walls were not altered.

Building 101 was a large four-room house. This term refers
to a typical Iron Age building whose idealized plan is that of a
long structure which is divided into three longitudinal spaces
(with the entrance located in the central one) and a broad space
at the back, perpendicular to the longitudinal spaces (there are
many subgroups within this genre; Bunimovitz and Faust
2002; Faust and Bunimovitz 2003, 2014; Holladay 1997;
Netzer 1992; Shiloh 1970). In most excavated four-room
houses, the various spaces (usually with the exception of the
central longitudinal room) are subdivided, and those buildings
typically contain more than four rooms (hence, four areas, or
four spaces, would be a more appropriate term; still, for the
sake of consistency and clarity, we prefer to use the common
convention). The entrance to Building 101 was from the east,
and the central room was originally (phase 1, Fig. 2) a large
open (unroofed) courtyard (room 101A, subdivided in phase 2
into rooms 101A1-3). The longitudinal northern and southern
spaces were, however, subdivided into smaller rooms. In
phase 1, we identified rooms 101D, 101E, 101F, and 101G
in the northern space, rooms 101I and 101J in the southern
space, and rooms 101B and 101C at the back. The construction of the building in this phase is characterized by high
quality and great investment, reflected by large ashlar stones
in some of the corners of the building, and thick and massive
stone walls, the inner of which were topped by mud-bricks, as
well as the massive preparation that preceded the construction
of the building, the continuous foundations that were used,
and more. Only one inner wall, F1048 (between rooms
101D and 101E) was built of mud-bricks without stone
courses. The wall was also thinner, and its lowest course appears to be different in its color and quality. This constructional difference was explained by its being located under a roof
and therefore protected from weathering effects.
Notably, by the time of the destruction of the building (phase 2, Fig. 2), the inner courtyard (the central
longitudinal space) was divided into three spaces
(101A1-3) by thinner mud-brick walls, which were
clearly not part of the original construction; they were
built on top of the original floor, they obstructed movement within the building and were built in a completely
different manner (see also Faust 2011, 2014; Faust and
Katz 2015). Although they were exposed to the elements, they were built of weak mud-bricks. Few of
the other walls were also suspected as being later
changes, or at least had the potential to be so (e.g.,
F1173—a mud-brick wall on-top of the phase 1 stone
wall F1171), but their phasing could not be determined
with certainty.
The study of the mud-bricks, however, unintentionally
sharpened our understanding of the various construction
phases, and enabled us to better identify the various stages
of the building, and even gave us some insights into the preplanning of this large structure.

Mud-bricks in Tel ‘Eton
Many of the mud-bricks of Building 101 were examined as to
their dimensions, texture (granulometry), carbonate content,
color, and firing temperatures.
Dimensions The dimensions of the mud-bricks in Building
101 were taken, where possible, from in situ mud-bricks (all
mud-bricks that could be measured for their length, width, and
height were measured). Measurements were taken using a
millimetric measuring tape. The results (Table 1) are generally
consistent with the above division into two phases. All the
mud-bricks of the phase 1 walls are quite similar in size, in
contrast to the mud-bricks of the phase 2 walls (below). Still,
the mud-bricks from wall F1048 are generally higher than the
mud-bricks from the other phase 1 walls. The mud-bricks
from phase 2 were composed of very loose and fragile material and, due to the poor preservation (before and after their
exposure), their contours could not usually be identified. Only
rarely did we manage (partially) to identify contours of mudbricks in those walls, but the bricks were usually broken or
incomplete. The height (but not the width and length) of two
of these mud-bricks could be measured and is 15 cm, which is

Mud-brick courses are numbered from the lowest one. For wall locations,
see Fig. 2 (note that sampling points on the plan relate to samples taken
for analyzing temperatures, texture, carbonate content, and color, and not
to the bricks examined for size). All mud-bricks which could be accurately measured were examined, and where no clear measurement could be
taken, a question mark is noted. No measurements from typical phase 2
mud-bricks were taken due to the technical difficulties mentioned in the
text, but two of the heated phase 2 mud-bricks were measured for their
heights (see discussion in the text)

Fig. 3 FTIR analysis results of a control sample from the surrounding
soil that was heated in oven to high temperatures. The plots show the
changes that occur at the different temperatures and are detectable starting

from between 400-500 °C. Note, for example, how the small peaks at
430, 519, 915, 3622, and 3696 cm−1 are becoming vague (shoulder
instead of peaks) at 500 °C and disappear at 600 °C

slightly higher than the typical phase 1 mud-bricks, and lower
than most of those of wall F1048 mud-bricks. Given the small
number of phase 2 mud-bricks whose height could be determined, however, it is difficult to assess the significance of this
observation. As we will see below, those appear to be older
mud-bricks that were originally used elsewhere and were
reused in the construction of the phase 2 walls. The finding
of those mud-bricks rules out the possibility that the phase 2
walls were made solely of puddled earth (terre pisé) or related
technologies, since in this case, no single mud-bricks were
supposed to be found. These bricks were sampled, of course,
but since they are exceptional, they cannot represent the type
of bricks used in phase 2 (more details below).
For the other analyses, at least three mud-bricks were sampled from every available mud-brick wall of Building 101.
The samples were chosen randomly, and only the outer 1–
2 cm were taken from each sampled mud-brick. The samples
came from different mud-bricks and different courses whenever possible (see Fig. 2 for sample locations).

control samples (Fig. 3). The results (Table 2, Fig. 2) showed
homogeneity in phase 1 and heterogeneity in phase 2. All the
mud-bricks from phase 1 were exposed to temperatures of
above 400 °C, while most of the phase 2 bricks showed no
firing signs. Wall F1048 is similar in this parameter to phase 1,
with the caveat that all the sampled bricks from the upper
courses were fired to 400–500 °C, while most of the bricks
from phase 1 were heated to above 500 °C (the mud-bricks of
the lowest course were all unfired). The question whether the
firing was intentional or simply a result of the conflagration
during the destruction is intriguing but is beyond the scope of
this article and will be discussed at length elsewhere. In the
present context, we can only state that the evidence strongly
suggests that firing was intentional.

Firing temperatures Previous studies showed that sediments
that were heated to above 400 °C can be identified using FTIR
analysis (Berna et al. 2007; Forget et al. 2015; Friesem et al.
2014). We used the same method, including the preparation of

Texture analysis (commonly referred to as granulometry
or grain size distribution analysis) This is a well-established
method in geology and pedology. It may be used to perform
intra- and inter-site comparison of mud-bricks and to follow
the changes of the construction techniques through time, as
reflected by the variation in the selection of the source material—the proportions of the sediments fractions (namely sand,
silt, and clay) in the mud-bricks. Moreover, the variation in the
sediments fractions of the bricks may influence their quality

342

and durability (Fathy 1973; Homsher 2012; Kemp 2000; Love
2012; Rosen 1986: chap. 5; Wright 1985: 106–107). One of
the sources to the soils and the sediments in the area are calcareous rocks, and therefore calcite might constitute a major
portion of soils and sediments. Therefore, in order to study the
complete composition of the sediments, we did not remove the
carbonates from the samples. Grain size distribution was determined by the sedimentation method (Baver 1956: 59;
Wright 1939).1 Each sample was sifted through 2 mm mesh
(minimal grinding).2 About 5–6 g were taken from each sample for this analysis. The sediments were first dispersed with
0.5 % Na2CO3 solution and separated into three grain size
fractions by multi-decantation from 0.05 % Na2CO3 solution:
clay (<2 μm), silt (2–50 μm), and sand (50–2000 μm).
The results (Table 2, Fig. 4) show that the phase 1 mudbricks are homogeneous in texture, with the exception of the
samples from wall F1048. As noted above, in most cases, we
could not identify the contour of the bricks in the walls of
phase 2 and most of the samples were taken from these undistinguished mud-bricks. Generally speaking, the mud-bricks of
the phase 2 walls are much richer in clay compared to those of
phase 1. The exceptions are samples MB15 and MB27–29
(Table 2), which were taken from the few mud-bricks which
were fired and whose contours had been identified. Those
bricks, which survived after years of exposure (following their
discovery in the first seasons of excavations) are very different
(both visually and analytically) from the typical mud-bricks in
the walls in which they were embedded. These differences in
the characteristics are ascribed to their firing and might reflect
mud-bricks that were fired and used in other walls, and reused
when the walls of phase 2 were built (below).
It is quite clear that there is correlation between the firing
temperatures and the sediment texture presented above, and
that the firing changes the texture (Ketterings and Bigham
2000; Terefe et al. 2008; Ulery and Graham 1993). Still, we
must stress that the FTIR analysis is insufficient to make the
texture analysis obsolete, since FTIR analysis alone would not
have enabled us to confidently distinguish F1048 from other
phase 1 walls. The upper courses of F1048 were all fired to a
temperature of 400–500 °C, like many of the mud-bricks in
phase 1 walls, but the texture of the sediments differed, enabling us to identify the bricks as belonging to a different
group. The same clearly applies to the lowest, unfired (and
hence unchanged) course of F1048, and the granulometry

1
While other methods are commonly used (pipette method or hydrometer method), the advantage of the method used here is its accuracy. Its
main shortcoming is that it is time-consuming due to the sedimentation
time and the number of decantation cycles (it took us 3–4 weeks for sets
of 20 samples).
2
We should note that in all the material that was sifted out from the
samples, we did not find pottery sherds or other artifacts, and only a
few small stones were identified.

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2018) 10:337–350

results distinguished it from all other groups, including the
unfired bricks of phase 2.
Carbonate content This analysis measures the percentage of
the carbonates in the material, which influences the aggregation (Zwikel 2004; see also Stavi et al. 2008). Unlike grain
distribution analysis, however, carbonate content is not influenced by firing below 1000 °C (Certini 2005: 4), and hence,
observed differences are results of source material (see also
Love 2012). The analysis was done in a calcimeter, according
to the procedure outlined by Shaharabani (1985; see also
Loeppert and Suarez 1996). We used the same samples that
were taken for the texture analysis, adding samples from the
vicinity of Tel ‘Eton for control.3 The results (Table 2, Fig. 5)
in samples taken from walls which are clearly from phase 1
(F1020/F1162, F1029, F1231, and F1385) are homogeneous
(total average of 12.4 ± 3.34 %) and lower than in samples
from the environment. This would not mean that the mud was
imported, only that we did not sample the exact location of the
mud quarrying, since the value that we found in one locus is
just slightly higher than the mud-bricks of phase 1. Wall
F1048 which was built in a different manner than the other
walls of phase 1 is different also in the carbonate content,
which is significantly higher (arcsin transformation,
p < 0.001, total average of 27.3 ± 2.02 % for wall F1048),
strengthening the view that this wall was built as part of a
different phase. The phase 2 walls are more varied in their
carbonate content (total average of 23.8 ± 12.07 %)—wall
F1032/F1041 has a wide range, generally higher than phase
1 walls and similar to the samples from the environment,
while walls F1031 and F1173 are similar to phase 1 walls in
this regard. There is no significant difference between wall
F1048 to phase 2 walls in carbonate content, probably due
to the small number of samples.
We cannot tell whether the carbonates are the cause
for the different texture of wall F1048. The differences
might be a result of other initial mechanical composition, such as the initial size fractions or the amount of
the organic content before the firing, but at any event,
this would point at different mud composition or different preparation method, supporting the notion that this
wall was indeed different.
Color The color of sediments may be influenced by
many parameters, such as texture, aggregation, organic
matter, carbonate content, and chemical composition.
For example, the Hue of samples becomes redder as a
consequence of heating to high temperatures, and organic matter darkens the Value (Forget et al. 2015;

Wall F1048 was included in phase 1 but with a question mark due to its different construction method. Wall F1173 was included in phase 2 but with a
question mark due to lack of phasing evidences. MB34 and MB36 are samples from the mud coating of wall F1385, but generally speaking, they are in
line with the mud-bricks of the same wall

Ketterings and Bigham 2000; Pomies et al. 1998;
Sánchez-Marañón et al. 2004; Ulery and Graham
1993). Color was examined by standard Munsell color
charts for air-dried fine earth (2 mm sieved) samples.
The results (Table 2, Fig. 6) show that the range of

phase 1 samples is generally narrower than phase 2,
and that phase 1 walls contain mainly samples with
Hue of 7.5YR (along with two redder samples, Hue of
5YR). The walls of phase 2 reveal not only general
variability but also intra-wall variability. Wall F1048 is

Fig. 4 a Sediments texture triangular diagram for the mud-brick samples
collected from Building 101 walls. The sediments were separated into
three grain size fractions: clay (<2 μm), silt (2–50 μm), and sand (50–
2000 μm). The samples from phase 1 are homogeneous, and the samples
from phase 2 are heterogeneous (some of phase 2 samples are inside the
range of samples from phase 1). Wall F1048 had one range for its upper

courses, and second range for its lowest course. Plotting was done
according to Graham and Midgley (2000) software. b The averages and
the standard errors of the phases show the differences of the fractions and
their variability between the groups. F1048 is divided to upper courses
and lowest course

highly homogeneous with identical colors, and only one
sample differs with lower Chroma.

When the results were examined and plotted on the plan of
Building 101, a very clear pattern appeared, which only partially conformed to the way we initially perceived the constructional phases. While the distinction between phases 1
and 2 clearly holds, and is now supported by the analytical

data regarding the size of the bricks (or even the mere ability
to identify them), their firing temperatures, texture, carbonate
content and color, it appears that there was an additional group
of mud-bricks—that of F1048. Those apparently composed an
intermediate phase, hence changing the way we understand
the construction phases of the building. We can now suggest
new constructional phases for Building 101 (Fig. 7):
Phase 1.1, which is the equivalent to most of the walls of
our previous phase 1 (above), includes mud-bricks on stone
walls F1020/F1162, F1029, F1231, and F1385. This phase is
characterized by bricks with heights of 12–15 cm, very low

Fig. 5 a Carbonate content averages per wall (error bars represent one
standard deviation). The number of samples per wall is as follows: F1020/
F1162, n = 7; F1029 n = 3; F1231, n = 3; F1385, n = 5 (two samples from the
mud coating); F1048, n = 3 for upper courses and n = 3 for lowest course;

F1031, n = 3; F1031/F1041, n = 9; F1173, n = 3; environment n = 7. b The
average of the phases shows two statistical groups (a and b inside the bars).
Wall F1048 is not significantly distinguished from phase 2, but it has much
narrower range (error bars represent one standard error)

Fig. 6 Munsell color parameters range for the mud-bricks. Hue, in YR
scale (reddening of sediments means decrease in YR), Value, and
Chroma. Note that for all the color parameters, phase 1 range (n = 18)

is narrow compared to phase 2 (n = 15), and wall F1048 has a very tight
range for both the lowest (n = 3) and the upper (n = 3) courses, and it
differ from phase 1 in one of the Chroma results

clay, medium silt, and high sand fractions (2.4, 28.0, and
69.6 % in average, respectively), firing temperatures of above
400 °C (and mostly above 500 °C), low carbonate content
(12.4 % in average), and tight color range. Not only are the
samples different from these of the other phases, but they also
form a homogenous and close-fitting group.
It appears, however, that F1048, which we initially considered as part of phase 1 (now phase 1.1) does not belong to this
phase. The prevalent bricks of this wall (with the exception of
the lowest course, see below) are also homogeneous but (1) the
bricks of wall F1048 are different in size (higher, 15–19 cm)
than those of phase 1.1 walls (typically 12–14 cm, with one
mud-brick which reaches 15 cm). This implies that different
brick-makers using different molds prepared the mud-bricks of
this wall; (2) with a slightly higher clay, higher silt and lower
sand fractions (7.2, 43.4, and 49.4 % in average, respectively) in
comparison to the walls from phase 1.1; (3) the firing temperatures show generally lower temperature than most of phase 1.1
bricks, yet they were all heated to above 400 °C, which is not
typical of phase 2 bricks. The mud-bricks of the lowest course of
F1048 are exceptional with a different texture and no firing
signs, perhaps due to constructional considerations; (4) the carbonate content of the bricks in this wall is significantly higher
than in those of phase 1.1 (yet homogeneous, unlike phase 2);
and (5) the colors of this wall (both the lowest course and upper
courses) are highly homogeneous. The analytical differences in
texture, height, carbonate content, color, and even firing temperature, along with the lack of stone courses below the mud-bricks
of wall F1048 and the existence of an unfired mud-brick course
at its base, are all suggesting that wall F1048 was not part of the
same phase. Although we do not have any deposits that can be
used to directly date the two phases, the mere fact that wall
F1048 is abutting F1020 from phase 1.1 (and as we learned,
they are not contemporaneous) suggests that F1048 must be
later than it; hence, it postdates phase 1.1. We should add that
unlike most of the walls of phase 1.1, wall F1048 has no constructive importance, and hence is more likely to be later than
the other phase 1.1 walls. However, the overall similarity between F1048 and the phase 1.1 walls, when compared with the
stark differences between it and the walls of phase 2 (and

additional evidence for the latters’ late date, see discussion below) suggests that wall F1048 is closer in time to phase 1.1, and
earlier than phase 2. We, therefore, attribute F1048 to an intermediate phase—heretofore labeled phase 1.2.
Phase 2 includes walls F1031, F1032/F1041, and probably
also F1173. This phase is characterized by unfired bricks (i.e.,
if they were heated, it was to temperatures below 400 °C) with
much higher clay fractions (34.9 % in average) compared to
phase 1.1 and the typical mud-bricks of phase 1.2. A few
uncharacteristic bricks, which are very similar to the phase
1.1 walls in texture and firing temperatures (MB15, MB27–
29), were unearthed in walls’ corners or in joining points.
These bricks were probably taken from other walls and reused
(see below). The carbonate content is varied in this
phase: in two walls (F1173, F1031), the results are
low and similar to phase 1.1, while in the other wall
(F1032/F1041), the values are varied and similar to the
environment. Since the carbonate content is not affected
by the firing (as opposed to the texture) and relates to
the parent material, these mud-bricks were clearly taken
from different mud quarries. The colors of phase 2
walls are also heterogeneous, even within the same
walls. Not surprisingly, phase 1.1 and phase 2 are
clearly distinct. The inter-wall differences within phase
2 might imply either different construction stages (occurring within a short time) or different construction
teams that quarried the mud from different places, but
since this phase is heterogeneous, we cannot define
subphasing here.
As noted, within phase 2 walls, some mud-bricks which
were different from the rest of the mud-bricks of the very same
walls were identified (MB15, MB27–29). The exact dimensions of the mud-bricks could not have been determined, but
as noted above, the height of two of them was 15 cm, i.e.,
more than the typical phase 1.1 mud-bricks (but less than the
typical phase 1.2 mud-bricks). Since only two mud-bricks
were measured, however, it is not clear how significant this
difference is. Due to their carbonate content, these heated and
low-clay bricks cannot be attributed as a group to neither
phase 1.1 nor phase 1.2, and they also do not form a single

Fig. 7 Schematic plans,
illustrating the phases of Building
101, as revealed in this study (cf.
Fig. 2). In phase 1.1, both rooms
101D-E and 101I had two doorways, and in phase 1.2, wall F1048
divided room 101D-E into two
rooms whereas room 101I
remained undivided. In phase 2,
the internal yard is divided by walls
of lower quality and F1173 was
built as a renovation to wall F1171

homogeneous group. This variability, along with the fact that
those mud-bricks were fired, suggests that they were taken
from some dismantled walls from another building and were
reused, or were prepared in the same manner as in phase 1.1
but with the mud quarried from different places (one of them

with high carbonate content). The locations of these mudbricks within the phase 2 walls seem to be intentional, and
it is likely that due to their strength, they were placed in
hazardous constructional points within these walls, e.g., in
corners (as in F1032, MB27–29) or in joints with phase

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2018) 10:337–350

1.1 walls (as in F1031, MB15) in order to strengthen them
(initial results, from wall F1020, suggest that the fired
bricks had a considerable level of bearing capacity—peak
strength 3.05 MPa).

Constructional phases and pre-planning in Building
101
The understanding that wall F1048 is not part of the original
plan (phase 1.1) paves the way to a new understanding of the
planning of Building 101. Thus, in the first phase, the western
part of both the northern and the southern wings was composed
of a large space in each wing, with two doorways leading into
each space (Fig. 7, phase 1.1; cf., Fig. 2). It appears that the
rooms were intentionally built that way. The purpose of this may
have been to enable further subdivision of each space into two
smaller rooms, without the need to dismantle walls and endanger the structural integrity of the building. Differences in the
inner division of structures, despite overall outer similarity, is a
well-known phenomenon in the Iron Age (cf., Albright 19411943: pl. 6; Chambon 1984; Fig. 3; Dar 1986: 20; see also Faust
2012: 161–162), and was explained as resulting from changes in
the life cycle of extended families, or in the function of the
buildings (e.g., Faust 1999, 2000, 2012; cf., Moore 1986;
Seymour-Smith 1994: 76; Wilk and Rathje 1982: 626).
Indeed, at some later point (phase 1.2), the large room in
the north wing was subdivided by a wall (F1048), creating two
smaller rooms (101D and 101E), each with its own doorway.
Apparently, in the southern room (room 101I), there was no
need to create such a division, and hence, it remains a large
room, with two doorways leading into one space (or, perhaps,
it has been divided, and the dividing wall was later dismantled, recreating the large room). The construction of F1048
was later than the original construction of the building, and
this may explain why it was made with mud-bricks of different sizes (slightly higher), from a different source of materials
(different carbonate content and texture range), fired in lower
temperatures than most of phase 1.1 bricks and built using a
different construction method (without stone courses below
the mud-brick courses and with a lowest course of unfired
mud-bricks). Still, judging by the homogeneity of the material
and the overall similarity to the mud-bricks of phase 1.1, it
appears that this change was done at a relatively early stage
and as part of the changes in the use of space within the house,
or in other words, as part of its life cycle.
Phase 2 is characterized by using materials of a less uniform quality which were less carefully selected. While this
observation was made already during the excavations and on
the basis of the architecture, it is now clearly supported by
analytical examinations. There may be various reasons for
the differences of the building materials used and to the suggested reuse of older mud-bricks. In theory, such differences

347

could result from the participation of a large group (Nodarou
et al. 2008: 3014), or multiple groups of peoples (GoodmanElgar et al. 2015: 51), in the erection of the building, each with
its own building tradition, and each might have used a different source for the mud-bricks. This, however, does not seem to
account for the phenomenon observed, since if such differences are to be found, they are more likely to be found when
the building was constructed, and not in what is evidently its
final phase. All the walls that belong to the first phase, by
contrast, are uniform in all measured parameters, indicating
that such a tradition (in which many disparate groups participate in the construction of houses) was not practiced here.
Only in the last phase of the building, apparently on the eve
of its destruction (Katz and Faust 2012) when construction
was under pressure of time, do we find variability in the source
material or the quality of construction. The new walls apparently represent final changes and adjustments that were done
as part of the preparation for the impending Assyrian campaign (such changes are often expressed in domestic architecture of elite buildings; cf. Hazor, where two new impressive
dwellings built near the fort were interpreted as the houses of
officials built during the reorganization of the city’s defenses;
Geva 1989: 41; Yadin 1972: 187–189). In Building 101, it
seems that the modifications created a separation between
the private and the public parts of the house, allowing people
to enter the storage spaces within the house, while limiting the
exposure of the private rooms. In light of the ceramic assemblage unearthed and the violent destruction of the building, we
suggest that it is most likely that this phase should be dated to
immediately before the destruction of the site in 701 BCE
(Katz and Faust 2012). The construction, therefore, was done
under pressure of time, and perhaps even with limited accessibility to quality building materials (if this was done when the
Assyrian army already controlled the area), leading to the use
of heterogeneous construction materials, which were partially
taken from dismantled walls. That the mud-bricks were older
ones, and were now only reused, is supported by the fact that
although these mud-bricks were clearly identified within the
nonfired mud-brick walls of phase 2, not a single mud-brick
could be measured for its length and width (above). This suggests that the mud-bricks were damaged when scavenged
from earlier walls (mud-bricks, unlike stones, are not typically
reused in later construction). Although we cannot completely
rule out the option that some of the older mud-bricks were
reused in order to save and reduce expenses, we find it less
reasonable, as the finds within the structure clearly indicate
that when it was destroyed the house still served as an edifice
(as is reflected in the surpluses unearthed in the building, and
by the bullae, the sealings, and the seal unearthed in it; Faust
2011, 2014; Faust and Eshel 2012; Faust and Katz 2015).
Thus, although the building still filled an important capacity,
the siege or the impending siege led to the addition of lower
quality walls in the courtyard, and to the change in its use of

348

space. It appears that this is also the time when F1173 was
built as a renovation of wall F1171.

Conclusions
The analytical examination of the mud-bricks from Tel ‘Eton
significantly improved our understanding of the construction at
the site, and even allowed us some insights into the understanding of mud-brick construction in general. Thus, for example,
high-quality walls are texturally composed of very low clay
and high sand fractions (due to firing). This settles well with
studies about preferred mechanical composition for mud-bricks
(e.g., Brown and Clifton 1978; Emery 2011; Goldberg 1979;
Kemp 2000). The desired carbonate content, according to our
results, seems to be low, in order to get high-quality bricks,
which settles well with the conclusions of Zwikel (2004: 151–
152) which showed that low carbonate content contribute to the
stability of the aggregates (see also Stavi et al. 2008). However,
in addition to the technical aspects of mud-brick construction
(which will be discussed elsewhere), we would like to present
two significant conclusions which in our view have implications
that go beyond the study of Tel ‘Eton:
1. While not necessarily a universal feature, there are cases in
which there is uniformity in the mud-bricks that are constructed at any given moment\building\site. Mud-bricks
used in the same phase might be prepared together and
hence similar in many ways. Still, in the course of time,
there are many changes in the way the mud-bricks are prepared, and hence different phases can be distinguished visually (color and dimensions) and analytically. This is welldocumented in many examples in which different brickmakers used different molds (e.g., Homsher 2012: 10;
Nafsika et al. 2014: 18). While the mud-brick analysis confirmed our basic observation regarding the differences between the first phase (high quality and homogenous group)
and the second phase (poorer quality and heterogeneous), it
also allowed us to date wall F1048, originally attributed to
the first phase, to a different intermediary stage, thus altering
our understanding of the history of the building.
We therefore conclude that even if there could be differences in the quality of bricks that are made at the same time
(Kemp 2000: 84–88), there are probably always differences
over time. Hence, if uniformity within phases of construction
can be identified, then diversity between groups of bricks
might be indicative of temporal differences. This can be tested, and if proved correct, can be also applied in other
excavations.
2. Understanding F1048 as an added wall from a different phase
allowed us to understand why some rooms (101I and 101DE) had originally two doorways. Apparently, Building 101
was pre-planned to enable flexibility in its use, and some

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2018) 10:337–350

spaces were built in a way that allowed simple sub-division
(and even re-division), according to circumstances.
Differences in inner division of four-room houses, despite
great similarity in the overall plan, were identified in many
cases in the past, and were attributed to the differences in the
life cycle of families (Faust 1999, 2000, 2012). The evidence
from Tel‘Etonsuggeststhatsuchexpectedchanges(resulting
from the life cycle of the family, along with additional possible reasons) were a factor that was taken into consideration
when structures were built, and the construction was planned
in a way that allowed much future flexibility and changes,
without harming the overall stability of the houses and their
structural integrity.
