The late Lower Paleolithic archaeofaunas of Qesem Cave in the southern Levant span 400e200 ka and
associate with Acheulo-Yabrudian (mainly Amudian) industries. The large mammals are exclusively
Eurasian in origin and formed under relatively cool, moist conditions. The zooarchaeological ﬁndings
testify to large game hunting, hearth-centered carcass processing and meat sharing during the late Lower
Paleolithic, not unlike the patterns known from Middle and Upper Paleolithic caves in the region. Welldeﬁned hearth features are rarely preserved in Qesem Cave, but the heterogeneous distributions of
burned bones indicate areas of frequent hearth rebuilding throughout the occupation sequence. The
hominins delayed consumption of high quality body parts until they could be moved to the cave, where
hearths were hubs of processing activities and social interaction. Paradoxically, the cut marks on the
Qesem bones are both more abundant and more randomly oriented than those observed in Middle and
Upper Paleolithic cases in the Levant. These results suggest that several individuals were directly
involved in cutting meat from the bones and that the social mechanics of meat sharing during the late
Lower Paleolithic at Qesem Cave differed from those typical of both the Middle and Upper Paleolithic in
the region.

Introduction
The ﬁnal burst in hominin encephalization between ca. 500 and
250 ka (Rightmire, 2003) would seem to be fertile ground for
exploring the evolution of social and economic behaviors. Yet
hominin economic and social lives in this interval remain something of a mystery in the Levant and elsewhere. The technological
record has received the most attention, thanks especially to its
consistent preservation. Information on subsistence has been more
elusive as a result of either poor preservation of features and faunal
remains or heavily cemented sediments from which bones are
difﬁcult to extract (Garrod and Bate, 1937; Rust, 1950; Jelinek et al.,
1973; Garrard, 1983; Weinstein-Evron et al., 2003). Recent discoveries of early Paleolithic horizons in open and shelter settings with
well-preserved bones are beginning to change this picture and,
along with revisiting of previously known sites, have stimulated
a new generation of intensive study in the Near East (e.g., Marder
et al., 1999; Goren-Inbar et al., 2000; Weinstein-Evron et al.,
2003; Chazan and Kolska-Horwitz, 2007; Monchot and Kolska* Corresponding author.

Horwitz, 2007; Rabinovich et al., 2008; see also Garrard, 1983 on
the Adlun caves, and Le Tensorer and Hours, 1989; Le Tensorer et al.,
2007 on the El-Kowm spring sites in Syria). What emerge from
these data are similarities between the late Lower Paleolithic (LP)
and early Middle Paleolithic (MP) in many of the basic aspects of
hunting. Some subtle but fascinating differences may exist as well,
particularly with respect to on-site activities and how sites were
used within hunting territories.
This multi-scale zooarchaeological study investigates the character of the meat diet in ecological and economic contextsdfrom
mammal community dynamics to hominin hunting to on-site
carcass processing and food sharingdduring the Acheulo-Yabrudian at Qesem Cave ca. 400e200 ka. Comparisons to other Lower
Paleolithic faunas in the region, and to unequivocally hunted faunas
of the early and late Middle Paleolithic at Hayonim and Kebara
Caves, set the Qesem results in broader perspective. Following
a brief review of regional trends in species composition, the faunal
comparisons will focus on cave sites. Caves represent stopping
points or endpoints in food transport trajectories. Thus we may
expect to learn about the later stages of carcass processing, delayed
consumption, and possibly food sharing from the archaeofaunas of
caves. Some of the greatest differences between the late LP and

214

early MP may relate to the simple mechanics of feeding and meat
sharing.
This study also considers whether there is a basis for arguing for
residential camps during the late LP in a broad sense, using
evidence for hearth-centered patterns of carcass processing,
delayed beneﬁts and cooperation. One may take for granted in
recent cultures the existence of residential camps or central places
to which food from diverse individuals or foraging events may be
brought, pooled and processed. All of this implies some degree of
sharing at a central place, where all group members might have
some access to the bounty of diverse foraging efforts. Even the MP
record supplies many good examples of this basic phenomenon.
Can we say the same or different for the late Lower Paleolithic?

Lower Paleolithic faunas of the Near and Middle East are rich in
large herbivores and surprisingly varied in content, ranging from
camels (Camelus spp.) and equids (Equus spp.) in the arid inner
basins of Syria (Reynaud Savioz and Morel, 2005) to predominantly
fallow deer and aurochs and/or megafauna in the coastal Mediterranean Hills area of the Levant (Tchernov, 1992). Open air and
cave faunas tend to differ in the importance of megafauna remains,
which occur in large numbers in some open sites (Tchernov, 1992)
and less commonly in cave deposits. Overall, ungulates ranging in
size from wild cattle to deer formed the core of hominin meat diets
in the Levantine LP sites that preserve faunal remains.

Background

Qesem Cave lies roughly 12 km east of the modern city of Tel
Aviv (Fig. 1b) at the interface of the Samaria Hills and the Mediterranean coastal plain (Barkai et al., 2003; Frumkin et al., 2009).
The cave was discovered by accident in 2000 during a highway
enlargement project. The roof of the cave and portions of its
deposits were damaged, enabling the discovery of a large and
previously sealed chamber that contained Pleistocene sediments,
lithic artifacts and well-preserved bones. Construction was brought
to a temporary halt to permit a large salvage excavation in 2000 and
2001. The remaining parts of the site are now protected by
a covered enclosure, and excavations continue within this area. The
bulk of the faunal sample discussed here comes from excavations
conducted between 2000 and 2005 and includes portions of the
site that no longer exist. The excavation grid is aligned with the
main axis of the collapsed cave chamber (Fig. 2), and the main
entrance faced SW.
Speleothems dated by 230Th/234U indicate that hominin occupations of the cave began around 400 (420e320) ka and ended
around 200 (220e194) ka (Barkai et al., 2003; Gopher et al., 2010).
No younger or later Paleolithic cultural horizons have been found in
the cave. The dates imply a long temporal span for the AcheuloYabrudian. The Qesem cultural deposits may be generally coeval

Levantine LP sites dating from roughly 1.4 Ma to 400 ka (Fig. 1a)
are deﬁned by the presence of Acheulean industries. Acheulean
artifacts occur in the later cultural layers of the ‘Ubeidiya formation
(Goren, 1981; Bar-Yosef and Goren-Inbar, 1993) and subsequently at
open sites such as Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov (Goren-Inbar and
Saragusti, 1996; Goren-Inbar et al., 2000), Revadim (Marder et al.,
1999), Holon (Chazan and Kolska-Horwitz, 2007), and Evron
Quarry (Ronen, 1991). Acheulean industries have also been found in
the lower layers of Tabun Cave (Jelinek et al., 1973; Ronen et al.,
2000), in the Adlun Cave complex (Roe, 1983), Berkhat Ram
(Goren-Inbar, 1985), Eyal 23 (Ronen and Winter, 1997), and possibly
in Layer G of Hayonim Cave (Meignen, pers. comm.). The Acheulean
sites of the LP provide important background to this research on the
ﬁnal phase of the LP known as the Acheulo-Yabrudian or "Mugharan" tradition (Rust, 1950; Jelinek, 1990). Acheulo-Yabrudian
industries are stratigraphically younger than Acheulean deposits in
Levantine caves (see Gopher et al., 2010) and have been recovered
from Layer E of Tabun (Jelinek et al., 1973), Layer F of Hayonim
(Meignen, 2000, 2007), the collapsed cave of Misliya (Zaidner et al.,
2006), and in Qesem Cave (Barkai et al., 2003).

with Layer E of Tabun and partly with layer F at Hayonim Cave,
where bones are rare or absent due to unfavorable sediment
chemistries (Margaris, 2000; Albert et al., 2000, 2003; Stiner,
2005). Faunal remains are abundant in Qesem Cave, by contrast,
and well preserved in lightly to moderately concreted sediments.
The lithic artifact assemblages from Qesem Cave are attributed
to the Acheulo-Yabrudian, but most of these are of the Amudian
industry, which emphasized a blade blank production system
(Barkai et al., 2005, 2009). At least one scraper-dominated Yabrudian assemblage was discovered in 2006 (Barkai et al., 2009),
however, testifying to some technofacies variation among layers or
horizontal units. Important to interpretations of carcass processing
at Qesem is the fact that so many of the tools were made on blade
blanks, including backed and retouched blades, end scrapers,
burins, and naturally backed knives (Barkai et al., 2005, 2009;
Gopher et al., 2005). Scrapers are present but comparatively rare,
and handaxes and so-called chopping tools are very rare. A small
number of limestone spheroids were found in the Lower Sequence.
Stratigraphic sections in the cave represent a total depth of about
7.5 m (Karkanas et al., 2007). An Upper Sequence and Lower Sequence
were distinguished on the basis of sediment composition and
structure. These sequences are subdivided further for the purpose of
the zooarchaeological study as Units IeII in the Upper Sequence and
Units IIIeV in the Lower Sequence (Table 1). According to Karkanas
et al. (2007), the Lower Sequence averages about 3 m in depth and
is dominated by clastic sediments deposited within a closed karstic
environment. These deposits formed mainly as small-scale, concentrated mud slurries and slow debris ﬂows. However, the incidence of ﬁne abrasion to bones is localized in the site, and severe
abrasion and in-situ contortions are very rare. The uppermost meter
of the Lower Sequence consists of limestone boulders with some

interstitial clays, whereas essentially intact layers (here called Units
IVeV) with mild internal reworking occur below. These oldest layers
formed when the cave roof was at its maximum extent. There is little
or no evidence of plant root activity and the sediments were well
protected from the outside atmosphere. Wood ash remnants are
present in well-deﬁned pockets/lenses in Units III, IV and V, though
usually in small amounts. Burned bone splinters (unidentiﬁed bone
specimens, NUSP) are abundant and occur in dense concentrations
throughout much of the Lower Sequence (Table 2). Burning damage
on the bones was conﬁrmed by a combination of microscopic
(Shahack-Gross et al., 1997) and macroscopic criteria (Stiner et al.,
1995). There is a notable concentration of well preserved wood
ash in the uppermost part of III, where burned bones are also
exceptionally abundant.
The Upper Sequence (Units IIeI) is different in character and
about 4.5 m deep. The stratigraphic transition from the Lower
Sequence is marked by several exposed large limestone boulders
(Karkanas et al., 2007). Part of the Upper Sequence lies horizontally,
and consists of anthropogenic sediment with only moderate
amounts of clastic geogenic inputs. Micromorphological and

isotopic evidence indicates widespread recrystallization of the wood
ash that also contributed to post-depositional splitting of skeletal
specimens (Karkanas et al., 2007: 202e203). Units IIeI are very rich
in wood ash, most of which was completely combusted and locally
reworked. Burned bones and moderately heated soil lumps associate with the wood ash remains, but the concentrations of burned
bone splinters in square M14 (the only deep sediment column in the

Upper Sequence that could be sampled systematically, Table 2) are
actually somewhat less than in several Lower Sequence contexts. It is
not yet clear if the difference in burned bone frequencies between
the Upper and Lower Sequences is explained by the more limited
excavation exposures in Units IIeI (Fig. 2). The frequent presence of
microscopic calciﬁed rootlets in the Upper Sequence indicates that
these sediments formed near the former cave entrance, which had

M.C. Stiner et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 60 (2011) 213e233

retreated by this time. The deposits of the Upper Sequence were
intensively fractured post-depositionally in some areas, but the
stratigraphic integrity is not signiﬁcantly disturbed overall.
The most pervasive indications of ﬁre use in Qesem Cave are
burned bones, probably because they are somewhat less vulnerable
to diagenesis than wood ash (see Karkanas et al., 2007). Burned
materials interpreted as hearth traces have also been identiﬁed at
older Lower Paleolithic sites (see Jelinek, 1981; Tsatskin, 2000;
Rolland, 2004; Preece et al., 2006) such as Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov
in the Levant (ca. 780 ka, Goren-Inbar et al., 2004; Alperson-Aﬁl,
2008; Alperson-Aﬁl and Goren-Inbar, 2010) and Beeches Pit in
the British Isles (MIS 11; Gowlett, 2006). At Qesem Cave, the
distribution of burned bone splinters through a deeply stratiﬁed
deposit indicates that ﬁre-building was a major activity throughout
the occupation sequence. The burned identiﬁed bones and bone
splinters also reveal a strong, consistent spatial connection
between ﬁre use and carcass processing in the cave (below).
Materials and methods
The zooarchaeological ﬁndings are based principally on
a sample of 4734 identiﬁed skeletal specimens (NISP, Table 3a)
taken from many excavation squares in the cave (Fig. 2); 2808 of
these specimens could be identiﬁed to species (Table 3b). About
78% of these identiﬁed remains were examined in detail for tool
marks, cone fractures, gnawing, weathering, and other surface
damage characteristics. In addition, 38,976 non-diagnostic bone
and tooth splinters (unidentiﬁed specimens or NUSP) were examined for burning damage, cut marks, cone fractures, and the density
of specimen occurrence in the sediments. Although the splinter
sample represents less than half of the entire collection and cannot
address all areas of the site equally, several deep sediment columns
were examined systematically to reveal general spatial variations in
the distribution of burned bone in particular. The skeletal samples
were recovered by 5 cm depth increments within layers and, horizontally according to 1  1 m squares in the salvage excavation and
50  50 cm sub-squares in all later excavation seasons. All sediments were screened through ﬁne mesh (2.4 mm) to capture
skeletal specimens of all sizes; areas yielding microfaunal remains
were water-sieved through 1 mm mesh (see Maul et al., in press).
The zooarchaeological analyses address several themes about
bone assemblage formation and hominin subsistence at Qesem Cave:
(1) the relations between geological and anthropogenic site formation
processes, (2) evidence of ﬁre based on burned bones, (3) primary and
secondary agents of bone collection and modiﬁcation, (4) prey
selection by the hominins based on species composition, mortality
patterns, and seasonality, (5) in situ decomposition of skeletal materials, and (6) patterns of carcass transport and processing that relate to
economic efﬁciency, delayed consumption, and food sharing. The
methods of analysis follow published standards for mortality
patterns, taphonomy, body part representation (Binford, 1978;
Lyman, 1994; Stiner, 1994, 2005; Stiner et al., 1995, 2001b, and references therein), density-mediated bone attrition (Lyman, 1994; Lam
et al., 1999; Stiner, 2004), and analytical units and coding procedures (Grayson, 1984; Lyman, 1994; Stiner, 2005: 235e240). The
analysis of tool marks builds upon existing methods for recognition
and recording but offers a novel approach for tracking variation in cut
mark orientations that relates to posture variation during butchering.
The zooarchaeological results for the ﬁve consecutive assemblages
from Qesem Cave are compared to Middle and Upper Paleolithic fauna
records from Hayonim (Stiner, 2005), Misliya (Yeshurun et al., 2007),
and Kebara caves (Speth and Tchernov, 2001, 2007) in the southern
Levant. The cave sites occur over a total distance of about 100 km
north-south along a narrow strip deﬁned by the coast and the western
slope of the Mediterranean Hills (Fig. 1b). These faunal series in

217

combination with the Qesem series form a nearly complete sequence
of hominin subsistence for the later part of the middle Pleistocene
through the late Pleistocene in the study area (Fig. 3). Data from
ızlı Caves I and II in the northern Levant (Kuhn et al., 2009; Stiner,
Üçag
2009) are brought to the comparisons of tool mark patterns, as these
assemblages are most comparable with respect to dominant prey
species, bone condition and surface visibility.
Prey species abundance in Qesem Cave is principally an indication of hominin prey choice, but these data also contribute to our
understanding of the regional biochronology of large mammals
during the middle Pleistocene. The latter is a dynamic story on
account of the unique geographic position of the Levant between
Africa and the rest of Eurasia (Tchernov, 1992). Hominin subsistence
during the Acheulo-Yabrudian is examined according to several
dimensions of predatory econiche (Stiner, 2002a), including the
antiquity of habitual large game hunting, the range of species and
prey body sizes commonly hunted, carcass handling practices, and
how supplementary sources were used to ﬁll gaps in the availability
of preferred large prey.
The analysis of prey age selection uses mortality patterns
determined from states of eruption and wear apparent on isolated
teeth. Fragmentation is severe in some of the Qesem assemblages,
and this condition may reduce the visibility of some types of teeth
more than others. This problem is overcome for deer, pigs and
bovids by cross-checking counts, condition and formation states of
contiguous dental elements. This approach was less successful for
equid teeth, owing to their highly laminar or platy structure.
The possibility of in situ bone attritiondloss of material to
mechanical decompositiondmay compete with behavioral explanations for biases in prey body part representation. This issue is
examined at Qesem Cave through comparisons of observed skeletal
representation to control data on inherent variations in the density
of skeletal structures and by comparing the representation of
similarly dense portions across the skeleton. The standards are
taken from Lam et al. (1999) and Lyman (e.g., 1984, 1994), and the
data are organized according to ﬁne portions-of-elements
following Stiner (2002b, 2004).
Hominin transport and processing tactics are interpreted from
bone damage patterns and body part representation in relation to
food utility indexes (following Binford, 1978; Metcalfe and Jones,
1988). Although bone surface visibility is sometimes obscured by
calcite concretions, tool marks, old green-break edges and diagnostic fracture, forms were readily visible and examined in relation
to prey size classes and body part representation, among other
variables. Additional, speciﬁc procedures are presented by analytical section below.

ever-shifting mixes of Eurasian, Afro-Arabian, Turanian, and
endemic inﬂuences. Several distinct zoogeographic zones fold
about one another in this part of the world (Fig. 4). Their undulating
borders have shifted frequently in the past, enhancing species
diversity through biotic exchange and periodic isolation (Tchernov,
1992; Horowitz, 2002). Invasions of the Levant by xero-tropical or
Afro-Arabian mammals were facilitated at times by a widening of
the southern arid grassland belt that linked the Levant to lowland
biomes of Ethiopia. The most famous example of this situation is
represented by the early Pleistocene faunas of the ‘Ubeidiya
formation in the Jordan Valley (ca. 1.4 Ma; Tchernov, 1992;
Martínez-Navarro, 2004). The archaeofaunal record at Gesher

a biogeographic cul-de-sac towards the end of the Lower Paleolithic, bounded on the south by an impenetrable Saharan belt.
The situation reversed quickly in the Mediterranean Levant with
the onset of the early Middle Paleolithic. Evidence from Hayonim
Cave (Stiner, 2005) and Misliya Cave (Yeshurun et al., 2007) reveals
a distinct northward invasion of Afro-Arabian mammals, particularly mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella), by 170þ ka or early in MIS
6 (Fig. 3; Stiner, 2005; Mercier et al., 2007). Gazelles may have been
in the Jordan rift earlier than this time, but they were absent or
rare in the coastal hills during the Acheulo-Yabrudian. Once
established in the hill zone, gazelle proportions continued to rise
relative to other ungulate species, particularly deer (Fig. 5), through
the late Pleistocene and Holocene (e.g., Speth and Tchernov, 2001,
2007; Stiner, 2005).
The incursion of mountain gazelles must relate in some way to
climate oscillations, though random historical events could also
have played a role (Groves, 1991; Tchernov, 1992, 1994; Blondel and
Aronson, 1999). Dorothea Bate’s (1937a,b) gazelle-fallow deer index
represents an early attempt to track environmental change in the

et al., 2008), also in the Jordan valley, may represent the tail-end of
this biotic exchange.
Although the Eurasian and African continents connect via the
Levant, the region was not always open to north-south biotic
exchanges (Horowitz, 2002). Many endemic forms arose during
periods of partial or complete geographic isolation caused by
expansion of a desert barrier. Two southward invasions of the
Levant by Eurasian Palearctic mammals associate with periods of
climate cooling over the last 1.5 M yr (Tchernov, 1992). The second
of these occurred during the middle Pleistocene and altered the
character of faunas after roughly 0.7 Ma (during the Acheulean). By
marine oxygen isotope stages (OIS) 7-6, biotic exchanges were
generally greater east-west than north-south (Tchernov, 1992), and
a variety of open-land genera such as Camelus, Equus, Dicerorhinus,
and Struthio (ostrich) inhabited the inland basins of Syria (Tchernov
et al., 1994; Reynaud Savioz and Morel, 2005).
The savannah conditions that dominated the Levant after
roughly 700 ka allowed Palearctic mammals to be increasingly
successful. Tchernov et al. (1994) suggest that this effect intensiﬁed
through the Acheulo-Yabrudian culture period, based on the
mammalian records of Oumm Qatafa, Zuttiyeh, and Tabun F-E. The
exclusively Palearctic mammal spectrum of Qesem Cave is consistent with this assessment and implies that the southern Levant was

southern Levant based on the relative importance of mountain
gazelles and Mesopotamian fallow deer (Dama [dama] mesopotamica). She proposed that an increase in the proportion of gazelles
relative to deer signaled greater aridity. Tchernov (e.g.Tchernov,
1992) likewise viewed gazelles as an important paleoclimate
signal of vegetation changes and Afro-Arabian inﬂuences in large
mammal communities of the Levant.
Interpretation of variation in the gazelle-fallow deer index
during the Pleistocene is complicated by the fact that only two or
three species dominate Levantine ungulate faunas. A decline in one
almost always means an increase in the other (Davis, 1982). Detrended analyses of gazelle, deer and tortoise data have been used
to address this issue for the Hayonim Cave faunas (Stiner, 2005:
137e139). The approach demonstrates that fallow deer frequencies
do not control the appearance of the trends from ca. 200/170 to
11 ka, and that gazelle frequencies shift independently for the most
part. Other lines of evidence lend further support to Bate’s interpretation of the gazelle-fallow deer index. Speleothem records
from Soreq and Peqiin Caves (Bar-Matthews et al., 2003) indicate
cooler, wetter conditions between 250e185 ka in the Levant and for
the eastern Mediterranean as a whole. This interval is followed by
a marked shift to arid conditions between ca. 200e170 ka. Significantly, the only example of Lycaon (Cape hunting dog) documented
outside of Africa in the middle Pleistocene or later (MartínezNavarro and Rook, 2003) makes its appearance at Hayonim Cave
early in this aridiﬁcation trend (Fig. 3; Stiner et al., 2001a). Stable
carbon and oxygen isotope values (d13C, d18O) of gazelle and fallow
deer tooth enamel (bioapatite) yield d18OSMOW values with a range
of þ26.2 to þ34.9& (Rowland, 2006). Though signiﬁcant temporal
gaps exist in the sample, average d18OSMOW values increase by w4&
over the last 300 k yr. and conﬁrm a trend of increasing aridity.
Microfaunal studies at Qesem have only just begun (Maul et al., in
press) and are also expected to bear on the environmental history
of the cave and surrounding area.
The rather abrupt appearance of gazelles, Lycaon, and ostrich egg
shell in the earliest MP (late middle Pleistocene) may associate with
a threshold-like expansion of open land habitats and fragmentation
of Mediterranean forests in the coastal Mediterranean hills. The
Qesem series immediately pre-dates this important biotic shift.

inferred route (arrows in inset image) of re-entry of Afro-Arabian large mammals ca.
200 ka into Mediterranean Hills study area (base map adapted from Blondel and
Aronson, 1999).

Finally, 3 hominin anterior teeth are part of the study sample. These
specimens were recovered from Square G22 at 685e710 cm below
datum. More cranial elements have been recovered elsewhere during
recent excavations (Hershkovitz et al., in press).
The Qesem species spectrum most closely resembles the
Acheulo-Yabrudian fauna from the Adlun Caves in Lebanon
(Garrard, 1983). The near or total absence of gazelles places these
two cases at the Palearctic extreme of the biotic continuum.
Because Qesem Cave is located well to the south of Adlun (Fig. 1a),
its uniformly Palearctic composition for macromammals indicates
a deep penetration of cooler conditions and/or a distinct precipitation regime into the southern Levant. The singular dominance of
fallow deer though the entire Qesem sequence is also striking.

Prey spectrum
Bone modiﬁcation and assemblage formation
Signs of hominin activity dominate the Qesem faunas, and there
is surprisingly little variation in the prey spectrum through time
(Table 3). Fallow deer (Dama cf. mesopotamica) were the main prey
(73e76% of specimens identiﬁed to species), supplemented by
aurochs (Bos), horse (Equus, caballine form), wild pig (Sus scrofa),
tortoise (Testudo cf. graeca), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and wild ass
(Equus cf. hydruntinus). Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus hemitoechus),
porcupine (Hystrix indica), and small ungulates (goat [Capra
aegagrus] and roe deer [Capreolus capreolus]) are present, but rare,
in the assemblages. Gazelle is virtually absent.
The meat diet of the hominin occupants was narrow in its focus on
large game. The central importance of ungulates in the meat diet
suggests that the Qesem hominins were accomplished large game
hunters. Tortoises were the only small prey animal of any importance.
A few bones of a predatory bird and partridge (probably Alectoris
chukar) occur in the older layers (Units IIIeV), but they are very rare
and their connection with the hominin occupations is unclear.
Medium mammal remains are mainly of porcupine (Hystrix indica),
and there is no evidence of small mammal hunting. Hyenas, another
potential bone collector in caves, are represented by sparse skeletal
remains (I3, P3) only in Unit III of 1e2 adolescent/young adult individuals. A few hyena coprolites are scattered among the vertical units
(5 coprolites in Unit III, and 1 in Unit IV) but no latrines were found.

Lithic artifacts co-occur consistently with bones that were
damaged by tools, ﬁre or both. The faunal remains generally are
well preserved (Fig. 6), and tool marks are present on the surfaces
of many of the bones (Table 4) but particularly on limb shaft fragments (Table 5). Cut marks are simple types with V-shaped crosssections made by slicing motions (Potts and Shipman, 1981; NoeNygaard, 1989; Fisher, 1995). These marks occur on 9e12% of the
ungulate bone fragments (Table 4), except for the very small sample
from Unit I. Cone fractures from stone hammers, typical of marrow
extraction from limb bones and mandibles (Binford, 1978; Potts,
1988; Blumenschine and Selvaggio, 1998), occur on 19e31% of
ungulate bone fragments; they are somewhat more frequent in the
older layers. The incidence of tool marks is comparatively high in
the Qesem ungulate faunas, at least twice that observed for a wide
range Mediterranean Middle and Upper Paleolithic cave faunas
with similar patterns of body part representation (Table 6; Stiner,
1994, 2005). Hacks marks are rare in the Qesem sample, and long
axial scrape marks known from MP and later sites are entirely
absent. The hack marks associate with limb-sectioning and marrow
processing.
Gnawing damage from carnivores and hyena coprolites are
present in some of the Qesem assemblages, but they are quite rare

(Tables 2 and 4). No rodent gnawing damage was found, although
some porcupine bones are present. Burning damage is common on
the remains of ungulates and tortoises (12e19%, Table 7) and
demonstrates the economic importance of these animals to the
hominins. Burning damage occurs at lower frequencies on porcupine bones (“large rodent” in Table 7, 8%), and it is possible that
some or all of these were prey of hominins. The bones of large birds
(probably owl) and hyenas were never burned, probably because
these animals were occasional visitors to the cave rather than
hominins’ prey.
Many of the breaks on bones are from butchering and marrow
processing by the hominins. Much additional fracturing occurred
after the organic fraction of the bones had decomposed, but long
before the cave was opened by roadwork. Like many other Paleolithic sites in the Levant, Qesem Cave occurs in a geological
formation that is rich in springs (Bar-Matthews et al., 2003;
Frumkin et al., 2009). Thin-section analyses of sediment blocks
reveal that micro-cracks and pores of the bones were inﬁltrated by
precipitating calcium compounds (Karkanas et al., 2007: 201e203).
Crystallization of these compounds propagated further splitting
and cracking of the bones and teeth.
Articulated skeletal specimens in the Qesem deposits (Table 8)
are conﬁned to the most resistant joins, namely teeth in jaws and
unions of the radius and ulna of deer. Articulated specimens are
fairly common in the small sample from Unit I (12%) but uncommon
(1e2%) in all other units. Some scattering of materials may have
occurred after the bones were discarded by hominins. The scale of
post-depositional disturbances is further qualiﬁed by burning and
anatomical evidence below.
Weathering damage from exposure to the sun is rare overall
(Table 4) and mild where it occurs, suggesting widespread
protection by the cave roof, rapid burial or both. In fact, weathering

damage is restricted to areas of the excavation thought to represent
the cave entrance, the position of which shifted generally N-NE
with time. The presence of calciﬁed rootlets places the cave
entrance at the far SW end of the site during the formation of the
Lower Sequence (Karkanas et al., 2007: 199), and the concentrations of mildly weathered bones in squares H20e21 of Unit IIIeIV
and in square E22 of Unit V support this conclusion. Large quantities of fallen rock testify to the migration of the cave entrance
thereafter. Weathered bones in Unit II of the Upper Sequence
concentrate in squares J8, K10, L14, and M14 (see Fig. 2). No
weathered bones were encountered in Unit I.
As explained above, intact hearth features thus far are rare in
Qesem Cave (Karkanas et al., 2007), but burned unidentiﬁed bones
(splinters or NUSP) occur in patchy distributions throughout the
stratigraphic sequence (Table 2). In square I15, between 570 and
665 cm below datum, up to 91% of the splinters are burned and 16%
calcined. Up to 88% of splinters are burned and 33% calcined
between 540 and 765 cm in square I16. Other “hotspots” include cut
650 in square G22 (51% burned, 16% calcined), and between 600
and 800 cm in square G21 (up to 70% burned, 25% calcined).
Of the bones that could be assigned to species or body size group
and element (NISP), 12e15% are burned in Units I-III and 8e10% are
burned in Units IVeV. The higher frequencies of burning damage to
unidentiﬁed bones in Qesem are typical in archaeological cave sites.
Burning increases the brittleness of bones and teeth, such that
trafﬁc or compression generates smaller pieces with fewer diagnostic features. Small items that stay where they fall are also prone
to secondary burning by ﬁres built repeatedly in the same location
(Walters, 1988; Stiner et al., 2001b), even if the bones are shallowly
buried (Stiner et al., 1995). Extensive burning may also result from
the use of bones as fuel (Théry-Parisot, 2002) or from cooking (Cain,
2005; Speth, 2006). None of these explanations can be rejected
a priori for Qesem Cave. It is signiﬁcant, however, that carbonization
is often complete, and calcined bones are common in some locations (up to 33% of NUSP). Such high concentrations of calcined
bone in the Qesem deposits testify to intense or long-burning ﬁres.
Perhaps most important for our discussion is the fact that
burned bones are much more abundant in the Lower Sequence
than preserved wood ash traces would predict. The low incidence
of the latter seems to be explained by poor ash preservation rather
than absence of ﬁre technology in the behavioral repertoire of the
hominins. Also interesting is the observation that the distribution
of burned bone trends horizontally in a manner akin to weathering
damage and the drifting position of the cave entrance with time.
This is especially the case for calcined bone fragments, which are
produced only in the hottest zone of a campﬁre. The co-occurrence
of weathering damage and concentrations of burned bones near
the cave entrance makes sense with respect to ventilation.

Prey age selection and seasonality
The mortality patterns of the Qesem fallow deer (Table 9) speak
to the hunting capabilities of early hominins and the development of
prime-age-focused harvesting, a uniquely human predatoreprey
relationship (Stiner, 1990). Ungulate mortality patterns are mediated foremost by how a predator approaches its quarry. A fundamental division exists between the death patterns produced by long
chase hunters (wolves, wild dogs, cheetahs, spotted hyenas), which
tend to kill young, old or weak individuals and produce attritional or
U-shaped mortality patterns, and stalk-and-ambush hunters (lions,
tigers, leopards) that are generally less selective and whose large
prey kill patterns are more likely to resemble the structure of the
living prey populations. The contrasting ways that chasers and
stalkers interact with a prey population in the same environment
reduces interference competition and reﬂects a long legacy of niche
differentiation (MacArthur and Levins, 1967; Pianka, 1978:189e199,
260). Humans are ambush predators, but they are somewhat more
selective than other predators in this strategy group, producing
mortality patterns in artiodactyl ungulates that range from nonselective to a bias to prime adult animals. In terms of averages, a mild
bias to prime animals has been noted in a variety of recent and
prehistoric contexts, and the human species is ecologically unique in
this respect (Stiner, 1990, 1994). The nearly universal character of
this human adaptation begs information about its antiquity.
To set the Qesem results in evolutionary context, broad prey age
selection patterns are generalized by predator type in Fig. 7b as
averages of many cases (following Stiner, 1990). Expectations for
nonselective and selective hunting patterns are modeled in tripolar
format based on the relative proportions of juveniles, prime adults,
and old adults that are killed (Fig. 7a). This approach exposes nichelevel differences between non-human and human predators,
wherein the distances that separate means (or groups of means) are
as important as their location in the graph. The mean values
generated by humans are consistent across periods and

technologies, and all of the human means are distinct from those of
the non-human predators. The averaged mortality pattern for the
ﬁve fallow deer assemblages from Qesem Cave is consistent with
MP through recent means. Clearly, the recent human pattern was
already developed in hominins 400 ka, if not earlier.
Moving to a higher level of resolution in the data, Fig. 8 represents the full gamut of variation in artiodactyl mortality patterns
generated by recent humans and Middle, Upper and Epi-Paleolithic
foragers in Israel, Italy, Turkey, and Lebanon (Kersten, 1987; Stiner,
1994, 2005; Speth and Tchernov, 1998; Yeshurun et al., 2007). The
ﬁve Qesem assemblages are highlighted in this graph, and their
distribution is consistent with that of the MP and later cases. All of
the Qesem fallow deer mortality patterns are poor in old adults
(Fig. 9), somewhat more so than some of the other Paleolithic
comparison cases. One may wonder whether this is evidence of
over-hunting or the result of fallow deer herd composition and
season of hunting (Kersten, 1987: 121; Stiner, 1994, 2005: 207e210;
Steele and Weaver, 2002). The latter explanation is supported by
the presence of ungulate fetal and neonate remains; at least some
adult females and their young were hunted during the spring
(3 infant specimens from Unit III, 6 from IV, and 3 from V). The
rarity of antler fragments in the Qesem deer assemblages is also
notable. Assuming that hunters would not avoid male prey, the
paucity of deer antler points to seasons of occupation that included
late winter through early summer. Other suggestions of seasonal
occupation include the very similar wear stages of some deer teeth
(e.g., Fig. 10), implying that these individuals died not only in the
same year of life but also at the same time of the year.
Finally, it is interesting and unusual that only the posterior teeth
of the mandible are exceptionally well-represented in the medium
ungulate remains from Units III and IV (Fig. 11). Of concern for the
mortality analysis is whether the molar biases in III and IV have
substantively altered the mortality patterns. Hence a comparison of
proﬁles based on fallow deer premolars only (dLP4-LP4) and
premolar-molar sets (dLP4-LM3) was undertaken. The comparisons
(Table 10) conﬁrm that an emphasis on the premolar-molar set
results in a greater proportion of prime adults in the results. Still, all
of the premolar- and molar-based patterns fall within the total
range of living-structure and prime-dominated patterns; they are
not greatly different from one another. It is difﬁcult to retreat to an
argument of poor preservation or counting error to explain the
higher representation of lower molars in relation to other cheek
teeth for deer, since upper molars generally are no less dense or
recognizable than lower molars. It is possible that some posterior
mandibles were separated from the anterior mandible before
arriving to the site during the formation of Units III and IV (but not
in other layers). Biases to metapodial elements in the bone
assemblages are also greatest in these units (see below).
Carcass transport and processing on-site
Although well-deﬁned hearth features are rare or absent in the
cultural layers, the condition of the bones nonetheless testiﬁes to

strong, consistent links between carcass processing and ﬁrebuilding over the full span of the hominin occupations. To better
understand the causes of this spatial association, the frequency and
intensity of burning damage was examined by body part for deer
and other medium-sized ungulatesdthe most abundant prey size
group. Bones of the skull, axial column (spine, ribs, pelvis), scapula,
and ulna are less often burned than the large limb bones that
possess large medullary cavities (Table 5), a seasonally rich source
of consolidated bone marrow. Intense burning damagedcalcinationdis also most frequent on limb bones (Table 11;
Chi-square 54.6, df 16, p < 0.0001).
Burning damage is least common on skull parts, even though
roasting would have been the simplest and most efﬁcient way to
prepare ungulate heads for consumption. The equivalent frequencies of crania and mandibles in this site indicate that skulls were
often carried to the site in a relatively complete state. The equal
rates of burning on crania and mandibles may mean that the skulls
were roasted whole, and the low rate of burning may be because
the tissue covering shielded the fresh skull bones and teeth from
the ﬂames and coals of the hearths.
Speth and Clark (2006: 20e24) were able to relate the frequency
of burning damage on deer and gazelle bones in late Middle
Paleolithic Kebara Cave (ca. 60e50 ka) to marrow utility rather than
meat utility. These authors also found that many of the lower limbs,
the elements most often burned, sustained greater heat damage on
the shafts and speciﬁcally on their exterior surfaces. This pattern of
burning suggests gentle heating of the lower limb bones in preparation for marrow removal in the manner not unlike the practices
of some recent foraging peoples (e.g., among the Nunamiut;
Binford, 1978). The distribution of burning by skeletal element for
fallow deer in Qesem Cave resembles that observed for the Kebara.
The only exception concerns toe bones, which are abundant and
frequently burned in Kebara but rarely present and seldom burned

in Qesem. Greater burning damage to limb bones in Qesem Cave
suggests that late-stage processing and discard of these elements
normally occurred in the vicinity of hearths.
While burning biases by skeletal element at Qesem do suggest
deliberate heating in connection with marrow processing, there is
at least one other important modifying process in evidence. The
ends and shafts of ungulate limb bones in Qesem are burned at
similar rates. The limb bones do not appear to have been used as
supplemental fuel (compare Théry-Parisot, 2002), since grease-rich
limb ends were burned no more often than limb shafts. Rather, the
indiscriminant burning of disparate limb bone portions merely
indicates that the fragments tended to remain in hearth areas after
disposal and were prone to random post-depositional burning.
Of the small prey animals in the Qesem faunas, tortoises are
both more abundant than birds or small mammals and much more
frequently burned (19% on average). The degree of burning damage
is consistently mild, and it is more frequent on the plastron or belly
plate of the shell than on the carapace or limbs (Table 12). A similar
pattern was observed for the early Middle Paleolithic faunas from
Hayonim Cave (Stiner, 2005: 98e99). This bias may reﬂect the
method of roasting.
Differential transport versus in situ attrition Ungulate body part
representation in caves ideally reﬂects the transport decisions of
hominins and the contexts of carcass processing and consumption.
Greater travel distances are expected to discourage the transport of
low utility (Binford, 1978) or very heavy parts (Metcalfe and Barlow,
1992). Unfortunately biases arising from in situ decomposition of
softer bones can produce body part patterns in faunal records
that are similar to those caused by transport preferences. In
Qesem Cave, the problem of in situ attrition is largely a matter of
fragmentation, not chemical decomposition or gnawing by
carnivores or rodents. Because crushing and splitting may reduce
the visibility of fragile skeletal parts disproportionately (Brain,
1969; Lyman, 1984, 1991), a ﬁrst test for this effect compares the
representation of dental versus bone elements of the skull for
deer (Stiner, 1994: 99e103). The assumption is that bones and
teeth of the crania and/or mandibles will tend to be moved
together in the hands of foragers. In Qesem Cave, the highest
dental MAU values (minimum anatomical unit; Binford, 1978) are

two times greater than the highest bone-based MAUs in each unit
(slope ¼ 0.43, Fig. 12; Table 13); the situation is slightly worse in
Unit III and somewhat better in Unit IV than predicted by linear
regression. Clearly fragmentation has taken a toll on the
recognition of bone elements relative to dental elements in the
Qesem faunas.
Portion-of-element representation for medium ungulate leg
parts tells a related story. A plot of limb MAUs based on unique,
dense shaft features versus small epiphyseal features yields a slope
of 0.578 (Fig. 12), meaning that shafts are nearly twice as abundant
overall. Deviations from the regression line (residuals) expose
a noisy relation, however, with an r2 of only 0.495 (N portion
pairs ¼ 21). The proximal radius, for example, is a major outlier to
the distribution in that proximal ends are more abundant than
shafts and this element is much more abundant than other limb
elements. Metapodials are also disproportionately common in the
assemblages (see below); they could not be considered in this
comparison due to the lack of countable shaft features, but their
structural densities are not substantially different from many other
parts of the lower leg.
The observed biases in body part representation can be
compared systematically to independent bulk density standards for
members of the deer family (Cervidae), based on photon densitometry (PD) technique for Odocoileus (Lyman, 1994) and computed
tomography (CT) for Rangifer (Lam et al., 1999). Application of the
CT standards includes adjustments made for the voids within large
tubular bones (BMD2; Lam et al., 1999). We note that PD standards
for Odocoileus and CT standards for Rangifer are in close agreement
to each other for limb bone portions considered in this study,

(N ¼ 17, r ¼ 0.871, p ¼ 0.0001), but less so if other parts of the
skeleton are included (rs ¼ 0.674, p ¼ 0.001). For the range of body
parts represented in the Qesem faunas, PD and CT density standards are strongly correlated, as one would expect, but there is only
about 45% agreement between the two standards. This discrepancy
between the control sets is mildly problematic and cannot be
resolved here, but the standards remain useful as one of several
approaches to questions about bone survivorship.
Correlation results presented in Table 14 indicate that in situ
destruction has the potential to explain 18e34% of the variation
seen in body part representation among units in Qesem Cave if PD
standards are used, but only 4e19% of the variation if CT standards
are used. Unit V may have been most affected by in situ attrition and
Unit IV least affected. We conclude that preservation biases could
partly account for the low frequencies of fragile vertebrae and ribs
in Qesem Cave. None of these results explains, however, the low
frequencies of dense pelvic features, proximal femur, distal tibia,
and phalanges in the Qesem assemblages. In other words, the
anatomical content of the ungulate faunas was also strongly
inﬂuenced by hominin transport biases.
Correlation to bone density standards helps to identify the
possibility of density-mediated effects, but these tests seldom can
exclude other potential inﬂuences on body part representation
(Lyman, 1991; Beaver, 2004). To circum-navigate biases that may
have been introduced by density-mediated destruction, the next
comparison uses parts (portions-of-elements) with similar
inherent densities throughout the prey skeleton (Stiner, 2002b,
2004). Small, compact features on bones are favored for counting
elements and portions-of-elements. Most of these portions coincide with Lyman’s PD scan sites (1994: 234e250), which are also
the basis for the CT data produced by Lam et al. (1999). The
numbers of skeletal elements (MNE) are grouped into nine
anatomical regions and standardized to a complete skeleton model
(standardized MNE, Stiner, 1991; or MAU, Binford, 1978) by dividing
the observed MNE for a group of elements (body region) by the

expected MNE. If skeletal representation is complete, the standardized values for all regions will be equal, making biases among
the anatomical regions readily apparent. To correct for the greater
durability of teeth in fossil records, only bony features of the skull
are used to estimate the number of crania and mandibles for this
analysis.
Medium and large ungulates in Qesem Cave are represented
mainly by limb bones and head parts (Fig. 13). The metapodials,
humerus, radius, femur and tibia are particularly common (Fig. 14),
whereas vertebrae, ribs, pelves, and toe bones (phalanges) are
under-represented to a notable extent. The differential representation of similarly dense portions across the anatomy conﬁrms that
the biases are the result of hominins’ decisions of what to carry
from kill sites to the cave. The patterns of body part representation
for deer in Qesem Cave are consistent among the vertical units,
suggesting that the hunters used the cave in a generally similar
manner visit after visit. The patterns of body part representation for
deer are similar to those observed for deer and mountain gazelle in
the early MP sites of Misliya Cave (Yeshurun et al., 2007: 665) and
Hayonim Cave (Fig. 15; Stiner, 2005: 184e192).
Deer body part representation in Qesem Cave correlates (positively) only to the marrow utility index (Units IIeV, Table 14).
Clearly, the presence of medullary marrow in bones was an
important condition for transport of body parts to the cave. The
hominins’ decisions were not determined entirely by marrow
value, however, as this utility index can explain no more than 25%
of the variation in body part representation in Unit II, 35% in III, 59%
in IV, and 31% in V. Marrow was merely the most consistent
residual value of the transported parts. Many of the transported

skeletal elements associate with large muscle masses in life, and
the utility correlation results show that it is very unlikely that all
meat was removed from the bones in the ﬁeld. Whether all or just
some of the meat remained on the bones at the time of transport is
not known. What we do know is that the bones have many cut
marks on them and the patterns do not suggest efﬁcient processing.
Rather, the cut marks indicate a protracted set of cutting actions. If
meat was still attached to the transported bones, then we may
conclude that hominins delayed consumption of some high-value
food until after it had arrived in the cave. The fact that hominins
also carried heads of deer and other ungulates to the site could be
explained by the presence of hearths in the cave, since heads have
considerable food value but require lengthy processing, usually by
slow roasting.
Butchering patterns and hearth-centered processing Interpretations of cut mark data normally rely on three or four variablesdtool mark forms or morpho-types, tool mark orientations,
abundance, and the distributions of the marks on prey skeletons. This
study considers all of these variables and, in addition, the amount of
angle variation within clustered cut marks as a measure of “disorder.”
The basic patterns of carcass transport and processing at Qesem Cave
do not differ substantially from those noted for a variety of later
Paleolithic cave faunas, nor do the dominant orientations of the cut
marks (Table 15). These patterns fall within the range normally
associated with full butchering of ungulate carcasses, including

basic skinning work. The anatomical placements of most cut marks
in the Qesem faunadmainly on limb shaftsdare also generally
consistent with those in the MP and UP comparison assemblages.
The Qesem faunas are peculiar for the relative “disorderliness”
of the cut mark orientations on limb shaft specimens that possess
multiple marks (Stiner et al., 2009). Many of the shaft fragments
from upper limb bones display loose aggregations of cut marks
(3e44 strokes; Fig. 16a, Table 16a). The high incidence of crossed
marks and the diverse angles of the cut marks on the Qesem bones
(Fig. 16b) are peculiar if compared to MP and UP faunas from
Mediterranean cave sites (Stiner, 1994, 2005). One potential
explanation for this contrast is that the marks on the Qesem bones
are actually palimpsests of hominin butchering marks and
geological scratches (cf. Tchernov et al., 1994). If scratching were the
cause of the relatively chaotic marks, there should be stray marks
on most elements; scratching from small-scale sediment movements or trampling (Behrensmeyer et al., 1986; Fisher, 1995) should
not be very selective with respect to body part. In fact, the great
majority of the cut marks in the Qesem faunas are concentrated on
just a few meat-bearing elements, primarily the humerus, femur
and tibia (Fig. 17; Table 16b). These marks lack the morphological
diversity of scratches and evidence of sequential polishing. The
possibility that some bones with multiple marks were used as
palettes or percussors was also considered (Chase, 1990), but the
specimens in the study sample do not show evidence of repeated
tapping or striking against a stone edge.
Unfortunately, there are no systems-level analogs for evaluating
the behavioral signiﬁcance of cut mark data. Inter-assemblage
variation in cut mark frequencies is the most problematic variable
(see Lyman, 2004: 303e315; 2005), because frequencies may differ
as a function of the technological system, prey type, environmental
circumstances, carcass state, and processing investments (Binford,
1978, 1988; Gifford et al., 1980; Bunn and Kroll, 1986; Lupo and
O’Connell, 2002). Archaeofaunal variation in cut mark abundance
is further complicated by variation in body part representation
(Stiner, 1994: 138e139; Domínguez-Rodrigo and Yravedra, 2009),
observer bias (Abe et al., 2002), specimen counting conventions
(compare Stiner, 2005: 10; Speth and Tchernov, 2007), and bone
surface preservation.

Cut mark orientations and anatomical placements are more
useful in that they have been linked in ethnoarchaeological
contexts to skinning, dismemberment, deﬂeshing, ﬁlleting
(removal of whole or large muscle masses), and other butchering
actions. Binford’s (1978, 1981) model, developed mainly from ethnoarchaeological work among the Nunamiut Eskimo, is widely
applied by archaeologists and notions of its general usefulness have
withstood the test of time. The Nunamiut system for butchering
carcasses is exceptionally complex, however, causing Binford (1981,
1988) and others (e.g., Nilssen, 2000) to question the wholesale use
of these patterns for interpreting pre-modern hominin subsistence
behaviors. Other ethnoarchaeological studies conducted in African
contexts (e.g., Bunn et al., 1988; Yellen, 1991; Lupo, 1995, 2006;
Lupo and O’Connell, 2002) expose much diversity in how
carcasses may be treated by people and how the bones will be
marked by tools. There is wide agreement that cut marks on the
shafts of “meaty” bones will generally reﬂect deﬂeshing actions.
The relation between the effort expended removing residual tissue
and numbers of cut marks that may be generated is more controversial (compare Shipman and Rose, 1983; Bunn and Kroll, 1986;
Bunn et al., 1988; Bunn and Blumenschine, 1987; Lyman, 1987,
1994: 299-303; 2005; Binford, 1988), and must be approached with
caution in the case of Qesem Cave.
Because hominin and prey anatomies vary less across time and
space than do ecological circumstances, we can expect basic consistencies in the mechanical features of butchering and tool marks
wherever and whenever certain classes of hand-held stone tools are
used. Biomechanical analogs in particular may have widespread
applicability owing to common physical constraints, quite unlike
analogs that involve complex goal-driven socioeconomic strategies.
Experimental butchering has assisted in development of the former
(e.g., Bello et al., 2009), but only to a point, since the underlying

economic and social goals of early hominins are not known. Some of
the mechanical implications of the patterns, such as cut mark
orientations, are within reach, assisted by comparisons to suitable
MP and UP cases.
An important source of control for this study of cut marks is
consistency in the observer (M.C.S.) and methods of observation,
site and environmental situation (caves at the coastal plainehills
interfaces, Fig. 1b), prey types, concretion effects, and quality of
preservation. Ecologically, the mammals represented in Middle
Pleistocene Qesem Cave have much in common with the northern
Levant (southern Turkey) during the late Pleistocene. The MP and
ızlı II and I, respectively, are from
UP comparison samples from Üçag
this region and formed under similar climatic and geological
environments. These sites also contain the same or similar prey and
body parts (Kuhn et al., 2009) and have a degree of surface preservation and visibility comparable to that of the Qesem sample.
Counting cut marks can be a problem in Levantine cave faunas,
owing to the severity of calcite concretionsdthe early MP from
Hayonim Cave is avoided as a comparator for this reason (Stiner,
ızlı I early UP reference
ızlı II MP and Üçag
2005: 83) and the Üçag
samples used instead. All of the sites contain multiple stratigraphic
layers and faunal assemblages, and the cut mark samples represent
time-averaged patterns.
It is interesting that cut marks in the Qesem faunas occur at
roughly 3 times the rate observed in a variety of MP and early UP
cave faunas (see Table 6), even though the observer was always the
same. Cone fractures also occur at a much higher rate in the Qesem
faunas. This is equally strange since the comparison faunas are also
rich in limb bones, and these elements were thoroughly processed
for medullary marrow (Stiner, 1994, 2005; Munro, 2004; Yeshurun
et al., 2007). If fewer hammer strikes to a long bone element (and
hence cone fractures produced) are sufﬁcient to open marrow

cavities during the MP or UP periods, then the Qesem pattern
appears to have been less efﬁcient, or less discriminating, in the use
of force (see also Bello et al., 2009 on handaxe use at Boxgrove).
The types of tool marks on the Qesem ungulate bones indicate
a narrower range of ﬂesh cutting and removal activities than in the
MP and UP comparison assemblages; speciﬁcally, axial scrapes and
long cuts are absent at Qesem Cave. The most common cutting tools
in the Amudian deposits of Qesem Cave were unmodiﬁed blades
(Barkai et al., 2005; Gopher et al., 2005; Lemorini et al., 2006) and
small ﬂakes (Barkai et al., 2010), and tool edges seldom were
renewed. Use-wear data on a spatially limited sample of blades
from square K10 (Lemorini et al., 2006) suggest short use lives for
the majority of these artifacts.
There is also the matter of the chaotic appearance of some of the
cut mark orientations. A quantitative comparison of variation in cut
mark angles tests the possibility of greater disorder in the Qesem
ızlı Caves II
assemblages relative to MP and early UP cases from Üçag
and I, respectively (Stiner et al., 2009). Here the cut marked specimens are exclusively compact bone fragments from limb shafts,
many but not all of which could be attributed to skeletal element.

assemblage in the order in which they were encountered during
general zooarchaeological analysis and therefore are representative. Low-level microscopy (up to 20) was used to identify tool
marks. Measurements of cut mark angles were made on highresolution digital images, with the natural long axis of the bone
oriented vertically.
The sequence in which marks were made by hominins is not
known, and hence marks were recorded following a nearestneighbor rule. Angle measurements on each bone specimen began
at the lower left area of the image and advanced to the next closest
mark until the angle of every stroke was recorded (Fig. 18). The
differences in angles between adjacent cut marks were calculated
for the bone specimendalways between 0 and 90 , since the start
and ﬁnish of each stroke is not knowndfollowed by calculation of
the mean of these angle differences. This second statistic, called the
"mean difference of adjacent angles"dor MDAAdis the main
parameter used to estimate the amount of variation in cut mark
angles per specimen. Given that fragment surface areas could affect
the number and average orientation of cut marks (Rapson, 1990;
Abe et al., 2002), we also estimated fragment surface areas (cm2)
by multiplying the length by the width.
A comparison of MDAA values is presented in Fig. 19. Each point
represents one bone specimen with multiple cut marks on its
surface, and the results are ordered by increasing value to show
general tendency for each faunal assemblage. The MDAA per specimen clearly is more variable in the LP. This is true in spite of the fact
that fragment sizes (surface areas in cm2) are smaller in the LP
sample, and greater on average in the later samples (Table 17). The
negative relation between surface area and MDAA is the opposite of
what one would expect if lesser surface area had reduced the chance
of detecting multiple (multi-oriented) strokes on a given bone
specimen. Although the cut mark orientations in the Qesem faunas
are indeed more chaotic than in the later cave faunas, it would be an

exaggeration to claim that the Qesem cut marks are entirely
haphazard. This is not the case; MP and UP cut mark samples merely
exhibit greater regularity, with careful or lighter use of tools and
more consistent orientations of cut marks over small areas of bone.
The diverse cut mark orientations suggest that butchering postures,
or the ways of holding a body part while cutting away the meat, may
have been more varied at Qesem Cave. Wider comparisons to other
sites are needed to fully evaluate this phenomenon in the late LP, but
the observed differences among the study samples are highly
signiﬁcant (see Stiner et al., 2009 for a complete statistical analysis).
Discussion
The Qesem results present three themes, each with its own set of
surprises. The ﬁrst of these concerns the rather “modern” appearance

of several hominin patterns or animal exploitation. The second theme
instead focuses on late LP hominin behaviors that seem to contrast
with those of the earliest MP though UP. The ﬁnal theme is biogeographical and relates to the prevailing conditions of climate and the
large mammal community during the late LP. These biogeographical
indications imply an origin for the hominin population as well.
Modern behavior has both deep and shallow roots
Large game hunting is frequently appealed to as a deﬁnition of
“modern” human behavior. This monolithic generalization has little
ecological traction in theory, and is eroded increasingly by data on
the Middle Paleolithic. Attention is now turned back to the LP, an
admittedly vast period. The possibility of large game hunting
during the LP has up to now been investigated mainly from
patterns of carcass access, using data on body part representation
and tool marks. In the Levant, cut marks on fallow deer at the
Acheulean open site of Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov indicate primary
access to carcasses, and it seems likely that these deer were hunted
by hominins rather than simply scavenged. A case for hunting may
also be made for the MIS 13 occupations at Boxgrove in England
(Parﬁtt and Roberts, 1999). Ungulate body part patterns and
contextual data from the late middle Pleistocene sites of Hayonim
(early MP), Misliya (early MP) and Qesem (late LP) in the central
Levant, and at least two sites in Germany, the early MP at Wallertheim and the late LP of Shöningen (Gaudzinski, 1995; Thieme,
1997), all provide strong evidence for large game hunting.
Prime-age-biased prey selection at Qesem Cave adds further
support for large game hunting by late LP hominins and extends the
history of this niche characteristic back to at least 400 ka. Habitual
prime-age-focused hunting of artiodactyl ungulates is ecologically
unique to humans, differing as it does from the common patterns of
prey age selection by sympatric canids, felids, and hyaenids. The
behavior certainly was present in human systems of the early MP,
and it was practiced throughout the Old World by Upper Paleolithic
times. Just how pervasive or long-standing prime-age-biased prey
selection was during the LP is not known. Comparisons to archaeofaunas greater than 1 Ma in East Africa, for example, are prevented

M.C. Stiner et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 60 (2011) 213e233

by the low incidence of head parts in the sites, which in itself may
testify to important differences in predatory tactics between the
early and late LP (see Potts, 1984; Bunn and Kroll, 1986;
Brantingham, 1998; Klein, 1999: 243). Given what is known at
present, however, we may expect to ﬁnd signiﬁcant transitions in
predator niche between 1 Ma and 500 ka (Stiner, 2002a).
The Qesem results are essentially the same as the Levantine
early MP in the pattern of prey age selection for large game.
Another similarity is found to the MP (but not the UP) with respect
to small game hunting in that these prey are only slow moving
types characterized by high return rates, mainly tortoises (Stiner,
2001, 2005).
The Qesem hunters delayed consumption of some high quality
meaty and marrow-rich parts until these items could be moved to
the cave. This behavior is widely expressed in the MP and later
Paleolithic as well. Ethnographically, foragers’ decisions about
which prey body parts to transport depend upon food value, weight
and travel times between kill sites and safe havens. In the absence
of grease-rendering technologies, greater distances are expected to
discourage the transport of low utility or very heavy parts to camps.
Although the efﬁciency of the processing technologies is a mediating factor in transport decisions (e.g., grease-rendering), LP and
MP processing technologies were less elaborate. To Qesem Cave,
hominins transported head parts and high quality upper and lower
limb segments of their prey, and they left most of the axial and foot
bones behind at kill sites. There is, in addition, a consistent bias
against low utility body parts. The consistency of the bias in the
Qesem sequence suggests that these hunters were mobile as a rule.
Hearths clearly were magnets for carcass processing activities
upon arrival to the cave. Burning damage on bones is pervasive and

often intense. Roasting accounts for only a fraction of this damage,
since burning frequencies differ by skeletal element but not by
element sub-portions, and specimens generally are charred
through-and-through. The ﬁrst observation indicates intentional
and highly preferential redistribution of prey parts in relation to
hearths. The other observations indicate indiscriminate (i.e., accidental) post-depositional burning of debris, probably from frequent
hearth rebuilding and burning-over of debris that was never
cleared away.
The zooarchaeological results from Qesem Cave seem to raise
the uniquely human metaphor of “hearth and home,” as there is
evidence for deferred beneﬁts, divided foraging efforts from
a central place, cooking, and presumably meat sharing. What does
such a foraging base at 400e200 ka imply for hominin social
evolution? There is no information on the intentions of the
hominins who carried meat to Qesem Cave. However, it would
have been very difﬁcult to avoid sharing meat at a small central
destination, even if the foragers were attracted mainly by the
advantages of processing meat at a facility with a reliable heat
source. Intentions in this context matter less from an evolutionary
standpoint than the outcomes of meat distribution among group
members.
Meat sharing is a central feature of recent hunter-gatherer
societies (Hawkes et al., 1991; Kelly, 1995; Winterhalder, 1997;
Binford, 2001; Gurven, 2004; Bird-David, 2005; Ichikawa, 2005;
Layton, 2005). Meat sharing is a powerful social gesture, because
meat (especially meat that contains fat) is a high quality food and
among the most difﬁcult of resources to harvest in large packages.
Meat sharing behavior should therefore signal important evolutionary developments in hominin social relationships (e.g., Hawkes
et al., 1991). G. Isaac (e.g., Isaac, 1978) proposed that clustered bones
and stone artifacts in East Africa were evidence of food-sharing at
home bases as early as 2 Madreciprocity at a central place made
divided labor and resource pooling increasingly worthwhile. Isaac’s
application of the model to early hominins has since been rejected
in favor of simpler explanations such as transporting food to safe
places in order to buy processing time (Potts, 1984, 1988). Recently,
this stimulating question has been reframed around the issues of
when and how food processing hubs may have also become
selective forums for complex social maneuvers and cooperation.
For Wrangham et al. (1999), ﬁre technology is the key, as ﬁre was
simultaneously a means for extracting energy from food and the
environment more efﬁciently and a artiﬁcial forum that pulled the
possibilities for social evolution onto a new path (Foley and
Gamble, 2009). As such, ﬁre became both an aid and an anchor in
social networking (Gamble, 1999). Gowlett (2006) argues, for
example, that some kind of division of labor was needed to

maintain ﬁre and a more extensive social network to reclaim it if
a hearth went cold.
Dunbar’s social brain hypothesis (e.g., Dunbar, 2003) is most
explicit about the mechanics of selection in constrained social
spaces. In cultural systems, ecological challenges are increasingly
solved socially in day-to-day interactions. Building upon the Theory
of Mind concept (Premack and Woodruff, 1978; Churchland, 1984;
Dunbar, 1998), Dunbar shows how these social solutions require
more elaborate networks built on empathy and an ability to model
the intentions of other individuals. Such mental processes put
heavy demands on the neocortex area of the brain, the part that
underwent rapid expansion in archaic humans between ca. 500 and
250 ka. Increases in group size, or perhaps just more complex social
negotiations among individuals, produced an intense selective
environment that was bound foremost by its energetic efﬁciency, in
spite of the rising social costs.
Fire technology may have emerged well before 500 ka, but the
record of ﬁre makes a considerable leap in ubiquity only after this
time. Perhaps Isaac’s home base emerged in the later Middle
Pleistocene. Whether sharing was intended or unavoidable in
hearth-centered social spaces early on is less important than the
realization that sheltered spaces were intensely social spaces that
posed a unique set of selective conditions. Social roles and contracts
could change rapidly under these conditions.
Qesem provides support for the "social brain" hypothesis. The
Qesem faunas formed well before AMH are known to have been
present in the study area (see Bar-Yosef, 2000). However, human
dental remains from Qesem Cave studied recently show close
morphological resemblance to the Skhul and Qafzeh hominins
(Hershkovitz et al., in press), thus leaving this point open. Clearly
the late Middle Pleistocene was a very dynamic phase in hominin
behavioral evolution and some so-called modern behaviors have
deep roots.
Not so modern
The archaeological and geological evidence from Qesem Cave
supports a scenario of repeated short-term, probably seasonal,
visits by the hominins. A similar situation is suggested for the late
LP occupations of Tabun Cave (Clark, 2008) on the basis of greater
technological repetition in the Acheulo-Yabrudian lithic industries
than in the MP. The patterns of variation in the late LP seem to
have been mostly about the position of the site within the overall
territory and the frequency of visits.
Butchering activities in Qesem Cave involved a limited range of
tasks, mainly simple deﬂeshing and marrow extraction. The types
of tool marks and their anatomical placements on the ungulate
bones are redundant, abundant and heavy-handed. There is no
evidence of specialized or multi-staged butchering procedures, in
marked contrast to the early MP through UP. Most of the cut marks
occur on upper limb shaft fragments, areas associated with large
masses of soft tissue in live prey. All of the major bone cavities were
opened for marrow, and lower limb bones were burned more often
than any other skeletal part. When cut marks occur in patches on
limb shaft fragments in the Qesem faunas, the orientations are

somewhat more chaotic than expected. The MP and early UP
samples instead exhibit a “surgical” quality, with careful use of tools
and much consistency in cut mark orientations.
The diverse cut mark orientations at Qesem suggest that
butchering postures, or the ways of holding a body part while
cutting away the meat, varied a great deal. The cut mark patterns of
the MP and early UP samples exhibit greater regularity, with more
consistent orientations of cut marks over small areas of bone. The
Qesem tool users also appear to have been less precise, or less
concerned with precision, in their efforts to separate soft tissue
from the bones. Their goals and contingencies may have differed as
well.
Among recent humans, the butchering of large animals nearly
always involves a chain of focused tasks performed by one or just
a few persons, and the butchering process tends to produce wellaligned marks on bone surfaces. These observations have social
signiﬁcance in that butchering procedures guide many of the
formalities of food distribution and sharing that follow. Whereas
few hard and fast rules about ﬁeld butchering and body part
transport exist among recent foragers (Lyman, 1994; Lupo and
O’Connell, 2002; Domínguez-Rodrigo and Yravedra, 2009), the
social valuation of meat sharing is universally high and the chains
of transfer are often complex.
As a matter of procedural efﬁciency one individual in these
circumstances will tend to produce series of aligned marks, as long
as their posture remains constantdso the mean difference
between adjacent angles will be low. Given that a skillful modern
butcher can take apart a deer carcass with minimal tool damage to
bone surfaces, most cut marks on bones from prehistoric sites are
probably incidental to or errors in the butchering process. Some
errors must be due to variation in individual skill. Additionally, the
consequences of chipped stone tool edges meeting bone may vary
from neutral to costly with respect to raw material availability,
investment in tool production, tool maintenance or some combination of these factors. The degree of redundancy and the cumulative pattern of errors in an archaeological culture therefore may
reveal something about the organization of the technological
system and costs, not to mention the social interactions of which
the technology was a part.
The butchering patterns at Qesem Cave are somewhat at odds
with what we are accustomed to ﬁnding in the faunas generated by
foragers of later Paleolithic periods and suggest a distinct method of
communal feeding. Hypothetically, we may be seeing evidence of
a simpler or less evolutionarily derived pattern of meat consumption that was social but less canalized than those typical of MP and
later humans. The evidence for procedural interruptions or diverse
positions while cutting ﬂesh at Qesem Cave might reﬂect, for
example, more hands (including less experienced hands) removing
meat from any given limb bone, rather than receiving shares
through the butchering work of one skilled person. Several individuals may have cut pieces of meat from a bone for themselves, or
the same individual may have returned to the food item many
times. Either way, the feeding pattern from shared resources
appears to have been more individualized than is typical of later
cultures, with limited or no formal "apportioning" of meat.
The differences in cut mark angle variation between the LP and
later samples in this study are statistically robust. Only continued
comparisons can conﬁrm (or disconﬁrm) the differences we
suggest for the mechanics of meat sharing between the late LP and
the rest of the Paleolithic. The Qesem results also beg for
a conceptual unpacking of terms such as “systematic” butchering
and “dexterity” from an evolutionary point of view. It is too easy at
present to reach opposing conclusions from the same or very
similar kinds of data on carcass processing. This is less a problem of
observation and recording than it is one of the frameworks used for

M.C. Stiner et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 60 (2011) 213e233

interpretation. Experimentation and ethnoarchaeology have
proved their value for exposing the sources of possible variation
and its causes, but only within the limits of modern human
tendencies. Basic biomechanics and anatomy represent the few
common threads through time that may allow us to draw inferential links to ancient tool use, even if the hominins were physically
stronger and the prey bigger or smaller in the past. If the tendencies
noted at Qesem Cave for tool mark patterns prove to be widespread,
the data may expose subtle but potentially important differences in
the practical and social mechanics of meat sharing between the late
Lower Paleolithic and the Middle Paleolithic.
Biogeography
The Acheulo-Yabrudian faunas of Qesem Cave formed when
Palearctic animals dominated the Mediterranean coastal hills
region. By ca. 400 ka, when the Qesem series began to form, the
Afro-Arabian species once common to the southern Levant had all
but disappeared. In fact the taxonomic spectrum of the Qesem
faunas most closely resembles those of the Acheulo-Yabrudian and
early MP faunas of the Adlun Caves, located 150 km to the north.
The strictly Eurasian character of the Qesem macrofaunas represents a compositional extreme in the biochronology of the southern
Levant.
The monotony in prey species composition through 7.5 m of
cultural strata in Qesem Cave could be taken either as evidence for
relatively short intervals of cultural accumulation within the
framework of a longer geological chronology or long-term consistency in environmental conditions. However, speleothem data
suggest that cool-moderate conditions may have characterized the
entire span from 400 to 200 ka; the later part of the faunal series
seems to fall within MIS 7 (Gopher et al., 2010), a long “interglacial”
stage preceded and followed by moderate glacial conditions.
The large mammal community of the Mediterranean hills area
underwent another signiﬁcant change around the time of the
Lower-Middle Paleolithic transition, apparently with the close of
the Qesem sequence. A sudden inﬂux of mountain gazelles
between 200 and 170 ka coincides with the early MP at Hayonim
and Misliya caves. The success and growing numbers of gazelles in
the study area thereafter suggests an expansion of open land
habitats and fragmentation of woodlands. Environments of the
Jordan Rift valley to the east and arid grassy basins to the south
must have re-joined at this time.
Qesem presents us with a distinct combination of “modern” and
pre-modern socioeconomic behaviors in late LP hominins. The
biogeographic evidence tells us that these developments unfolded
in a distinctly Eurasian biotic context, independent of the inﬂux of
Anatomically Modern Humans that soon followed.
