Hominin presence is well documented in a number of Early Pleistocene and early Middle Pleistocene
European localities. However, the evidence currently available indicates that Acheulean handaxes spread
in the ﬂuvial basins of Western Europe during MIS 11, w400 kyr ago, associated with Homo heidelbergensis, although a number of early Middle Pleistocene Acheulean assemblages have been dated
from MIS 16 onwards. For this reason, the magnetostratigraphic dating in Southeast Spain of two
archaeological localities, the open-air site of Solana del Zamborino (SZ) and the rock-shelter site of Cueva
Negra del Estrecho del Quípar (EQ), that put back the appearance of handaxes to the Early-Middle
Pleistocene limit (Scott and Gibert, 2009) is of particular interest, as the new ages suggest that
H. heidelbergensis was a contemporary of H. antecessor that had the ability to produce Levallois debitage
and to control ﬁre during the Early-Middle Pleistocene transition. However, we have detected a number
of errors in the interpretation of the archaeological assemblage from the ﬁrst site as well as striking
discrepancies with the original faunal lists published for both localities, with several large mammal
species that are omitted or arbitrarily changed to make the assemblages consistent with the new ages
deduced from magnetostratigraphy. For this reason, we suggest that: (1) the ﬁnding of reverse polarity in
the sediments sampled for paleomagnetism in SZ may simply record one of the polarity reversals that
took place during the Brunhes Chron, although the use by Scott and Gibert (2009) of a composite
stratigraphic column precludes correlating these levels with a speciﬁc reversal; and (2) the fauna and
tools of EQ correspond to the late Middle Pleistocene sedimentary inﬁllings of this karst site, while the
samples taken for paleomagnetism belong to a previous sedimentary cycle during the Matuyama Chron.
Such interpretations would be in better agreement with the age estimates provided by biostratigraphy
and also with the currently accepted chronology for the appearance of Acheulean industries in Western
Europe.

1. Introduction
During the last two decades, a number of issues related to the
earliest arrival of the genus Homo in Europe have been subject to
intense debate, including the chronology of the ﬁrst human settlements (e.g., Dennell and Roebroeks, 1996, 2005; Dennell, 2003;
Moncel, 2010), the dispersal routes (e.g., Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen,
2001; Nikitas and Nikita, 2005), the techno-cultural developments

of the population that dispersed out of Africa (e.g., Carbonell et al.,
1999, 2010; Antón and Swisher, 2004; Toro et al., 2009, in press)
and both the ecological context and climatic conditions in which this
dispersal event took place (e.g., Arribas and Palmqvist, 1999;
Martínez-Navarro, 2004, 2010; Rook et al., 2004; Turner & O’Regan,
2007; Agustí et al., 2009).
Up to the mid-nineties, most researchers believed that there
was no signiﬁcant habitation in Europe before Middle Pleistocene
times, thus favoring a “short chronology” (Carbonell and Rodríguez,
1994; Roebroeks & van Kolfschoten, 1994) for the earliest permanent human settlements (i.e., 600e500 kyr, as evidenced in the
sites of Boxgrove and Mauer; Roberts et al., 1994; Wagner et al.,
2010). However, this chronology was shortly overturned by the
discoveries of Early Pleistocene human remains and tools in

J.M. Jiménez-Arenas et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 38 (2011) 3340e3349

a number of sites from Atapuerca, Spain (Carbonell et al., 1995,
2008; Bermúdez de Castro et al., 1997, 2010). In addition, an early
dispersal of Homo out of Africa is now well documented by the
ﬁnding of Oldowan tools and human skeletal remains in Dmanisi,
a Caucasian locality at the gates of Europe dated at w1.8 Myr
(Gabunia and Vekua, 1995; Gabunia et al., 2000, 2001; de Lumley
et al., 2002; Vekua et al., 2002; Lordkipanidze et al., 2005).
Cranial remains of this population are broadly similar in shape to
African Homo ergaster (Rosas and Bermúdez de Castro, 1998;
Arribas and Palmqvist, 1999; Vekua et al., 2002; Rightmire et al.,
2006) and show an unexpectedly high level of sexual dimorphism. A very large mandible was ascribed to a new human species,
Homo georgicus (Gabunia et al., 2002), although this taxonomic
asignment is far from being unanimously accepted. According to
Lordkipanidze et al. (2007), the Dmanisi hominins display a mosaic
of plesiomorphic traits (e.g., small body size, high degree of sexual
dimorphism, low encephalization and absence of humeral torsion,
as in Homo habilis) and derived features (e.g., modern-human-like
body proportions and lower limb morphology indicative of the
capability of traveling long distances, as in H. ergaster). In addition,
a recent study on the craniometric variability in the genus Homo
has shown the morphological afﬁnities between African H. habilis
(s.l.) and the Dmanisi population (Jiménez-Arenas et al., in press).
The Dmanisi population is the only one found out of Africa showing
a genuine Oldowan artifact tradition (Mgeladze et al., 2011), which
indicates that the earliest members of Homo that dispersed in Asia
had not developed an Acheulean technology by these times
(however, it should be kept in mind that classiﬁcation of industries
from wide-spread regions as ’Oldowan’ is not necessarily useful;
see discussion in Shea, 2010).
Hominin presence is well documented during the Early Pleistocene and early Middle Pleistocene at a number of Western European
sites (e.g., Barranco Leon and Fuente Nueva-3 in the Orce region,
southeast Spain; Sima del Elefante and Gran Dolina TD-6 at Atapuerca, northwest Spain; Pirro Nord, in Italy; Happisburgh-3 and
Pakeﬁeld in England), with ages between w1.4 and w0.7 Myr
(Arzarello and Peretto, 2010; Arzarello et al., 2007; Carbonell et al.,
1995, 2008; Bermúdez de Castro et al., 1997, 2010; MartínezNavarro et al., 1997; Falguerès et al., 1999; Oms et al., 2000;
Palmqvist et al., 2005; Moncel, 2010; Parﬁtt et al., 2010). In addition, a number of Mode 1 assemblages dated between 1.57 and
1.0 Myr have been described in several European localities (e.g., Pontde-Lavaud, Lezignan and Le Vallonnet in France; Monte-Poggiolo
and Pirro Nord in Italy; Vallparadis in Spain; see review and references in Moncel, 2010), but there are reservations on both their age
and stratigraphic position, as well as on the artifacts themselves.
Comparative analyses of the faunal assemblages from these
European sites with those from Africa, the Near East and Asia
provide increasing evidence that hominins did not disperse alone
out of Africa, but were accompanied by other immigrants such as
the saber-tooth felid Megantereon whitei, the short-faced hyena
Pachycrocuta brevirostris, the jaguar Panthera gombaszoegensis, the
hippo Hippopotamus antiquus, and the giant gelada Theropithecus
oswaldi (Martínez-Navarro and Palmqvist, 1995, 1996; Arribas and
Palmqvist, 1999; Martínez-Navarro, 2004, 2010; Rook et al.,
2004). However, while it seems clear that some of these immigrants dispersed into Europe from Africa, as they are found in the
Levantine corridor (e.g., H. antiquus and M. whitei) and the Caucasus
(M. whitei) but not in Southern and Central Asia, the dispersal of
others (e.g., P. brevirostris) would in all probability be from Asia, as
they were extinct in Africa by Early Pleistocene times (Palmqvist
et al., 2007, in press).
It is worth stressing the chronological and technological distance
between the African Oldowan and the European Mode 1 technocomplex. Oldowan industries in a strict sense range in Africa eand

3341

also in Dmanisie between w2.6 and w1.5 Myr (Semaw, 2000). These
tools are usually associated with H. habilis, although a number of
hominins could also potentially be the Oldowan tool-makers. In
contrast, the Acheulean techno-complex spreads after the emergence
of H. ergaster. This reinforces the hypothesis pioneered by Isaac (1971),
in which the Developed Oldowan industries that appear later and last
up to the Middle Pleistocene are considered as a behavioral and/or
ecological facies of the Acheulean Industrial Complex. Such an interpretation was initially proposed for the lithic assemblages from Olduvai and Ubeidiyah, and later for the Middle Awash (Hay, 1976; BarYosef and Goren-Inbar, 1993; Clark and Shick, 2002). A uniﬁed technological interpretation has also been proposed also in Europe for the
Acheulean and for the Middle Pleistocene lithic assemblage without
handaxes of Venosa-Notarchirico (Piperno, 1999). However, in order
to test whether the European Mode 1 represents an Acheulean facies,
as in Africa, it would be necessary to conﬁrm the presence of
Acheulean industries in the Early Pleistocene, with similar chronologies to those of the oldest Mode 1 assemblages. La Noire in France
(Moncel, 2010) is a locality to bear in mind, and a ﬁrst evidence in the
Iberian Peninsula could be Cueva Negra del Estrecho del Río Quípar
(Scott and Gibert, 2099), although in the latter site only a single
handaxe from a poorly speciﬁed technological and stratigraphic
context has been reported (see below). An alternative hypothesis that
must be considered is that the European Mode 1 had an Asian origin,
not directly linked to Africa, which is supported by the Asian afﬁnities
of the skeletal remains attributed to Homo sp. from Sima del Elefante
(Atapuerca, Spain), the oldest known in Europe (Bermúdez de Castro
et al., 2011). In any case, it is worth pointing out that, on the one hand,
the one-to-one association of hominin species with speciﬁc technocomplexes is not necessarily secure. On the other, the assemblages
from most of the late Early Pleistocene and early Middle Pleistocene
sites in Europe are relatively small (e.g., Carbonell et al., 1999; Toro
et al., 2009; Parﬁtt et al., 2005, 2010), which makes it difﬁcult to
identify the technology present and assess whether handaxes are
likely to have been present had the assemblage been larger (Santonja
and Villa, 2006: pp. 432e433).
Acheulean industries emerged in Africa between 1.65 and
1.5 Myr (Asfaw et al., 1992; Roche et al., 2003; Gibbon et al., 2009;
Semaw et al., 2009), but they spread on the ﬂuvial basins of
Western Europe during MIS 11, w400 kyr ago (Tuffreau and Antoine,
1995; Bridgland et al., 2006; Antoine et al., 2010; Santonja and
Pérez-González, 2010). There are, however, a number of early
Middle Pleistocene localities with Acheulean tools dated from MIS
16 onwards, including Venosa-Notarchirico (w640 kyr) in Italy, La
Noire and the lower levels of L’Arago in France, or Boxgrove in
England (Piperno, 1999; Lefevre et al., 2010; Despriée et al., 2009;
Falguères et al., 2004; Roberts and Parﬁtt, 1999). The only tool
found in the Iberian Peninsula with a similar chronology is the
handaxe from Sima de los Huesos, in the karstic complex of Atapuerca (Carbonell et al., 2003), which has an age estimated in
>530 kyr (Bischoff et al., 2007). Although the lithic evidence from
this site only consists of this tool, it represents the clearest association between the Acheulean techno-complex and skeletal remains
of Homo heidelbergensis.
The persistence of Mode 1 industries in Europe, especially in the
Iberian Peninsula ewhere the spread of the Acheulean complex took
place w1 Myr later than in Africa, as dicussed beforee has been
tentatively related to the survival of saber-tooth cats in this continent until the Middle Pleistocene (Martínez-Navarro and Palmqvist,
1995, 1996; Arribas and Palmqvist, 1999). The reason is that these
predators, given their highly specialized dentition, left abandoned
ungulate carcasses with large amounts of ﬂesh and all bone nutrients intact. Such resources, crucial for the subsistence strategies of
hominins in a temperate environment, could be subsequently
scavenged with the sharp ﬂakes and manuports (i.e., unshaped

3342

cobbles and split cobbles) characteristic of Mode 1 assemblages, in
competition with the giant, short-faced hyena P. brevirostris, as
evidenced in the Orce sites (Palmqvist et al., in press).
The ecological scenery changed dramatically in the Middle
Pleistocene with the replacement in Europe of saber-tooths by
African pantherine cats such as lions and leopards, predators that
were able to exploit in more depth the carcasses of their prey
(Arribas and Palmqvist, 1999). This forced the hominins toward
behavioral and technological improvements that resulted in the
development of the more effective industries of H. heidelbergensis,
which replaced the technologically less elaborated tools of earlier
populations, increasing the hunting abilities during the Middle
Pleistocene (e.g., as evidenced by the wooden throwing spears from
Schöningen, w400 kyr; Thieme, 1997). In contrast, the destiny of
the short-faced hyenas, constrained by their enormous size and by
a highly specialized anatomy derived from their scavenging
behavior, was extinction (Martínez-Navarro, 2004, 2010; Palmqvist
et al., 2007, in press).
The appearance of the Acheulean techno-complex in Southwestern Europe would be the consequence of an early Middle
Pleistocene dispersal from Africa of new human contingents.
The technological variability e archaic Middle Palaeolithic and
Acheulean e seen in this region during the second half of the Middle
Pleistocene could even indicate the coexistence of different
populations (i.e., the descendants of the Early Pleistocene inhabitants
and the newcomers). Under this interpretation, a parallel transition e
but delayed w1 Myr e to the one experienced in Africa between the
Oldowan and Acheulean techno-complexes would not take place in
Europe (Santonja and Villa, 2006; Santonja and Pérez-González,
2010). In fact, the possibility of a second dispersal event during the
Middle Pleistocene is favored by Templeton (2002), who traced from
molecular data a more recent out of Africa expansion between 0.84
and 0.42 Myr. According to Hublin (2009), the simultaneity between
the emergence of bifaces in Europe and the occurrence of similar
forms of hominins on both sides of the Mediterranean (i.e.,
H. heidelbergensis in Europe and H. rhodesiensis in Africa) can be seen
as the likely result of an out of Africa event in the Middle Pleistocene,
the Acheulean being imported into Europe by a new species of largebrained hominins which replaced the earlier populations that
developed Mode 1 tools. This dispersal event seems to coincide with
the appearance in Europe of auroch Bos primigenius, a species
originating in the African lineage Pelorovis (Martínez-Navarro et al.,
2007, 2010b; Martínez-Navarro, 2010), and also with the arrival of
a number of African carnivores (e.g., lion Panthera leo, leopard
P. pardus and spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta) well known in the
Middle Pleistocene of Europe (Arribas and Palmqvist, 1999;
Martínez-Navarro and Rabinovich, 2011). The result of this faunal
turnover was a change in the interactions between ﬂesh-eating and
bone-cracking species of the carnivore guild (Palmqvist et al., in
press), which opened up an opportunity for H. heidelbergensis to
colonize Europe bearing the Acheulean technology.
Given the arguments discussed above, the dating in Southeast
Spain of handaxes that put back the appearance of Acheulean tools
to the Early-Middle Pleistocene limit (Scott and Gibert, 2009) is of
particular interest, because the ages reported on the basis of
paleomagnetic data are w200 kyr older than those considered
previously for the earliest Acheulean in Western Europe, which
contradicts the currently accepted chronology for hominin
dispersal and adaptation in the late Early and early Middle Pleistocene of Europe. In fact, the age considered for one of the sites, in
which skeletal remains of H. heidelbergensis have been found
associated with a single handaxe, is even older than the one
considered for level TD-6 of Atapuerca, in which a Mode 1 tool
assemblage is associated with H. antecessor (Carbonell et al., 1995;
Bermúdez de Castro et al., 1997).

2. Acheulean tools in the Early Pleistocene of Europe: turning
water into wine?
In an intriguing article (Scott and Gibert, 2009), the Acheulean
tool assemplages from two archaeological localities, the open-air site
of Solana del Zamborino (SZ) in the Guadix-Baza basin of Granada
and the rock-shelter site of Cueva Negra del Estrecho del Quípar (EQ)
in Murcia, are dated by paleomagnetic polarity to w760 kyr and
w900 kyr, respectively, which implies that they would be substantially older than those found anywhere else in Europe. In addition,
given that hominin teeth, initially identiﬁed as early Neanderthals
(Walker et al., 2006b) but later as H. heidelbergensis (Walker et al.,
2010), were also found at EQ, the new dating also means that the
Neanderthal forerunners (i.e., H. heidelbergensis cf. steinheimensis)
lived during the Matuyama Chron and were contemporary with
H. antecessor.
However, we have detected a number of errors in the interpretation of the archaeological assemblage from the ﬁrst site as
well as striking discrepancies with the original faunal lists published for both localities. In our opinion, the inconsistencies in the
composition of the faunal assemblages, with arbitrary changes of
names for large mammal species that tend to make older the
assemblages, in agreement with the new chronologies, put serious
reservations on the ages proposed by Scott and Gibert (2009) for
these localities. For this reason, conclusions on the oldest Acheulean chronology in Europe should be revised.
Scott and Gibert (2009) sampled magnetostratigraphically a thick
(>150 m) sedimentary sequence dominated by ﬂuvial deposits
which includes the SZ fossil quarry excavated by Botella et al. (1976),
reporting on the ﬁnding of 14 m of reverse polarity below the levels
with the tools and 12 m of normal polarity within and above these
beds. For this reason, they concluded that the artifact layers are
positioned immediately above the Matuyama/Brunhes polarity
reversal, with an age for these deposits of 770e750 kyr (i.e.,
10e30 kyr after the polarity change). This age interval was estimated
using the sediment accumulation rate from a “stratigraphically
equivalent” section at Cúllar Baza-1, a locality some 40 km distant in
the Baza subbasin (Gibert et al., 2007) composed of carbonate
lacustrine sediments that differs from the Guadix subbasin, where is
located SZ, as the latter shows a predominance of alluvial sediments
(García-Aguilar and Palmqvist, in press). However, it is worth noting
that in the lithostratigraphic column that shows the paleomagnetic
samples (Scott and Gibert, 2009: Fig. 2), ﬁve out of the seven samples
with reverse polarity situated below the artifact layers were not taken
in the vertical excavation face of SZ. In fact, the stratigraphic
description of the samples in which magnetic polarity was measured
is insufﬁcient and, given that the depth of the stratigraphic proﬁle at
the SZ site (w30 m; Scott and Gibert, 2009: Fig. 1) did not allow them
to take all the samples studied, it seems that a number of sedimentary
sequences from different places were combined in a composite
stratigraphic column. Under these circumstances, it is difﬁcult to
place the levels of the excavation quarry of SZ that provided the tools
in relation to the polarity reversal with conﬁdence. In any case, it
seems clear that the lowest samples with reversed polarity are not
from the main proﬁle with the alleged Acheulean artefacts (for
a stratigraphic diagram of paleomagnetic sampling, see Scott and
Gibert, 2009: Fig. 1).
In addition, Scott & Gibert, (2009: SI, Fig. 4) reproduce one of the
handaxes dated from SZ. In the legend of this ﬁgure, it is
acknowledged that this handaxe, which appears in the upper row,
was taken from a previous publication of Botella et al. (1976). Scott
and Gibert (2009) report the tool as coming from the base of section
in the excavation quarry. However, Botella et al. (1976: Fig. 6, p. 34)
describe it as a “cordiform handaxe found in the surface”. Consequently, although there is no doubt that the handaxe comes from

J.M. Jiménez-Arenas et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 38 (2011) 3340e3349

3343

its original stratigraphic context but was derived from higher up
the proﬁle.
The tool assemblage of SZ consists of heart-shaped and lanceolate handaxes made on quartzite and ﬂint as well as single, double
and transverse sidescrapers. Some of the published handaxes are in
fact tool(s)-on-handaxes ebifaces support d’outil(s)e and thus
complex techno-functional units (Boeda, 2001), which are well
documented in the archaic Middle Palaeolithic of Europe: for
example, in the Iberian Peninsula they appear in the Middle
Member of Ambrona (Santonja and Pérez-González, 2006), with an
age estimated by combined ESR and U-series of 350 Kyr. The two
handaxes of SZ reproduced by Scott and Gibert (2009: SI, Fig. 4) are
retouched in several portions of their edge to obtain scrapers
(Fig. 1). In sum, they are tools-on-handaxes that are not characteristic of the Acheulean techno-complex. The lithic industry of SZ
was preliminarily considered as Upper Acheulean (Botella et al.,
1976: p. 36) and other researchers opened the possibility that it
would correspond to the Middle Palaeolithic (Vega Toscano, 1989:
p. 337). Indeed, both interpretations converge, because the European tools deﬁned previously as upper or ﬁnal Acheulean are now
considered as facies of the archaic Middle Palaeolithic (Monnier,
2006), a concept that ﬁts well with the lithic industry of SZ.
Moreover, the archaeological record of SZ provides evidence of
an anthropic ﬁreplace (Botella et al., 1976). This ﬁreplace was
excavated at Level B (Corte 3) and was interpreted as a hearth
delimited by quarzite blocks that shape a discrete area and show
their internal faces burnt (Fig. 2). Such structure was plenty of
charcoal and contained small fragments of burnt bones. The earliest
evidence of intentional use of ﬁre in Europe is found at Beeches Pit,
England (beds 3b, 5, and 6), dated at MIS 11 (Gowlett et al., 2005;
Preece et al., 2006). Therefore, if the chronology suggested by
Scott and Gibert (2009) for SZ is correct, this would imply that the
oldest evidence of intentional use of ﬁre in Europe has an age of
>750 kyr, which is in disagreement with the chronologies currently
accepted (see review in Roebroeks and Villa, 2011). For this reason,
both the interpretation of the archaeological assemblage and the
evidence for ﬁre need to be taken into account in assessing the date
for SZ.
The large mammal assemblage of SZ, ﬁrst studied by MartínPenela (1988), is typical of the second half of the Middle Pleistocene in Mediterranean Europe (Table 1). In fact, most of the species
identiﬁed in the faunal assemblage from this site are not found
before Middle Pleistocene times and some of them (e.g., Canis lupus,
Stephanorhinus hemitoechus, and B. primigenius) are always found in

surface when the excavation of the site took place. The lower tool is a lanceolate

one of the sedimentary levels of SZ and is coherent with the lithic
industry of the site (i.e., tools developed on ﬂakes of Mousterian
appearance, typical of the archaic Middle Palaeolithic), it cannot be
conﬁdently dated by paleomagnetism because it was not found in

quartzite blocks with their internal face burnt.

list published by Scott and Gibert (2009: Table 1) e citing RuizBustos (1999a), who followed the taxonomy of Martín-Penela
(1988) e shows a number of changes in relation to the original
description of the mammalian assemblage. These changes in the
attribution of species, not justiﬁed by any critical reassessment of
their taxonomic afﬁnities, tend to make the assemblage older, in
agreement with the new age deduced from magnetostratigraphy:
for example, the Middle Pleistocene horse Equus caballus torralbae
(now E. ferus torralbae) and the wolf C. lupus are arbitrarily changed
to the Early Pleistocene Equus cf. sussenbornensis and Early Pleistocene to early Middle Pleistocene Canis mosbachensis, respectively.
As no explanation is given for these changes, it does seem that Scott
and Gibert (2009) amended the faunal identiﬁcations so that they
were consistent with the early Middle Pleistocene age deduced
from magnetic polarity.
The composition of the mammalian assemblage identiﬁed in SZ
(Table 1) is typical of the upper part of the Middle Pleistocene, above
the Mimomys savini biozone, with an age of w300 kyr (MartínPenela, 1988; Cerdeño, 1989; Ruiz-Bustos, 1997, 1999a, 2002; DíazHernández and Juliá, 2006). In addition, a study by Ruiz-Bustos
(1999b) of molar tooth size in Quaternary arvicolids showed that
the ﬁrst lower molar experienced a gradual increase in size
throughout the Pleistocene in the Arvicola cantiana e A. sapidus
lineage, which allowed him to deﬁne an equation that relates tooth
size to absolute age (Ruiz-Bustos,1999b: Fig. 3). This biochronological

index provided coherent age estimates for a number of Pleistocene
localities of the Betic Chains (e.g., 1.3 Myr for Venta Micena and
0.7 Myr for Cúllar Baza-1 in the Guadix-Baza basin, 0.9 Myr for Cueva
Victoria). The value obtained for SZ, 0.3 Myr (Ruiz-Bustos, 1999b:
Table 1), is in agreement with the late Middle Pleistocene age estimated for this site with the large mammal fauna and is also coherent
with the lithic industry of SZ in the archaic Middle Palaeolithic
context of Europe.
Scott and Gibert (2009) assume a stratigraphic continuity
between the levels of SZ, which is not deduced from the archaeological and paleontological evidence available. For example,
although there are lithic tools in Level A, no handaxe was found in it
(Botella et al., 1976). In addition, this is the only level in which
remains of elephant Mammuthus trogontherii were unearthed. In
the other levels, the species present is the straight-tusked Elephas
antiquus (Martín-Penela, 1988; Ros-Montoya, 2010). This opens an
interesting debate, as both proboscideans seem to have been
subject to competitive exclusion, alternating in cold and warm
periods, respectively (van der Made and Mazo, 2001), which would
indicate the discontinuity between Level A, the lowest of the
sequence, and Levels B, C, and D. A similar situation has been
described for other sites: for example, M trogontherii is found in the
Buenavista level of the alluvial terraces of the Tajo River in Toledo,
dated to w300 kyr, while E. antiquus is found in the Pinedo level,
which is something older (Aguirre, 1964, 1989; van der Made and
Mazo, 2001).

J.M. Jiménez-Arenas et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 38 (2011) 3340e3349

A similar scenario can be drawn for the other locality dated by
magnetostratigraphy, EQ: in this site, Scott and Gibert (2009) report
on the age of a single handaxe, which is considered to be w900 kyr,
thus well below the Matuyama/Brunhes reversal. However, it is
worth noting that the technological context of this handaxe has not
been published and both the stratigraphy of the site and the position of the tool are not precise enough (see below). Concerning the
faunal assemblage of EQ, Scott and Gibert (2009) indicate the
presence of the Etruscan rhino Stephanorhinus etruscus, which has
a Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene age, but the species that appears
in the original references for this site (Walker et al., 2006a, 2006b)
is the Middle Pleistocene species Stephanorhinus (Dicerorhinus) cf.
hemitoechus. Similarly, a number of Early Pleistocene taxa which
were not described previously in the faunal assemblage (e.g., the
horse Equus altidens, the small-to-medium sized wolf C. mosbachensis and the fallow deer Dama ‘nestii’ vallonnetensis) are cited
now by Scott and Gibert (2009). In contrast, the faunal list published for EQ includes the equid Equus cf. caballus and the wolf
Canis cf. lupus (Walker et al., 2006a, 2006b). In addition, skeletal
remains attributed to H. heidelbergensis, the Middle Pleistocene
hominin of Europe, have been found in the bone assemblage of EQ
(Walker et al., 2006b). Therefore, the chronology suggested by Scott
and Gibert (2009) would imply that this human species lived also
during the Early Pleistocene, thus coexisting with H. antecessor.
In contrast, Walker et al. (2006b) presented the site as consistently and convincingly early to mid-Middle Pleistocene, w500 kyr.
The faunal list of the site (Walker et al., 2006b: p. 9) comprises
Allophaiomys chalinei, Mimomys savini, Arvicola cf. deucalion, Pliomys episcopalis, Microtus brecciensis brecciensis, Terricola (Pitymys) huescarensis huescarensis, Allocricetus bursae, Apodemus
ﬂavicollis, cf. Apodemus aff. mystacinus, Prolagus calpensis, Lepus sp.,
Oryctolagus sp., Stephanorhinus (Dicerorhinus) hemitoechus, Megaloceros (Megaceros) cf. giganteus, Bison sp. and Macaca cf. sylvanus.
According to this fauna, Walker et al. (2006b: p. 26) argued that the
assemblage was likely Cromerian IV, possibly equivalent to MIS 11
or MIS 13. In spite of that, Scott and Gibert (2009: Table 1) cite
Walker et al. (2006b) as the source for their faunal list, in which
many species are omitted or arbitrarily changed to suit the paleomagnetic evidence (see Table 1). In addition, Walker et al. (2006b)
describe in great detail the tool assemblage of EQ as containing
Acheulean, Levallois and Mousterian artefacts, which is again
consistent with a mid-Middle Pleistocene age. For this reason, if the
discovery of three Levallois ﬂakes in EQ (Walker et al., 2006a,
2006b) situated below the level of the single Acheulean handaxe
dated by Scott and Gibert (2009) in w900 kyr is conﬁrmed, this
would also mean that the earliest production of Levallois debitage
in Western Europe took place at nearly twice the age commonly
accepted (Tryon et al., 2005; Moncel et al., 2011).
Finally, in a recent paper, Walker et al. (2010) change completely
their views on the dating of EQ, accepting without reservations the
paleomagnetic evidence provided by Scott and Gibert (2009): the
lithic assemblage is now seen as showing the ﬂexibility of early
Pleistocene hominins and the futility of imposing rigid typological
terms on artefact assemblages, the hominins have mutated into
H. heidelbergensis, the fauna has also changed into being late Early
Pleistocene, and the palynological record is interpreted as evidencing
warm moist environmental conditions, probably MIS 21 or MIS 25. In
fact, Walker et al. (2010) explicitly afﬁrm that biostratigraphy,
paleomagnetism and preliminary OSL estimates all point to a late
Early Pleistocene age, slightly before the Matuyama/Brunhes
boundary, for the deep sedimentary ﬁll excavated in the rock-shelter
from which the H. heidelbergensis teeth were unearthed. Consequently, Walker et al. (2010) introduce some changes in the faunal list
(e.g., S. hemitoechus becomes now S. etruscus), although they hold the
names of others (e.g., the equid is listed again as E. sussenbornesis, as in

3345

Walker et al. (2006b), not E. altidens, as in Scott and Gibert (2009)) and
there is no mention of C. mosbachensis and Dama ’nestii’ vallonnetensis,
both cited by Scott and Gibert (2009). The tool assemblage from the
deep levels of EQ is interpreted now by as showing “early” and
“middle” Palaeolithic characteristics. Speciﬁcally, Walker et al. (2010)
describe an Acheulean handaxe, ﬂaked bifacially on a ﬂat limestone
cobble, along with abundant small ﬂake tools on chert, limestone and
quartzite, some of which show steep abrupt (“Mousteroid”) edgeretouch and facetted striking platforms, struck by recurrent centripetal ﬂaking from small prepared (“Levallois”) discoidal cores,
including pointed triangular ﬂakes, sidescrapers, small carinated
scrapers, proto-limaces, awls, denticulates, notched forms and at least
one burin, as well as abundant knapping débris.
3. On the presence of Early Pleistocene human remains in
southern Spain
Scott and Gibert (2009: Table 1) also indicate the presence of
Homo sp. in three sites of Southeast Spain well calibrated magnetostratigraphically that are conﬁdently placed below the Jaramillo
Subchron. Two of these localities, Venta Micena (VM) and Barranco
León (BL) are situated in the Guadix-Baza Basin near the village of
Orce, with ages estimated by biostratigraphy as w1.5 and w1.3 Myr,
respectively (Oms et al., 2000; Palmqvist et al., 2005; MartínezNavarro et al., 2010a).
In VM, three fragmentary bone specimens (skull cap VM-0,
humeral diaphysis VM-1960 and distal humerus VM-3691) have
been attributed to the genus Homo (Gibert et al., 1989, 1998, 1999a;
Gibert and Palmqvist, 1995; Lowenstein et al., 1999). However, the
human afﬁnities of these fossils have been seriously questioned and
none of them is now accepted as unequivocally human (Palmqvist,
1997; Moyà-Solà and Köhler, 1997; Martínez-Navarro, 2002;
Palmqvist et al., 2005). In fact, the last anatomical study of VM0 concluded that this cranial fragment is part of the frontal bones
of a female ruminant without cranial appendages (MartínezNavarro, 2002) and for VM-1960 there are also reservations on its
human nature, because the longitudinal curvature and the shape of
proximal and distal sections of this diaphyseal shaft match the
anatomy of the unfused ulna of juvenile ruminants (Palmqvist et al.,
2005). In addition, Arribas and Palmqvist (2002) used a taphonomic approach based on the binomial distribution for estimating
as negligible the probability that a taxon of the size of an early
Homo could be represented in the large mammal assemblage of VM
(which includes >17 000 bones and teeth) by several bones and no
tooth remains.
In the case of BL, a small tooth fragment that preserves the
mesial part of the crown and root (BL-0) has been reported as an
upper human molar (Gibert et al., 1999b). However, there are
reservations on the stratigraphic position of the fossil and even on
its attribution to the genus Homo: in fact, it has been suggested that
it could belong to a deciduous tooth fragment of H. antiquus,
a species better represented in the faunal assemblage of this site, as
the bunodont teeth of hippos show a thick enamel layer that
matches the anatomy of BL-0 (Arribas and Palmqvist, 2002).
In the third locality, the karstic site of Cueva Victoria (w1.0 Myr),
placed near the city of Cartagena, three fossil bones have also been
attributed to the genus Homo. Two of them are poorly preserved
distal humeri (CV-1 and CV-2; Gibert et al., 2002) that are even less
anatomically convincing than specimens VM-1960 and VM-3691
cited above. The third fossil, CV-0, was initially published as
a complete medial phalanx of a human hand (Gibert and Pons-Moyà,
1985). However, although comparative anatomical, radiological and
morphometric analyses of this fossil seemed to conﬁrm the preliminary diagnosis (Gibert and Pérez-Pérez, 1989; Palmqvist et al., 1996;
Gibert et al., 2002), it was not compared to phalanges of T. oswaldi, an

3346

J.M. Jiménez-Arenas et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 38 (2011) 3340e3349

African immigrant in the Early Pleistocene of Europe (Rook et al.,
2004) that is also recorded at the site (Gibert et al., 1995). Subsequent comparative studies of the anatomy of CV-0 have shown that it
closely matches the foot phalanges of T. oswaldi, the only primate
species conﬁdently identiﬁed at Cueva Victoria (Martínez-Navarro
et al., 2005, 2008; but see also Gibert et al., 2008). In any case, it is
worth noting that this site lacks a well-deﬁned stratigraphy and most
of the fossil remains of Early Pleistocene mammals were found in
fallen blocks inside the karstic cavity.
Given the evidence discussed above, the only Early Pleistocene
localities in Western Europe with conclusively identiﬁed human
remains, apart from those of EQ, are the Atapuercan sites of Sima
del Elefante and TD-6, dated at w1.3e1.2 Myr (Carbonell et al.,
2008) and w0.9 Myr (Berger et al., 2008), respectively. Concerning EQ, the age estimated by paleomagnetism for this site implies
that H. heidelbergensis inhabited Spain in the Matuyama Chron,
which means that it would be the earliest H. heidelbergensis in both
Europe and Africa. This seems exceedingly unlikely, as there is no
indication of the presence of this species in the Atapuercan sites,
where >150 specimens have now been recovered of a hominin
most likely H. antecessor (Bermúdez de Castro et al., 1997, 2010;
Carbonell et al., 2008).
4. Is magnetostratigraphic dating possible without a good
geological and biostratigraphic control?
The arguments discussed above indicate that although magnetostratigraphy is a powerful tool for dating archaeological sites, the
ages estimated with this geochronological technique must be
calibrated using a well-deﬁned biostratigraphy, which was not
done in the study of Scott and Gibert (2009).
Scott and Gibert (2009: SI, p. 5) argue convincingly that a number
of European “Middle” Pleistocene sites eand their associated faunae
have only vaguely established ages, and that the biochronology for
the latter part of the Early Pleistocene and much of the Middle
Pleistocene will probably continue to be revised as more precise
chronologies are applied to dispersed sites and additional stratigraphic sequences are explored and calibrated. However, if we take
into consideration the information on the composition of the large
mammal assemblages from SZ and EQ (Martín-Penela, 1988; RuizBustos, 1999a, 1999b, 2002; Walker, 2006a, 2006b) together with
the interpretation of the magnetostratigraphy made by Scott and
Gibert (2009) for these sites, this would imply that the ﬁrst appearance in the European fossil record of E. caballus, S. hemitoechus, C.
lupus, B. primigenius and H. heidelbergensis would be in the Early
Pleistocene. It is worth noting that we do not argue here for the
priority of biostratigraphy over paleomagnetism, but on the
complementarity of both approaches.
It could be also argued, however, that the paleomagnetic
polarities measured by Scott and Gibert (2009) in SZ and EQ sites
(or in nearby, well correlated sections), which both show extensive
intervals of reversed polarity, are fully independent of the fossils
and tools contained within the strata and must be integrated into
the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS), in this case the last
global polarity change from Reverse to Normal at 0.78 Myr.
According to this reasoning, the ﬁnding of negative polarity in the
beds of these sites would necessarily imply a Matuyama age for
them, as this would be the youngest date possible.
However, a number of reversals of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld from
positive to negative polarity took place during the Brunhes Chron, as
detected in several studies of volcanic and deep marine sedimentary
sequences. Of these reversals, which may total up to 14 geomagnetic
episodes lasting 5e10 kyr each, six have been consistently recorded
and are now established as global phenomena by correlation
between different sites (Laj and Channell, 2007: Table 1 and

references listed therein). Given the extreme variability of the rates
of sedimentation in ﬂuvial, lacustrine and karstic environments
(Sadler, 1981), this opens up the possibility that in the two localities
the sediments sampled were deposited during one of the short
polarity reversals that took place during the Brunhes Chron. In such
a case, a younger chronology for the SZ and EQ sites would be in
better agreement with the age estimates provided by biostratigraphy (Botella et al., 1976; Martín-Penela, 1988; Walker et al., 2006a,
2006b; Ruiz-Bustos, 1999a, 1999b, 2002) and also with the chronology for the appearance of Acheulean industries in Western
Europe (Arribas and Palmqvist, 1999; Santonja and Villa, 2006;
Semaw et al., 2009; Santonja and Pérez-González, 2010). However,
given that the stratigraphic context of some of the paleomagnetic
samples from SZ is not well described and that the stratigraphic
column is a composite, which makes it difﬁcult to place the tools in
relation to the Brunhes/Matuyama polarity reversal, we must admit
that correlation with another reversal during the Brunhes Chron is
equally uncertain.
Compared to SZ, the situation for EQ is even more problematic
to deal with, because the paleomagnetic samples are consistently
reversed over several meters of deposit at this karst site. For this
reason, it is less likely that these readings record a short paleomagnetic excursion within the Brunhes Chron, as in the case of SZ.
It is worth noting, however, that the samples taken by Scott and
Gibert (2009: Fig. 1) come exclusively from toward the back of
the cave, and no additional samples were taken in the cave section
and the front part of the karst deposits. In this case, the error would
consist in assuming that the paleomagnetic evidence applies to the
entire site, which suggests another possible explanation for the
ﬁnding of reversed polarity: according to the information provided
by Walker et al. (2006b), the complex karst inﬁllings of EQ could
underwent two sedimentary cycles, the ﬁrst during late Matuyama
times (hence the reversed polarity). Following tectonic activity
(described in detail by Walker et al., 2006b), the cave was uplifted,
and most of its sediments were removed by erosion. The cave then
reﬁlled in the Middle Pleistocene, incorporating by these times the
faunal assemblage and lithic artefacts. According to this interpretation, these levels of the cave section would show a normal
polarity, consistent with the fauna and tools. Only new paleomagnetic analyses developed across the entire karst inﬁllings will
clarify this issue.
In summary, paleomagnetic proﬁles e and the absolute “dates”
measured from them e are not automatically correct and must be
properly integrated into the site stratigraphy. They are a line of
evidence that needs checking against over types of evidence (e.g.,
geological setting and biostratigraphy) on the likely age of a site.
5. Concluding remarks
Most archaeological and geochronological evidence indicates
that Acheulean handaxes appeared in the European record during
Middle Pleistocene times (w600 kyr), associated with remains of H.
heidelbergensis. In spite of this, Scott and Gibert (2009) suggested
a substantially older chronology for the earliest Acheulean of
Southeast Spain, based on paleomagnetic data for two archaeological localities, Solana del Zamborino (SZ) and Estrecho del Quípar (EQ). However, we have detected a number of errors in their
interpretation of the tool assemblage from the ﬁrst site as well as
severe discrepancies with the original faunal lists published for
both localities, with arbitrary changes of names for large mammal
species that tend to make the bone assemblages older, as expected
from their new age estimates. In addition, Scott and Gibert (2009)
indicate the presence of human remains in three Early Pleistocene sites of Southeast Spain that are well calibrated biostratigraphically and magnetostratigraphically, but where the human

J.M. Jiménez-Arenas et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 38 (2011) 3340e3349

afﬁnities of the fossils are far from being unanimously accepted.
Here we argue that the ﬁnding of reverse polarity in the sediments
sampled for paleomagnetism in SZ could merely reﬂect the fact that
they were deposited during one of the short polarity reversals that
took place during the Brunhes Chron. However, the use of
a composite stratigraphic column for paleomagnetic sampling
precludes correlating this reversal with a particular event. In the
case of EQ the situation is more complex, but there is the possibility
that the faunal assemblage and lithic artefacts do not correspond to
the Early Pleistocene inﬁllings but were incorporated later, during
a second sedimentary cycle in the Middle Pleistocene. Such interpretations would result in younger chronologies for these sites,
which is in better agreement with the ages estimated by biostratigraphy and also with the currently accepted chronology of the
ﬁrst Acheulean tools in Europe.
