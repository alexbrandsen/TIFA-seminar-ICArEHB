Iron Age (c. 700 BCe43AD) funerary practice has long been a focus of debate in British archaeology.
Formal cemeteries are rare and in central-southern Britain human remains are often unearthed in unusual conﬁgurations. They are frequently recovered as isolated fragments, partially articulated body parts
or complete skeletons in atypical contexts, often storage pits. In recent years, taphonomic analysis of
remains has been more frequently employed to elucidate depositional practice (e.g. Madgwick, 2008,
2010; Redfern, 2008). This has enhanced our understanding of modes of treatment and has contributed
much-needed primary data to the discussion. However, only macroscopic taphonomic analysis has been
undertaken and equiﬁnality (i.e. different processes producing the same end result) remains a substantial
obstacle to interpretation. This research explores the potential of novel microscopic (histological)
methods of taphonomic analysis for providing greater detail on the treatment of human remains in Iron
Age Britain. Twenty human bones from two Iron Age sites: Danebury and Suddern Farm, in Hampshire,
central-southern Britain were examined and assessed using thin section light microscopy combined with
the Oxford Histological Index (OHI). Results suggest that diverse mortuary rites were practised and that
different conﬁgurations of remains were subject to prescribed, varied treatment, rather than resulting
from different stages of the same process. Practices that may be responsible for these patterns include
exhumation followed by selective removal of elements and sheltered exposure prior to ﬁnal burial. Only
one sample provided evidence for excarnation, a practice that has been widely cited as a potential
majority rite in Iron Age Britain.

1. Introduction
Variation in the character of human remains recovered from
British Iron Age sites suggests that the dead were subject to a
diverse range of mortuary rites (Whimster, 1977, 1981; Wait, 1985;
Cunliffe, 1988; Stead, 1991; Darvill, 2010). Unburnt human bones
are most often recovered in varying states of articulation from
storage pits and other non-funerary features within settlements
and hillforts and rarely from discrete burial grounds (Whimster,
1981; Wait, 1985; Stead, 1991; Darvill, 2010). Formal cemeteries
are largely absent from central-southern Britain, an area that
clearly sustained a substantial population, with widespread settlement and relatively intensive agricultural production during the
Iron Age (Sharples, 2010). The numbers of human remains can only

account for a fraction of the individuals that occupied these sites,
and it is likely that the practices represented do not reﬂect the rites
afforded to the majority of the dead, which may not have left an
archaeological record (Wait, 1985; Bradbury et al., 2016). Wait
(1985: 90) suggested that an archaeologically visible rite was
practised for only 6% of individuals in the early/middle Iron Age.
The diverse, fragmentary and limited evidence for funerary ritual in
Iron Age Britain has led to considerable debate on the majority rite
and the modes of treatment for the minority that are represented
archaeologically (Ellison and Drewett, 1971; Wilson, 1981; Wait,
1985; Hill, 1995; Carr and Knüsel, 1997; Craig et al., 2005; Carr,
2007; Madgwick, 2008; Tracey, 2012).
Excarnation through sub-aerial exposure, followed by disturbance and selective retrieval of skeletal elements represents the
dominant interpretation of disarticulated and partially-articulated
human bones (Stead, 1991; Carr and Knüsel, 1997; Craig et al.,
2005; Knüsel and Outram, 2006; Redfern, 2008; Darvill, 2010). In
strict terminology, excarnation refers to ﬂesh removal (by any

means) but throughout this article it refers speciﬁcally to ﬂesh
removal through sub-aerial exposure, as is generally the case in
archaeological literature. Excarnation might account for the dearth
of human bones and may therefore have been the majority rite, as
the weathering promoted by prolonged exposure would eventually
destroy all physical remains (Redfern, 2008). Disposal in aqueous
environments has been suggested as an alternative explanation for
the majority rite (Madgwick, 2008; Sharples, 2010: 272). Analysis of
surface modiﬁcations in Iron Age human bones from Danebury
hillfort and Winnall Down enclosure in Hampshire indicates that
the human assemblage was unlikely to have been produced by subaerial exposure (Madgwick, 2008). The sparse surface modiﬁcation
of the human bones suggests that they had not been exposed for
long periods. However, small numbers of modiﬁed bones at
Gussage-all-Saints and Maiden Castle, Dorset, have been taken as
evidence for excarnation (Redfern, 2008). In both cases there is
evidence that bodies decomposed in a primary depositional environment before selected skeletal elements or body parts were
moved to a new context (secondary deposition). Whether excarnated or not, there is clear evidence for formalized treatment of
human remains, as part of a suite of prescribed depositional practices (Hill, 1995; Madgwick, 2010; Sharples, 2010).
Labile skeletal elements, such as those of the hands and feet,
disarticulate rapidly during bodily decomposition. Therefore, most
skeletons recovered in complete anatomical articulation, can be
assumed to represent bodies that were buried soon after death and
not subject to post-depositional disturbance (Duday, 2006). A far
broader range of processes may have been involved in the production of disarticulated or partially articulated human bone assemblages
(e.g.
excarnation,
exhumation,
disturbance,
cannibalism). Speciﬁc taphonomic methods of analysis such as
bone surface modiﬁcation and skeletal part representation have
been used to discriminate between different formation mechanisms, but they provide only a limited suite of information (see Carr
and Knüsel, 1997; Craig et al., 2005; Knüsel and Outram, 2006;
Redfern, 2008; Madgwick, 2008, 2010). Therefore there is still
considerable uncertainty regarding the speciﬁc funerary rites
practised by British Iron Age populations, as well as the degree of
variability in practices within and between sites.
Understanding of Iron Age burial practices has been complicated
by issues of equiﬁnality. Therefore new lines of enquiry are required
to improve interpretative resolution.
1.1. Taphonomic analysis of bone microstructure
Microscopic analysis of taphonomic modiﬁcations of bone
microstructure has substantial potential for providing greater detail
on the depositional treatment of remains and no research on British
Iron Age populations has yet been published. Microscopic bioerosion, consisting of ‘micro-foci of destruction’ (MFD), is the most
common form of diagenesis found in archaeological bone (Hackett,
1981; Turner-Walker et al., 2002). Three types of MFD (linear longitudinal, budded and lamellate) are associated with bacteria and
represent the predominant form of bioerosion (Hackett, 1981;
Balzer et al., 1997; Jackes et al., 2001; Turner-Walker et al., 2002).
A fourth type of MFD, Wedl tunneling, relates to fungal attack from
external sources in the depositional environment (Marchiafava
ndez-Jalvo et al., 2010).
et al., 1974; Hackett, 1981; Ferna
The preservation of the internal bone microstructure does not
correspond with the external condition of the bone and represents
a distinct source of taphonomic information (Hedges et al., 1995;
Hedges, 2002; Jans et al., 2004). Experimental studies of bacterial
bioerosion in bone have suggested that it is an early taphonomic
process, mostly conﬁned to the ﬁrst decade after death (Bell et al.,
1996; Boaks et al., 2014; White and Booth, 2014). The extent of

15

bacterial tunneling is unrelated to the chronological age of an
archaeological bone and the diagenetic signature of early postmortem bioerosion persists through deep time in environments
where bone preserves (Hedges et al., 1995; Hedges, 2002; Jans et al.,
2004; Turner-Walker, 2012). Microscopic analyses of ancient bone
diagenesis have proven useful in discriminating between bones
with variable taphonomic histories (Turner-Walker and Jans, 2008;
Hollund et al., 2012; van der Sluis et al., 2014). However, microscopic methods have rarely been used to address questions surrounding funerary treatment (Parker Pearson et al., 2005).
Efforts to determine the speciﬁc processes that control bioerosion have been hampered by inexplicable variation in bacterial
attack, particularly within and between skeletal elements (Hanson
and Buikstra, 1987; Nicholson, 1996; Nielsen-Marsh and Hedges,
2000; Jans et al., 2004). This variation is still not properly understood, but evidence suggests it relates to differences in ratios of
cortical and trabecular bone within and between skeletal elements
(Hanson and Buikstra, 1987; Jans et al., 2004; Booth, 2014). Variation in bioerosion within archaeological bones from burial contexts
that inhibit bacterial activity (e.g. anoxic or waterlogged sediments)
will reﬂect environmental ﬂuctuations rather than speciﬁc mortuary events (Turner-Walker and Jans, 2008; Hollund et al., 2012;
van der Sluis et al., 2014). However, outside of these speciﬁc environments, the appearance and severity of bacterial bioerosion in
archaeological and modern bone has been broadly linked to early
taphonomic events. For instance, butchered archaeological bone is
often free from bacterial bioerosion, whereas bone from complete
articulated skeletons has usually been extensively tunneled by
bacteria (Jans et al., 2004; Nielsen-Marsh et al., 2007; White and
Booth, 2014; Booth, 2015). Several large-scale studies focused
mainly on archaeological long bone shafts have replicated these
results, suggesting that there is usually no signiﬁcant variation in
bioerosion within compact diaphyseal bone of the same element
(Jans et al., 2004; Nielsen-Marsh et al., 2007; Booth, 2014, 2015).
Micro-CT scans of archaeological infant human remains produced
by one of the authors (Booth, in prep) show that the extent of
bacterial bioerosion does not vary signiﬁcantly across femoral
diaphyses.
Bones from modern excarnated corpses exhibit limited or no
ndez-Jalvo et al., 2010;
bacterial tunneling (Bell et al., 1996; Ferna
White and Booth, 2014). These ﬁndings indicate that bacterial
attack in archaeological bone will reﬂect processes that affect the
degree of early bacterial soft tissue decomposition. Butchered
bones would have been exposed to little, if any, soft tissue
decomposition. Excarnated bodies are rapidly skeletonised by
vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers within a few months,
limiting bone exposure to soft tissue putrefaction. Burial protects
the body from rapid skeletonisation, ensuring the bones are subject
to prolonged bacterial attack over a number of years (Rodriguez and
Bass, 1983, 1985; Bell et al., 1996; Campobasso et al., 2001; Dent
et al., 2004; Vass, 2011).
This link between bone bioerosion and soft tissue decomposition provides strong evidence that non-Wedl MFD are produced by
an organism's enteric gut microbiota. These bacteria transmigrate
around a cadaver in the ﬁrst few days after death and go on to
permeate the bone microstructure (Child, 1995a, 1995b; Gill-King,
1997; White and Booth, 2014). They are largely responsible for
the early putrefaction stage of soft tissue decomposition (Child,
1995b; Bell et al., 1996; Gill-King, 1997). Recent studies of modern
and archaeological bone have established that putrefactive bacteria
are a principal cause of non-Wedl MFD (Jans et al., 2004; NielsenMarsh et al., 2007; Boaks et al., 2014; White and Booth, 2014).
There is still debate on the role of soil bacteria, which may produce
similar patterns of bioerosion (Turner-Walker, 2012), but a growing
body of evidence supports the dominant impact of endogenous gut

16

bacteria (Bell et al., 1996; Jans et al., 2004; Guarino et al., 2006;
Nielsen-Marsh et al., 2007; Boaks et al., 2014; White and Booth,
2014).
Most European archaeological bones retrieved as part of complete inhumed skeletons demonstrate extensive bacterial bioerosion, as the majority rite of immediate burial over the last two
millennia (Jans et al., 2004; Nielsen-Marsh et al., 2007; White and
Booth, 2014; Booth, 2015). Although climate and seasonality impact
on soft tissue decomposition, evidence indicates that they do not
substantially affect bone bioerosion in temperate environments
(Campobasso et al., 2001; Vass, 2011; Booth, 2015). Variation in
bacterial attack is therefore generally best explained by different
modes of pre-depositional treatment and consequently histological
preservation is useful for detecting divergent taphonomic trajectories related to early bodily decomposition (Nielsen-Marsh et al.,
2007; Hollund et al., 2012; van der Sluis et al., 2014; Booth, 2015).
This study explores the potential of assessing microscopic diagenesis of human bone alongside macroscopic taphonomic evidence to
reconstruct mortuary practice in a sample of individuals from the
British Iron Age sites of Danebury and Suddern Farm, Hampshire,
UK. This study was designed to address the following questions:
Can variation in bone bioerosion be observed that is best
explained by differential post-mortem treatment?
How many separate mortuary practices appear to be represented when the results are combined with accompanying taphonomic information?
Is it possible to interpret the results alongside other taphonomic
analyses to make inferences about speciﬁc treatment of the dead at
these sites?
2. Materials and methods
2.1. The sites
The Danebury assemblage was an ideal choice for the current
study as the conﬁgurations and contexts of the human remains
were typical of southern British Iron Age settlement sites and have
been suggested to reﬂect variable forms of mortuary treatment
(Cunliffe, 1984). In addition, one of the authors (RM) had previously
performed extensive macroscopic taphonomic analysis of this
assemblage, providing a useful complementary dataset. Human
remains from Suddern Farm were included in the study, as they
formed part of the same collection and might add to the potential
variation in post-mortem treatment. These burials may represent a
different funerary practice from individuals from Danebury, as they
were recovered from a more formal inhumation cemetery (Cunliffe
and Poole, 2000).
Danebury is the most comprehensively excavated hillfort in
Britain and is located near Nether Wallop, Hampshire (Fig. 1). The
main excavations were conducted by Cunliffe (1984, 1991) between
1969 and 1988. The hillfort consisted of a 5 ha settlement surrounded by ramparts and ditches. It was occupied from approximately 550 BC. and largely abandoned around 100 BC.
Over 300 deposits of human remains have been recovered from
Danebury (see Walker, 1984; Cunliffe and Poole, 2000; Sharples,
2010; after Cunliffe, 1995). These were recovered in various states
of articulation as part of single and multiple burials from various
features dispersed around the settlement (Walker, 1984: 443).
Human remains were associated with all phases of activity,
although most dated to the later periods of occupation (Walker,
1984: 457). Much of the human bone had been deposited on top
of a mixture of domestic refuse and chalk silt. Some of the bones
were covered by a layer of natural silt, which suggested that pits
had been left open whilst bodies decomposed (Walker, 1984: 448).
The frequency of discrete depositions of crania and the common

absence of the cranium from partially-articulated skeletons suggests selective retrieval and redeposition of this element (Walker,
1984: 164). The absence of cut mark evidence indicates that crania are likely to have been disarticulated through natural
decomposition.
Suddern Farm is an Iron Age settlement located around 5 km to
the west of Danebury. The site consisted of a medium-sized double
or treble-ditched enclosure of 2.2 ha (Cunliffe and Poole, 2000). It
was excavated in 1991 and 1996 as part of the Danebury Environs
Project. Ceramic evidence indicated that the site was contemporaneous with Danebury. Excavation of a three-ditch linear earthwork identiﬁed to the southwest of the enclosure located a quarry
that had been used as a cemetery from the Early to Middle Iron Age
(c.700e100 BC). Human remains representing a minimum of 60
individuals were recovered (Hooper, 1984), but it is estimated that
several hundred further burials are present in the quarry (Cunliffe
and Poole, 2000). In contrast to Danebury, these remains were
recovered from graves (or quarry pits) dug directly into the chalk
rubble and silt, rather than from storage pits and ditches. This
represents a rare example of something analogous to a formal
cemetery in Wessex (outside of the Durotrigian cemeteries of
Dorset, Fitzpatrick, 1997).
The skeletons from the Suddern Farm cemetery were recovered
in various stages of articulation and were often accompanied by
partial remains of several individuals (Cunliffe and Poole, 2000:
166). Excavation showed that grave cuts did not respect previous
interments and the absence of crania indicated selective removal
post-decomposition. Accumulations of natural silts within some
graves suggest that they had been left open whilst bodies decomposed. Cunliffe and Poole (2000: 168) proposed that the individuals
recovered from Suddern Farm had been buried complete and,
subsequently, some had become partially disarticulated through
disturbance by later grave-digging. By contrast, human remains
from Danebury were interpreted as having been excarnated in open
pits before body parts were selectively removed and buried.
However, these interpretations are based on limited evidence and
comparison of bacterial bioerosion has the potential to improve
resolution.
2.2. Samples
Twenty human bones were sampled at Hampshire Museums
Service collections in Winchester, UK. Skeletal element was
controlled where possible. The femur is the most commonlysampled element in studies of archaeological bone diagenesis as
it survives well, is mostly composed of compact bone and is the
closest long bone to the gut, which may mean that it is more sensitive to the activity of putrefactive bacteria (Jans et al. 2004).
Femoral midshafts were sampled preferentially for the current
study for these reasons and in order to produce comparable results
(Nielsen-Marsh and Hedges, 2000; Jans et al., 2004; Hollund et al.,
2012). The extent of bacterial bioerosion is usually consistent along
femoral shafts (Booth, in prep). Sampling targeted remains that
exhibited variable patterns of anatomical articulation on recovery
(e.g. disarticulated elements, complete articulated skeletons,
partially articulated parts of skeletons). These conﬁgurations of
bones potentially signiﬁed diverse post-mortem processes and
sampling across these categories represented an attempt to capture
variation in post-mortem treatment. Danebury human bone deposits were classiﬁed into three categories: complete articulated
skeletons, partially articulated deposits and discrete disarticulated
bones.
Six bones from each category were chosen for sampling. One of
the disarticulated bones could not be located and no equivalent
remains were available, therefore a bone from an additional

partially articulated skeleton was taken instead. The Suddern Farm
skeletons were considered as a discrete category of post-mortem
treatment. Two partially articulated skeletons were sampled from
Suddern Farm. Sampling only two skeletons from the site cannot be
considered representative and provides a very limited window into
practices and potential variation with the Danebury deposits.
However, histological data can at least hint at the potential for
further research.
Left femoral midshafts were sampled preferentially to ensure
that each sample represented a discrete individual. Right femora
were occasionally sampled (e.g. when they had already been drilled
for isotope analysis) but only from complete individuals or partially
articulated remains when the antimere was present, with one
exception. This disarticulated femur was checked against other
selected left femora to ensure that none of the individuals had been
sampled more than once. In addition, femora were unexpectedly
absent from one deposit and therefore the left tibia was sampled
and patterns of modiﬁcation were carefully scrutinized to ensure
results did not relate to inter-element variation. Long bone midshafts were sampled in all cases. It was beyond the scope of this
study to address chronological variation in histological results. The
majority of sampled bones dated to the middle and later ceramic
phases (>5; the Middle and Late Iron Age). Details of the samples
are provided in Table 1.
2.3. Thin section light microscopy
Samples (c. 1 cm by 1 cm) were cut from the mid-section of each
long bone diaphysis using a Foredom K.1070 rotary saw. Transverse
thin sections 50e120 microns thick were cut from these samples,
without the application of an embedding agent, using a Leica 1600
diamond saw microtome. Each undecalciﬁed and unstained thin
section was mounted onto a glass slide using Entellan mounting
medium and glass cover slip (Merck Chemicals). All thin sections
were analyzed under normal and polarized light at 25, 40 and 100
times magniﬁcation using transmitted light binocular microscopes
ﬁtted with polarizing ﬁlters. All digital micrographs of bone thin
sections were produced using an eye-piece mounted Lumera

inﬁnity digital microscopy camera in conjunction with Lumera Inﬁnity Capture and Analyze software. Samples were also viewed
using a polarizing ﬁlter to assess birefringence of adjacent lamellae,
as an indicator of collagen loss (Hackett, 1981).
Bioerosion was assessed using the Oxford Histological Index
(OHI) (Hedges et al., 1995; Millard, 2001). The OHI translates the
percentage of remaining unaltered bone microstructure into an
ordinal grade from 0 to 5, representing the worst and best preserved microstructure respectively. The OHI is subjective but has
proven effective in numerous previous studies of bioerosion. Interobserver testing of the OHI by Hedges et al. (1995: 203) found that
deviations in OHI score were insigniﬁcant and repeat assessments
never differed by more than one unit. Microstructural studies of
archaeological bone which have utilized several diagenetic parameters have consistently found that the OHI correlates with
quantitative parameters of decomposition such as collagen content
se et al., 2010;
and preservation of DNA (Ottoni et al., 2009; Devie
Sosa et al., 2013). The deposit number was written on each slide
to identify the thin section, but other information, such as level of
articulation, was not made available during histological
assessment.
3. Results
Results of the histological analysis are presented in Fig. 2 and
Table 2 and selected micrographs are presented in Figs. 3 and 4. All
of the bone samples from Danebury and Suddern Farm exhibited
destructive tunneling consistent with non-Wedl MFD (Table 2).
This tunneling accounted for all signiﬁcant variation in OHI scores.
Histological preservation across the whole sample set was quite
poor, but the extent of bacterial bioerosion was variable amongst
lower OHI scores (Fig. 2). Four partially-articulated/articulated
samples exhibited minor Wedl-type tunneling in areas of microstructure that were unaffected by bacterial attack. Wedl tunneling
had never progressed to an extent where it affected OHI scores. The
modal OHI score of the assemblage was 2, although there was also a
notable peak at 0 (Fig. 4). A single anomalously well-preserved
sample (sample 107, OHI ¼ 5) exhibited only limited bacterial

chronology).

and one both gnawed and weathered. In addition, one of the
samples had suffered substantial subterranean erosion and therefore other modiﬁcations may have been overprinted. The two peaks
at OHI scores of 2 and 0 were differentiated by articulation pattern,
with most samples scoring 0 being disarticulated and all those
scoring 2 being articulated/partially articulated (Fig. 2). Sample 107
was exceptional in the presence of severe cortical weathering
(Behrensmeyer (1978) stage 2), and its unusually high OHI score
further differentiated it from the rest of the sample set. The difference in OHI scores between the articulated/partially articulated
and disarticulated bones was signiﬁcant at 90% conﬁdence (n ¼ 20,
ManneWhitney U ¼ 19.00, p ¼ 0.090) and became signiﬁcant at
95% conﬁdence when the anomalous sample 107 was excluded
(n ¼ 19, ManneWhitney U ¼ 4.000, p ¼ 0.006).
Loss of collagen birefringence in the majority of samples was
associated with bioerosion. Sample 107 demonstrated reduced
levels of collagen birefringence that was not associated with bacterial tunneling (Fig. 6). This sample alone also demonstrated
consistent yellow discoloration. Intense microstructural staining
can obscure bone microstructure and reduce collagen birefringence
(Garland, 1987; Grupe and Dreses-Werringloer, 1993). However, the
staining in the thin section of sample 107 was too weak to be
responsible for the loss of birefringence. Collagen must have been
lost from this bone via a non-biological mechanism for low levels of
birefringence to be associated with well-preserved microstructure

4. Discussion
Environmental conditions that inhibit bodily decomposition
(e.g. waterlogging, anoxic or arid contexts) can inﬂuence bacterial
bioerosion (Turner and Wiltshire, 1999; Turner-Walker and Jans,
2008; Hollund et al., 2012; Booth, 2015), but there was no evidence
for these conditions in the free-draining Hampshire chalkland.
Considerable variation in bacterial attack was observed in the
Danebury and Suddern Farm samples, despite all having originated
from similar sedimentary matrices and some having come from the
same context (Cunliffe, 1984; Cunliffe and Poole, 2000, Table 2). In
common with previous studies, there was no evidence that variation in bacterial bioerosion was dictated by speciﬁc environmental
factors (Jans et al., 2004; Nielsen-Marsh et al., 2007). Therefore
variation is interpreted as resulting from patterns of mortuary
treatment.
The OHI scores of the Danebury and Suddern Farm bone samples suggest that they had been exposed to variable levels of
decomposition relating to their extent of articulation. At least three
taphonomic trajectories are represented by articulated/partially
articulated remains, isolated disarticulated skeletal elements and
sample 107. Results suggest that each sub-sample represents a
different form of funerary treatment, rather than all bones deriving
from disturbed partially articulated/articulated deposits, as has
been previously suggested (see Stanford, 1974: 220; Dunning, 1976:
116e117; Carr and Knüsel, 1997: 170). The exclusive appearance of
Wedl tunneling in articulated/partially articulated bone and the
non-biotic loss of collagen from sample 107 is also consistent in
these sub-samples having divergent taphonomic histories. At a
basic level therefore, the results of the histological analysis,
considered alongside the accompanying taphonomic information
suggest that the human remains deposited at Danebury had been
subject to diverse funerary practices which produced distinctive
patterns of articulation and microstructural bioerosion.
The associations between bacterial bioerosion and early postmortem treatment represent central tendencies rather than absolutes. Therefore interpretations of processes responsible for the
variation in bioerosion and skeletal articulation will be coupled
with a degree of uncertainty. However, combining histological
analysis with other taphonomic indices has the potential to

disentangle some issues of equiﬁnality in light of models of how
bodies decompose under different circumstances. In discussing
possible mortuary scenarios, equiﬁnality remains a problem and
consequently multiple interpretations must be considered. In short,
whilst precise practices are very difﬁcult to reconstruct with conﬁdence, possible rites can be identiﬁed and others can be eliminated, thus improving the resolution with which Iron Age funerary
practice is understood.
Histological preservation of disarticulated bone, with the
exception of sample 107, was poor. This is somewhat surprising, as
such poorly preserved histology is most often characteristic of fully
articulated inhumed burials (Jans et al., 2004; Nielsen-Marsh et al.,
2007). Partially articulated and disarticulated remains have previously been interpreted as evidence for excarnation (Ellison and
Drewett, 1971; Carr and Knüsel, 1997; Cunliffe et al., 2015) and
protected decomposition in either mortuary houses or subterranean environments (Madgwick, 2008). Excarnation is an unlikely
scenario, as the rapid soft tissue degradation associated with this
treatment substantially inhibits bacterial attack and seasonal variation in insect-mediated soft tissue loss could not account for differences (see Rodriguez and Bass, 1983, 1985; Campobasso et al.,
2001; Fern
andez-Jalvo et al., 2010; Vass, 2011). This result is
consistent with previous macroscopic analyses, which revealed
only sparse modiﬁcation evidence on disarticulated remains, also
inconsistent with excarnation (Madgwick, 2008). However, some
samples showed evidence of gnawing and weathering, indicative of
some sub-aerial exposure, but this could have occurred at any point
in the bones' taphonomic histories. Decomposition in mortuary
houses is an unlikely explanation, as whilst structures can delay
rapid soft tissue loss mediated by invertebrates, rates of skeletonisation in these types of environments are still more similar to
those promoted by excarnation and would probably still be too
rapid for putrefactive bacteria to completely degrade the histological bone structure (see Goff, 1991; Anderson, 2011). Bacterial
bioerosion in the disarticulated samples is most consistent with
primary burial of ﬂeshed individuals and disinterment after the
body had decomposed (see Nielsen-Marsh et al., 2007; Booth,
2015). For such poor preservation of the histological structure to
be observed, the bodies must have been buried for several years
prior to re-opening for the extraction of speciﬁc elements. Some
remains may have then become accessible to scavengers and agents
of weathering prior to incorporation into their ﬁnal depositional

setting.
The modal OHI score for the partially articulated/articulated
samples was 2. This is atypical for archaeological human bone and
inconsistent with exposure to extensive putrefaction associated
with immediate burial (Jans et al., 2004; Nielsen-Marsh et al., 2007;
White and Booth, 2014). This result is also inconsistent with minor
levels of bioerosion associated with excarnation (Bell et al., 1996;
ndez-Jalvo et al., 2010; White and Booth, 2014). Results sugFerna
gest more gradual exogenous degradation of soft tissue than would
occur during excarnation, but more rapid than would occur if
immediately buried. Although extensive experimental research has
been undertaken on histological modiﬁcation, none of the studies
provides the range of scenarios of mortuary treatment that may
have been employed in the Iron Age. However, the corpus of
experimental data means that suggestions can be made concerning
pre-depositional practices, which may be responsible for this
pattern of evidence.
The histological preservation combined with lack of evidence
for cut marks suggests partial disarticulation occurred through

bodies being left to decompose within depositional environments,
which reduced, but did not wholly prevent rapid soft tissue loss
through insect activity. Depositional environments which promote
this approximate pattern of decomposition include sheltered contexts such as structures or caves (Goff, 1991; Terrell-Nield and
MacDonald, 1997; Anderson, 2011). Similar patterns of bioerosion
were observed within Neolithic human remains that were most
likely deposited as ﬂeshed corpses in caves and megalithic monuments (Booth, 2015). The diagenetic signature of the articulated/
partially articulated remains is therefore potentially consistent
with primary deposition in a mortuary house. However, the
completeness of some of these skeletons precludes secondary
deposition, as this would cause considerable disarticulation.
As most of the partially articulated/articulated remains were in a
good state of completeness, it is likely that they were recovered
from their primary depositional context and therefore the best
explanation is that bodies degraded in a state of partial exposure,

potentially in open, silting pits. This scenario is consistent with
evidence for silt accumulation on burials at both sites (Cunliffe,
1984; Cunliffe and Poole, 2000) and in situ exposure has also
been suggested by Tracey (2012). Bodies exposed in pits would still
have been subject to relatively rapid skeletonisation by insects but
the increased protection of a deep, steep-sided silting pit (Fig. 7)
would reduce the speed of soft tissue loss, allowing bioerosion to
commence, but not progress to completion. Exposure in a silting pit
might also explain the very low levels of modiﬁcation on the
sampled remains and those that have been observed on a wider
sample of human remains from Danebury (Madgwick, 2008, 2010),
as weathering would be slow to progress and the bones would not
be accessible to scavengers. Only a single partially articulated
sample exhibited minor evidence of gnawing. Sub-aerial exposure
of bodies in pits, followed in some cases by selective retrieval of
body parts and burial before complete decomposition, provides a
plausible explanation for the patterns of microscopic and macroscopic preservation observed in the articulated/partially articulated

samples.
The degree of shelter required to promote considerable, but not
complete levels of bacterial attack, is open to debate. Although
silting pits would prevent scavenger disturbance and reduce the
degrading effects of full exposure to the elements, remains would
still be subject to attack from skeletonising insects. Therefore for
bacterial attack to progress to OHI scores centering on 2, pits may
have been prepared in a way that afforded remains some level of
protection from insects, causing more prolonged bacterial soft tissue decomposition. For patterns of relatively extensive bacterial
bioerosion, it may have been necessary for pits to have been
covered, perhaps with textile or leather whilst the bodies decomposed. The severity of bacterial bioerosion would have been
controlled by the efﬁcacy of the coverings in reducing invertebrate
access (see Bell et al., 1996; Terrell-Nield and MacDonald, 1997; Jans
et al., 2004; Simmons et al., 2010). Heavy wrapping of bodies in
clothing or textiles may present an alternative possible scenario,
however in forensic examples the effect of clothing and wrapping
on bodily decomposition is often variable and contradictory (Goff,
1991; Vass, 2011; Campobasso et al. 2001; Ferreira and Cunha,
2013). In the absence of directly relevant experimental research,
it is not possible to establish whether deposition in covered pits or
exposed, silting pits is most likely to be responsible for patterns of
bioerosion. Equiﬁnality remains a substantial hurdle to interpretation and determining precise practices is beyond the limits of the
data. However, both practices have clear similarities in terms of
mortuary treatment.
Wedl MFD, which was common on partially articulated/articulated remains has been linked to invasion by exogenous saprophytic fungi. A large-scale study of European archaeological human
bone (N ¼ 250) found that 8% of human samples were affected by
Wedl tunneling (Jans et al., 2004). The rate of Wedl tunneling
amongst the samples (25%) used in the current study is comparatively high. Fungal bioerosion has been observed to be more common in faunal remains (42% rate) and may be linked with the
deposition of partially-ﬂeshed bone in a well-aerated environment
(Marchiafava et al., 1974; Jans et al., 2004). The high rate of Wedl

22

T.J. Booth, R. Madgwick / Journal of Archaeological Science 67 (2016) 14e24

tunneling amongst the articulated/partially articulated samples
from Danebury and Suddern Farm is inconsistent with immediate
burial and emphasizes their taphonomic divergence from the disarticulated bones (Jans et al., 2004). Deposition in rapidly-silting
pits would have maintained an accessible, aerated environment
more conducive to fungal growth than a standard grave
(Marchiafava et al., 1974; Terrell-Nield and MacDonald, 1997).
However, the conditions that promote fungal bioerosion are poorly
understood, and the extent to which Wedl tunneling can support
interpretations of early post-mortem treatment is questionable.
The minimal bacterial bioerosion observed in sample 107 contrasted with the extensive tunneling recorded in the rest of the
sample set. The accompanying evidence for unique discoloration
and non-biotic loss of collagen within sample 107 provided further
evidence for its divergent taphonomic history. This histological
signature is consistent with sub-aerial exposure (see Bell et al.,
1996; Turner-Walker and Jans, 2008; Fern
andez-Jalvo et al., 2010;
White and Booth, 2014). This would also explain the disarticulated
state of the remains and the heavily weathered and carnivoregnawed cortex. The extensive weathering of the femur (to stage
2, following Behrensmeyer, 1978) suggests that the bone had
remained above ground for a substantial length of time prior to
ﬁnal deposition.
The Danebury skeletal catalogue stated that sample 107
demonstrated macroscopic signs of burning (Cunliffe, 1984). Reassessment of this femoral fragment found that the evidence for
burning was ambiguous and that discoloration could have been
caused by mould staining and/or mineral inﬁltration. The extent
and regularity of the microscopic discoloration in this sample is
inconsistent with inﬁltration by extraneous elements from the soil
and resembles changes associated with low-level heat treatment
(cf. Shahack-Gross et al., 1997; Hanson and Cain, 2007; Squires
et al., 2011). The loss of birefringence in this thin section indicated non-biotic collagen loss, which is most often attributed to
circumstances that accelerate hydrolytic reactions (Smith et al.,
2002, 2007). Loss of collagen via accelerated hydrolysis is consistent with low level heating (Hackett, 1981; Smith et al., 2002, 2007;
Abdel-Maksoud, 2010). However, accelerated hydrolysis and
discoloration of the bone microstructure could have also been
caused by extreme weathering promoted by prolonged sub-aerial
exposure (Smith et al., 2002, 2007).
These results suggest that the individual represented by sample
107 had been afforded a different form of post-mortem treatment
from other sampled individuals. This bone had most likely been
weathered substantially after the body was excarnated, although
the application of some form of heat treatment to smoke or dry the
bone cannot be entirely ruled out. Previous suggestions that a
predominant Iron Age practice of excarnation was responsible for
the dearth of human remains suggests that sample 107 may
represent a rare survivor of a major funerary process that usually
left no physical trace (Wait, 1985; Redfern, 2008). However, there is
ample evidence for variable treatment of the dead in the British
Iron Age and this bone could embody an alternative funerary process afforded for a small minority of Danebury's inhabitants. It
cannot be entirely excluded that sample 107 represents a more
common pattern of practice that is not widely evidenced in the
limited sample in this study.
The results of these analyses suggest a high degree of regulation
in practice, with distinct rites being adhered to for remains that
were ﬁnally deposited in a partially or fully articulated state and
those that are deposited as disarticulated fragments. Further
research is required on more people buried in the Danebury environs and from a broader range of Iron Age sites in order to characterize variation in funerary practice across Britain. The results of
this study challenge the assertion that disarticulated remains

recovered from British Iron Age sites invariably result from the
process of excarnation.
This study highlights the potential of integrating microscopic
analyses of bone diagenesis with other taphonomic evidence to
improve the resolution with which funerary treatment can be
reconstructed. Microscopic techniques can reveal discrete taphonomic information that cannot be discerned through macroscopic
examination alone and which can help to discriminate between
diverse taphonomic histories of bone samples. Comparison of
diagenetic signatures with previous studies of bioerosion and
bodily decomposition can provide speciﬁc interpretations of early
post-mortem processes when used alongside macroscopic taphonomic analyses. However, equiﬁnality remains a problem, and
there are persistent uncertainties regarding the types of processes
responsible for particular diagenetic signatures. Further experimental and archaeological research into bone bioerosion will help
to resolve these problems.
5. Conclusion
The human bones sampled from Danebury and Suddern Farm
demonstrated extensive but variable levels of bacterial bioerosion,
indicative of diversity in mortuary practice. The patterns of bacterial bioerosion suggested that three different funerary processes
were represented. Regulated, discrete rites appeared to have been
adhered to for remains ﬁnally deposited in a partially or fully articulated state and those deposited as disarticulated fragments.
The poor histological preservation of the discrete disarticulated
elements (except sample 107) suggests that they originated from
bodies that had been buried immediately after death. These bones
are consistent with a distinct practice of primary burial followed by
exhumation and re-deposition after skeletonisation. Partially and
fully articulated remains exhibited an unusual pattern of extensive
but incomplete histological destruction. The lack of experimental
research means it is impossible to provide a conﬁdent interpretation of funerary treatment, but the most parsimonious explanation
for these patterns is that bodies had been left to decompose in
covered or rapidly silting pits before being selectively manipulated
and buried. The anomalous histological and cortical preservation of
a single disarticulated bone provided evidence for excarnation. It is
likely that this bone represents another minority funerary rite, but
it could plausibly be a rare survivor of a process afforded to the
majority of the Iron Age dead which usually left no archaeological
trace. Overall, these results challenge the implication that disarticulated human remains from British Iron Age sites invariably
represent excarnation practices. The study of bone diagenesis e and
bacterial bioerosion in particular e can contribute positively to
interpretations of funerary processes as part of a suite of taphonomic evidence.
