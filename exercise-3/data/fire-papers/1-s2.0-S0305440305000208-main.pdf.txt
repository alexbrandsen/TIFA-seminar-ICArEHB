Abstract
Studies on burned bone have rarely been applied in understanding the human behavior behind the burning of animal remains.
The Middle Stone Age faunal assemblage from Sibudu Cave (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) contains a very high proportion of
burned bones. Based on previous experimental studies, a system of recording important aspects of burned bone was developed and
applied to a sample of contexts from Sibudu Cave. The results produced a picture of the nature of burned bone from hearths, and
described the bone from other features and general layers. It is believed that the bone at Sibudu was systematically being discarded
into Ô¨Åres and burned, and additional material was burned by buried bones coming into contact with hearths. Additional actualistic
work is needed to complete our understanding of archaeological burned bones.

1. Previous studies
Lyman in his summary of research on how bone
burns and how it can be recognized archaeologically
laments that actualistic studies of burned bone have not
translated into ‚Äò‚Äò.techniques for the unraveling of the
taphonomic histories of assemblages with varied frequencies of burned skeletal parts‚Äô‚Äô [16, p. 392]. In
reviewing the literature [3,6,7,9,16,21,28,29,36,37], I
believe that the techniques are available to begin to
unravel histories of cooking, waste disposal, and
incidental burning, as well as rule out other taphonomic
processes that mimic burned bone (e.g., [1,5,27,35,36
(pp. 156e160)]). Most studies however were not
speciÔ¨Åcally looking at the burning history of archaeo-

logical bone refuse. Instead, some were looking at
identifying techniques of human cremations [9,17,37];
others were looking to diÔ¨Äerentiate bone burned by
human use of Ô¨Åre from other sources of discoloration on
bone to identify early use of Ô¨Åre by Pleistocene hominids
(e.g., [7,29]).
An unusually large proportion of bone in the
Middle Stone Age (MSA) faunal assemblage from
Sibudu Cave is burned. In most contexts, burned bone
constitutes at least 80% of the assemblage. The reason
for this is not immediately clear, and what human
activities produced this burning. The abundant hearths
and ash patches that make up much of the MSA
deposit demonstrate that the inhabitants were commonly using controlled Ô¨Åre. However, only some of the
burned bone is associated with hearths, but the
presence of hearths and the intensity rule out natural
Ô¨Åres as an explanation. This study is intended to show
that it is possible to use burned bone to better
understand human activity and to identify gaps in the

research that need to be Ô¨Ålled through additional
experimental or ethnographic study.

2. Sibudu
Sibudu is a multi-component rockshelter site located
approximately 40 km north of Durban, South Africa
[32,34]. The site was originally tested in 1983 by Aaron
Mazel, and has been the subject of extensive excavation
since 1998 under the direction of Lyn Wadley of the
University of the Witwatersrand. The Ô¨Çoor of the
rockshelter is approximately 18 m to the back wall, and
55 m long [34]. The excavation unit as of early 2004 has
15 m2 excavated into MSA layers. The upper layers of the
site contain Iron Age material, under which are extensive
Middle Stone Age deposits. Excavations are continuing at
Sibudu. Therefore, the focus of this study is the upper
MSA layers that date to less than 70,000 years ago (Z.
Jacobs pers. comm.), which seems to contain the most
intensely burned faunal remains. The stratigraphy at
Sibudu consists of relatively shallow, brightly colored
lenses that are at times discontinuous or entwine with each
other. Initial sedimentological observations on a small
selection of levels [24] suggest that the matrix is made up
of a large proportion of ash, some eroded sandstone
grains, and other material derived from human activity at
the site (e.g. charcoal, bone, stone debitage). There are
clearly identiÔ¨Åable hearths and also enigmatic ash
patches. The analysis of the faunal assemblage is ongoing:
taxonomic identiÔ¨Åcations are being carried out by Ina
Plug [25], and the author is looking at taphonomic
information [10]. The microfauna is the subject of
a forthcoming Masters thesis by Wayne Glenny.
I believe there are four major explanations for the
burned bone at Sibudu, which have implications for
early modern human behavior:
 The burning is largely from food preparation e
roasting of meat on the bone or roasting of bones
to prepare marrow. This information would relate to
technology and nutrition for the early human
inhabitants at Sibudu.
 The burning could result from the disposal of part of
the fresh bone from human consumption into Ô¨Åre.
This behavior could be correlated to concepts of
hygiene, avoidance of competition from predators,
and duration of occupation at the cave.
 The burning might also derive from either fresh or
dry bone that after discard are burned by hearths
built over them. This incidental burning would
provide information on the length of occupation at
the site and use of space in the cave.
 It is also possible that the Sibudu inhabitants used
bone as part of the fuel for their hearths, as has been
demonstrated for sites in Europe [31].

3. Method
The methods are based on the descriptions from
burned bones of experimental and limited archaeological samples largely from Shipman et al. [28], Stiner et al.
[29], and Nicholson [21]. I discuss each part of the
methodology with what it reveals about the origin of the
burning sample and human behavior.
3.1. Size categories
The material from Sibudu has been extensively
fragmented: few fragments are larger than 5 cm in
maximum length. During cleaning, less than 2 cm bone
and greater than 2 cm bone are separated. Within the
greater than 2 cm sample, fragments are sub-divided
into 1-cm categories up to a ‚Äògreater than 5 cm‚Äô
category. Because of the possibility of sample size biases
from the small sample of greater than 2 cm bone, I
studied both fractions. However, the analysis of the less
than 2 cm fragments was limited to fragments between 2
and 0.5 cm. Although the less than 2 cm sample is better
in terms of sample size, only limited information could
be recorded for this material.
3.2. QuantiÔ¨Åcation
QuantiÔ¨Åcation of burning was based on number of
fragments [14]. DiÔ¨Äerential fragmentation of diÔ¨Äerently
burned elements may be a problem. As intensity of
burning increases, the fragility of the bone increases, and
thus the probability of an element being fragmented also
increases. However, reciprocal eÔ¨Äects help to minimize
fragmentation problems: lowered recovery will follow
from high fragmentation, especially for the less than
2 cm sample. The analysis of the small bone small
(fragments smaller than 2 cm) will be an important
monitor of fragmentation problems. The proportion of
white bone in almost all context is higher in the less than
2 cm sample than in the greater than 2 cm sample.
However, some white bone is being fragmented so that it
is not being recovered. The proportions of white bone in
the less than 2 cm fraction may be inÔ¨Çated, but they are
still small relative to other color categories. This
suggests that the results imprecise because of fragmentation, but not inaccurate.
3.3. Color
Color is the most commonly used identiÔ¨Åer of burned
bone and the intensity of heat that the bone reached.
The color-coding is usually done by recording the
predominant color based on descriptive colors or
reference to color tiles from the Munsell Soil Color
Chart [20]. I use a seven-grade scale similar to that used
by Stiner et al. [29: Table 7]) based on amounts of

carbonization and calcinization, and incorporate the
colors described by Nicholson [21]. The criteria used in
recording color are listed in Table 1. Only color was
recorded for the less than 2 cm sample.
The color of bone has been related to the intensity of
burning of bone, and indirectly to the situation in which
the burning occurred. The eÔ¨Äects of natural Ô¨Åres can be
diÔ¨Äerentiated from those of human controlled Ô¨Åres
based on the fact that natural Ô¨Åres tend to only burn
part of an element, burning tends to be superÔ¨Åcial, and
does not produce bone burned to grey or white [11].
Direct contact with a sustained Ô¨Åre from cooking or
disposal will produce a fuller range of burning intensity
although the cooking will cluster towards the lower
intensity to keep the Ô¨Çesh edible. Burning in hearths will
have a speciÔ¨Åc distribution of bone colors. Bone color
may also relate to identifying incidental burning. Bone
under hearths (not in direct contact with Ô¨Åre) is
insulated. In one replication experiment, bone was
burned to black [29]. In such instances, there should
be a range of colors from hardly burned to blackened. In
another study, bone under a hearth was exposed to
a more intense Ô¨Åre and for a longer duration [5]. This
caused some of the unburned bone to be burned to
a grey color. The researcher also noticed that Ô¨Åner soil
particle produced greater heat conductivity. The Ô¨Åne
sediments at Sibudu seem to suggest that incidental
burning could produce a nearly full range of burning
based on color.
Color can be an unreliable characteristic of burning
(e.g., [27]). Therefore, I examined texture of bone as
a check for burning intensity (see below). Also, a Masters
project on the histology of burned bone by Megan
Hanson, which included a few sample from Sibudu, is
conÔ¨Årming the identiÔ¨Åcation of substantial burning at
Sibudu.
3.4. Texture
Color and surface texture changes taken together
help corroborate the extent of burning although they do
not necessarily always agree [28]. An overall texture
of the bone was recorded following the four-stage
description from Nicholson [21: Table 2]: unburned,

4

glassy, cracking, and powdery (see Table 2). Originally,
she determined these criteria based on microscopic and
SEM study of a limited number of specimens from
experimental and archaeological material. In order to
get appropriate sample sizes to understand the assemblage, I used visual inspection with microscopic inspection of unusual specimens, which helped ensure that
color/texture categories are consistent and ruled out
other taphonomic factors (e.g., weathering; see [21,
p. 421]) as the cause for surface changes.
3.5. Uniformity
I also recorded the uniformity of burning across the
surface of the fragment. The variation in color for
a single element has been related to diÔ¨Äerences among
Ô¨Çeshed, fresh-deÔ¨Çeshed, and dry burned elements [5,9].
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, Buikstra and Swegle [9] report that uniformly blackened, or ‚Äòsmoked‚Äô specimens were only
from deÔ¨Çeshed green bone, not from Ô¨Çeshed or dry
bone. They observe that their experimental protocol
may not be generalized to all archaeological contexts
however. The presence of uniformly burned bone may
be a signal that bone may have been fresh, deÔ¨Çeshed
fragments although not all fresh elements turn into
uniformly black fragments. Fleshed elements would be
less strongly burned in areas covered by Ô¨Çesh. However,
few elements were complete enough to study this
criterion. Therefore, I use uniformity in color to
diÔ¨Äerentiate green bone (uniformly blackened) from
other types of bone (mottled in color).
3.6. Shaft burning
DiÔ¨Äerences between the interior and exterior of bone
fragments helped determine if the element was broken
before or after burning. Knight (1985) in Ref. [16,
p. 389]) reports that complete elements directly burned
will be calcined on the exterior but carbonized on the
interior. Johnson [15] notes in a Late Pleistocene cave
site in the US that diÔ¨Äerences in burning can be seen
between complete elements recently broken and elements broken prior to burning. Namely, ‚Äò‚Äòfracture
surfaces and the interior of the elements.were burned‚Äô‚Äô
only on elements with ancient breaks [15, p. 441].

876

C.R. Cain / Journal of Archaeological Science 32 (2005) 873e884

To study this, I recorded qualitative observations
on the nature of burning with each sample. I
recorded each observed phenomenon, and noted the
most common phenomenon in the sample. The criteria
were:
j burning is superÔ¨Åcial (possibly indicative of incidental burning),
j burning is uniform through the shaft wall (ancient
break and possibly green bone),
j burning is banded and appears more severe on the
exterior (complete element when burned, although
some may be ancient break),
j more severe on the interior (ancient break),
j fragments have black banding within wall of the
brown, grey, or white fragment (dry bone and
ancient break).

3.7. End burning
Particular attention was paid to blackening near
the ends and articulations of bones of more identiÔ¨Åable fragments. GiÔ¨Äord-Gonzanlez [13] suggests that
bone burned only on the articular ends were roasted
with Ô¨Çesh protecting the rest of the bone. Buikstra
and Swegle [9] also report diÔ¨Äerential cracking on the
ends of burned Ô¨Çeshed long bones. Unfortunately,
few long bone ends with attached diaphyses were
observed in this research or in the rest of the Sibudu
assemblage.

3.8. Clinker
I also attempted to identify contexts in which
‚Äò‚Äòclinker‚Äô‚Äô e the charred remains of organic material,
including meat, marrow, fat, skin, and hair e are
present [9]. The presence of this material can indicate
that animal remains were green and possibly Ô¨Çeshed at
the time of burning. The recovery strategy at Sibudu
did not speciÔ¨Åcally seek to recover and identify clinker
during sorting. Looking at the small bone fraction did
produce some probable clinkers, but fewer than if
recovery speciÔ¨Åcally identiÔ¨Åed and retained this
material.

4. Samples
Samples for analysis were selected from three types of
contexts: distinct intact hearths, ash patches, and
general stratigraphic layers. Hearths at Sibudu tend to
be approximately 40 cm in diameter, and are rarely
more than 5 cm in total depth. Hearths were rather
variable, but not as variable as ash patches, which
tended to have some examples with much larger
diameters than hearths. Table 3 describes the samples
used for this analysis. All contexts at Sibudu are dry
sieved through 3 mm mesh. All animal remains are
collected and curated, including identiÔ¨Åable and ‚ÄònonidentiÔ¨Åable‚Äô material. This study (or most good faunal
analyses) would not be possible without proper recovery
and collection. All the material studied are from the

later Middle Stone Age layers at Sibudu that date to less
than 70,000 years ago [34].
The hearths identiÔ¨Åed in the excavations from Sibudu
usually have at least two zones: an upper white ashy lens
overlying a dark grey-black lens. The zone under
hearths is usually indicated at Sibudu by a redden soil
color. However, there is variation in the appearance of
hearths in any archaeological deposit. At times, it seems
that one hearth was constructed on top of another,
which produced variation in the layering. When
possible, hearths were studied by layer within the hearth.
However, some hearths at Sibudu were excavated as
a single feature. Such contexts were analyzed as
a ‚Äòcombined‚Äô hearth.
Ash patches are small distinct patches of diÔ¨Äerent
colored soil within a larger stratigraphic context, and do
not resemble the classic coloration for an in situ hearth.
In certain contexts at Sibudu, ash patches or clusters of
ash patches are common. What these patches represent
is unclear: they could represent disturbed or mixed
hearths, ash dumping events, or some other formation
process. Solveig Schiegl et al. [26] examined chemical,
phytoliths, and other microscopic aspects of the deposits
to understand how they were formed, and concluded
that they are hearth related deposits. If they are
distorted hearths or hearth contents, they would resemble a combination of the faunal material from in situ
hearths. If they are part of midden deposits, the bone
fragments from these contexts would resemble a palimpsest of hearth and non-hearth bone fragments.
Much burning was noted in the bone from the
general stratigraphic contexts at Sibudu. To determine
the origin of this burning and whether diÔ¨Äerential
burning was associated with diÔ¨Äerent stratigraphic
contexts, a sample of units from diÔ¨Äerent types of strata
was studied. I selected samples away from ash lenses and
hearths to give an unadulterated picture of general
contexts at Sibudu. Three broad categories of layers
were used based on the visual appearance (i.e., predominant color and texture): pale, dark, and ashy. The
pale contexts were white, light brown, or pale pink in
color. They were often well consolidated and appeared
to have signiÔ¨Åcant amounts of highly burned bone in the
matrix. The dark layers were dark brown to black, and
had a high organic content from charcoal, which
resulted in the matrix having a greasy quality. The ashy
contexts were brown to grey, were generally loose, and
seemed to have relatively less burning.

5. Results
The burning intensity results from color and surface
texture for each type of context are shown in Tables 4
and 5. Table 4 summarizes the extent of heating criteria
for hearths and ash patches: color and texture for

877

greater than 2 cm, and color for less than 2 cm
fragments. Table 5 contains the same information for
general layers.

5.1. Hearths by layer
One feature (Hearth 3) I studied at Sibudu Ô¨Åt the
classic hearth pattern: white, black, and discolored
burned subsoil. The other two hearths appear to be welldeÔ¨Åned hearths in terms of shape and regular layering,
but variation in burning created diÔ¨Äerent additional
layers for Hearths 1 and 2. Repeated Ô¨Årings may create
such patterns and modify the appearance of the original
hearth.
All the hearths had a pale, whitish ash layer on the
top. Color of the less than 2 cm fragments tended
towards the highly burned end of the spectrum in this
layer: abundant fragments burned grey through white,
and only about 10% or less burned black. For the most
part the larger bone sample also showed intensely
burned bone. However, the larger bone fragments in
this level from Hearth 3 were not highly burned: none
were burned grey-white or black, and none had a surface
texture other than ‚Äòcharred‚Äô. Surface texture for the
upper ash layers in Hearths 1 and 2 reÔ¨Çected high
temperature burning.
All of the Sibudu hearths I studied had a black layer
at the base, which all seemed similar to each other. The
color of the less than 2 cm bone contained proportionally more black and brown material than the white ash
layers. For the larger than 2 cm sample, the majority of
fragments were dark brown or black, although the dark
layer in Hearth 3 seemed to have a considerable portion
less thoroughly burned. Eighty to 100 percent of the
surfaces were charred or unmodiÔ¨Åed from these layers.
Hearth 2 resembles two superimposed hearths, and
therefore I had assumed that the lower set of lenses had
been aÔ¨Äected by the burning event that produced the
upper hearth. The diÔ¨Äerences between the two sets of
ash/dark lenses however seem to show that the lower
unit was less highly burned than the upper. Therefore,
the duration or temperature of the upper burning event
may have been more damaging for the bone within that
hearth, and did not noticeably aÔ¨Äect the material in the
lower layers.
In Hearth 1, the excavator deÔ¨Åned three additional
layers: orange-white, brown-black, and orange-brown.
For the orange-white level, the less than 2 cm bone
fragments were less highly burned than in the white
layer with more bone burned black. The orange-brown
level showed very intense burning in both the small and
larger bone samples: very high percentage of grey-white
bone. The brown-black layer had moderate signs of
burning with most bone being dark brown or black for
both the small and large bone samples.

5.2. Hearths as a context
In order to identify if there was a typical pattern of
burning from a hearth, I combined the layer data for all
of the previously described hearths so that they could be
compared with hearths excavated as a single context.
The colors for the greater than 2 cm bone sample for
Hearths 1e3 when aggregated were approximately: 25e
30% grey-white, w15% black, 40e45% dark brown,
and w10% brown-cream. Similar proportions were
found in the combined Hearths (4, 5, and 6) although
there was variation, which may result from diÔ¨Äerences in
sample size. Hearth 6 seems to have a higher proportion
of highly burned bone than Hearths 4, 5, or the
combined data from Hearths 1e3 based on the
percentages of grey-white bone and texture. The texture
results from Hearths (1e5) show a heavy preponderance
of charred bone: w70% charred. Although not all of the
less than 2 cm bone was available for analysis, the
smaller bone sample gave similar proportions between
the hearths excavated by layers and the combined
hearths. However, Hearth 6 showed a greater spread
with higher proportions of highly burned and unburned
bone in both the larger and small bone categories.
Various factors will aÔ¨Äect how Ô¨Åre aÔ¨Äects bone, such as
the duration, amount of fuel, and when the bone entered
the hearth, which may explain the variation among the
hearths analyzed. However, there does seem to be strong
‚Äòmedian‚Äô characteristics for the hearths from Sibudu.
5.3. Ash complexes
I studied the individual patches within the ash patches
to compare their levels with levels from hearths. For ash
complex 1, the color for the small bone from the black
and dark brown levels centers on high proportions of
black and dark brown bones. These samples seem similar
to the black levels from Hearth 2. The bottom two levels e
grey-brown and pale brown e are both highly burned,
but the color distribution of the small bone in the pale

brown layer suggests more well burned bone. However,
there is a large discrepancy in the texture analysis: The
grey-brown layer has less cracked surfaces than the pale
brown layer. These layers seem to have aÔ¨Énity to the
upper white ash contexts from in situ hearths.
For ash complex 2, color and texture reÔ¨Çect moderate
burning. The brown layer based on the color of the less
than 2 cm bone was intensely burned. The black layer
was similar to the dark lenses in formal hearths. The
yellow layer showed high levels of burning like the
brown layer, but with a signiÔ¨Åcant proportion of lightly
burned bone.
The color and texture analyses suggest similarities
between the ash complexes and the hearths (Table 4).
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, certain lenses from the ash complexes
match up well with the color and texture of material
from lenses in the hearths studied by layer. However,
looking at the other criteria table (Table 6), the
signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerence is that the ash complexes have
little material larger than 2 cm.
5.4. Levels
The general levels have distinct burning patterns that
relate to the color and texture of the deposit. The bone
from each type of layer was exposed to a diÔ¨Äerent
intensity of burning.
Both pale levels studied had exceptionally high levels
of burning: SS more so than SPCA although the
variation is reduced in the less than 2 cm sample. For
both the pale units, the color of the small bone sample
and the texture analysis showed that large portions of
the assemblages are highly burned. The bone contents
of these levels resemble the white and ashy top levels of
the hearths described above.
The material from the dark levels tends to be
characterized by large amounts of moderately burned
bone, but there was some variation among contexts.
Generally, 50e80% of material was black or dark
brown for both the large and small bone samples. No

context had signiÔ¨Åcant portion of the material burned
white and light grey. One of the BSp contexts was
unusual in that it had more lightly burned material
according to color and texture than other contexts. The
pattern of having more than half of the sample burned
dark brown or black is similar to the pattern seen in the
dark lenses in the hearths.
The ashy units appear to have a much more even
spread in the intensity of burn damage on the bone in
the color of the large and small bone samples and the
texture analysis. These context bear some resemblance
to the aggregated hearth and ash complex proportions
although ashy layers tend to have more lightly burned
(i.e., dark brown and brown) bone.
5.5. General observations
Table 6 summarizes the other criteria from all
contexts relating to the timing of burning. The other

non-temperature related characteristics seem to a lack of
patterning that would separate the diÔ¨Äerent types
of contexts studied at Sibudu. Overall, there is little
uniformity in the burning along elements, which
suggests that not all of the elements were deÔ¨Çeshed
green elements when they were burned. The mottling
along the surfaces has been suggested to mean Ô¨Çeshed
elements or dry elements. The Ô¨Çeshed elements would
leave however areas under the Ô¨Çesh that would be
uniformly unburned. Also, the reburning of originally
uniformly burned specimens might produce the variable
color seen on the Sibudu material.
The criteria for superÔ¨Åcial burning that does not
penetrate the fragment wall (seen in recent breaks)
would be indicative of unburned fragments being
burned lightly and/or brieÔ¨Çy by incidental contact with
Ô¨Åre. This is rarely seen in the hearths or ash complexes,
which probably strongly came into contact with Ô¨Åre, but
is seen to a small extent in general contexts, which

C.R. Cain / Journal of Archaeological Science 32 (2005) 873e884

suggests that some material in the general layers may
have been burned by contact with hearths.
The criteria that the shaft wall is uniformly burned
suggest two things: the element was broken before
burning and that the element was possibly green. This
condition is seen occasionally, but is not very common.
If the original element was complete during burning,
burning would generally be more severe on the exterior
since the exterior would contact the Ô¨Çame directly.
However at Sibudu, exterior and interior severe burning
are both common throughout the diÔ¨Äerent contexts
studied. Therefore, it seems that the most of the
elements were broken at some time in antiquity before
Ô¨Ånal burning.
Researchers looking at cremation have noted that dry
bone will have a black band on the interior of an
element. However, combusting organic material in green
bone will also turn burned bone black (e.g., char on
bone surfaces). In the Sibudu material, many elements
were dark brown or grey on the exterior but black
within the wall of the fragment. This suggests two
things: that the elements were broken before the Ô¨Ånal
burning to allow consistent burning around the fragment and that many of the fragments were dry or
slightly green when they were burned.
Among the very few articular ends noted, few have
burning at the ends and not on the shafts. Thus, they do
not indicate roasting of Ô¨Çesh on the bone. Subsequent
burning after cooking may have masked the traces. Plus,
most of the element ends are missing from the Sibudu
sample. The reasons for this are still under study. Some
clinker fragments were occasionally found in the Sibudu
material suggesting that some of the bone was burned
green. Unfortunately, there is little information to
compare animal based clinker with clinker from other
sources (e.g., plant resin).

6. Discussion
This study has provided some information on the
timing and the context of the bone burning, and provisional reasons for the burned bone at Sibudu.
It is diÔ¨Écult to determine if the bone from Sibudu
was fresh or dry when it was exposed to Ô¨Åre. The criteria
devised for human cremations to diÔ¨Äerentiate deÔ¨Çeshed
bone burned green vs. dry seems diÔ¨Écult to apply to
archaeological material, since the criteria assume complete elements. The method described by Villa and
Mahieu [30] for diÔ¨Äerentiating dry vs. green fracture
patterns also relies on nearly complete element circumferences, which are not available in this assemblage.
Also, few long bones with epiphyses are available to
evaluate if the material was roasted. The high frequency
of shaft fragments with burning suggests that burning
occurred on deÔ¨Çeshed elements or that reburning

881

occurred after human consumption. The identiÔ¨Åcation
of clinker that may come from animal remains and the
glassy char on many fragments suggest that at least part
of the assemblage was burned green. But, the recovery
of clinker is not a straight-forward process, and thus has
only occasionally been observed. Furthermore, many
fragments burned green may have been reburned (thus
being dry) possibly overprinting any previous pattern.
Therefore, I believe both dry and green burning is seen
at Sibudu.
Throughout the deposits at Sibudu, most of the bone
appears burned: the bone in the general excavation
levels burned dark brown to white is 80e95%. The
frequency of hearths and the extensive contribution of
ash to the matrix [24] suggest that occupation at Sibudu
during the later MSA was intensive. Very intense
burning reÔ¨Çected in samples by light grey or white bone
and bone with texture 4 indicates that some of the
burning is from direct contact with human controlled
Ô¨Åre. However, part of the burning is probably from
material previously deposited coming into contact with
heat from hearths in succeeding occupations. The Ô¨Åne
matrix at Sibudu would conduct the heat well [5].
However, incidental burning would cause a patchy
distribution of burning, yet the burning at Sibudu is
thorough and consistent through the layers. In the
hearths, the ash patches, and the pale layers, more
intense burning indicates direct contact with Ô¨Åre. The
dark and ashy layers may have been partly formed by
incidental burning, but that is probably not suÔ¨Écient to
explain the high percentage of burned bone in these
layers.
It appears that burning was generally on fragments of
bone. Roasting of whole elements may have occurred,
but it is not suÔ¨Écient to explain the majority of the
burning at Sibudu. The burning on the interior and
exterior of fragments indicates that they were burned, at
least for the Ô¨Ånal time, as fragments. Also, the large
numbers of human-produced bone breakage marks
suggest signiÔ¨Åcant pre-depositional breakage [10]. The
discussion above on the timing of the burning indicates
some but perhaps not all burning was on green material.
In the deposits from Middle Paleolithic of Europe,
bone was used as a fuel for hearths [31], but the data
does not suggest the common use of bone as fuel at
Sibudu. The two criteria for demonstrating systematic
use of bone for fuel in the Palaeolithic are the rarity of
charcoal relative to bone, and the high representation of
burned spongy bone ends relative to burned long bones
since they burn better than compact long bone shafts
[31]. However, charcoal is an abundant artifact at
Sibudu ([32]; Allott pers. comm.). Many parts of Europe
in the Middle Paleolithic were predominantly cold
grassland with limited wood resources, but the preliminary environmental reconstructions for Sibudu
suggest many woody species in the vicinity of the cave,

882

C.R. Cain / Journal of Archaeological Science 32 (2005) 873e884

especially along the river [2,33]. Also, spongy bone
fragments e burned or unburned e are rare at Sibudu,
whereas long bone fragments are common and are
commonly burned.
From studying diÔ¨Äerent contexts at Sibudu, I found
patterns in the intensity of burning in hearths, and used
this information and additional information to understand the burning found in other contexts at Sibudu.
The hearths show a typical pattern, but inevitably, there
is variation within archaeological hearths. Large pieces
of bone were not abundant in hearths, and thus the less
than 2 cm sample gave more reliable results on the
burning intensity and should be studied in future
burning studies.
The signiÔ¨Åcance of the ash patches at Sibudu was
unclear prior to this study. The distribution of the
criteria for intensity of burning e color and surface
texture e of the ash complexes when levels are combined
is similar to that of the combined hearths. This similarity
has been corroborated through other analyses [26]. The
major diÔ¨Äerence between hearths and the ash complexes
was the virtual lack of bone greater than 2 cm in the ash
complexes. It could be that the ash complexes are the
contents of hearths that have been swept out and
redeposited e the ash and very small bone being
separated from larger bone fragments. Ethnoarchaeological studies of hearths in hunter-gatherer campsites
often focus on the spatial arrangement and activity areas
[8,12,19,22,23]. However, one group of researchers [12,
p. 223] discusses the maintenance of hearths among the
Efe Pygmy where ash is swept up and discarded in areas
for refuse before starting a new Ô¨Åre. When the camp is
abandoned or occupied only brieÔ¨Çy, little site maintenance is done. Site size probably also contributes to the
level of site maintenance [12, p. 231]. The restricted
space within rock shelters suggests more site maintenance even for short occupations [4]. At Sibudu, I
believe that the humans occupying the site were carrying
out some kind of hearth maintenance, although the
length and periodicity of occupation at Sibudu is
unclear. I believe that the occupation was not brief
based on the intensity of occupation and the range of
animal species found [32,25], and thus the people at
Sibudu were staying long enough to require some hearth
maintenance. However, they did not produce distinct
midden areas in the areas we are excavating.
Most of the Sibudu bone is not found in hearths or
ash patches but in the general matrix. The intensity of
burning reÔ¨Çected in the bones was reÔ¨Çected in the
appearance of the levels. The pale and dark layers in the
intensity of burning resembled the layers typically found
in the hearths at Sibudu. It is unclear how the bone in
the pale or dark levels came to be burned e whether it
from wide-spread burning events during formation, or
from a series of localized but consistent burning events.
Work on the geomorphology of the deposits is

continuing and may help answer this question. The
ashy/brown levels contained bone that was consistent
with the bone in combined hearths, and may reÔ¨Çect the
amalgamation of bone and ash removed from hearths.
However, incidental burning of fragments is possible if
burning and occupation in the succeeding layer was
intense and hearth construction was fairly ubiquitous.
Although some burning probably preceded human
consumption, almost all of the bone fragments found at
Sibudu appear to have been burned to a signiÔ¨Åcant
degree after breakage and thus during discard and
deposition, which made earlier burning events invisible.
I believe the bone was burned for disposal to make it less
odorous and unattractive to carnivores, yet it is diÔ¨Écult
to test. It would also have been easy to throw the bone
over the front edge of the rockshelter. This is an
interpretation by default, and it is possible that another
interpretation might be made for the common burning
of broken, dry and green long bone shafts sometimes at
very high temperatures.

7. Conclusion
The analysis of the Sibudu burned bone has clariÔ¨Åed
some aspects of the origin of the burning in the
assemblage, but some questions remain. I believe that
Sibudu is an unusual MSA site in the region because
of its high levels of burning (e.g., Klasies River Mouth
has 4.5% from a unsystematically recovered sample
of ‚ÄòidentiÔ¨Åed‚Äô material; [18]). Restudy of other MSA
assemblages for taphonomy of burning could identify
cultural or environmental diÔ¨Äerences among sites. I
believe that the speciÔ¨Åc analysis of burned bone to
understand human use of Ô¨Åre, disposal of faunal
remains, and other behaviors is an useful but underutilized means of understanding ancient human activity for
MSA sites and sites from other archaeological periods.
The current literature on burned bone greatly aided
this analysis, but gaps in our understanding still remain.
The four problems I observed were:
j There is little information on how multiple burning
episodes aÔ¨Äect bone: is it an additive eÔ¨Äect or an
exponential eÔ¨Äect, or do bones reÔ¨Çect only the
maximum heating situation? EquiÔ¨Ånality might be
a signiÔ¨Åcant problem for this line of research as well.
j It is not possible to diÔ¨Äerentiate green vs. dry burned
bone for small fragments.
j The identiÔ¨Åcation of clinker can be important, but
there is a lack of appropriate procedure to monitor
the presence of clinker in the archaeological record.
j The identiÔ¨Åcation of clinker is ambiguous because
there is currently no way to evaluate what kind of
organic material was burned (e.g., plant vs. animal
tissue).

C.R. Cain / Journal of Archaeological Science 32 (2005) 873e884

This research can be viewed as a step towards better
understanding the origin of burned bone at ancient sites.
Usually, burned bone is only reported as the frequency
of fragments with signs of burning, but many variables
characterize a burned bone assemblage. Better techniques to understand the origin of burned bone can
potentially be used to understand culinary techniques,
waste disposal, use of space, and the origins of the use of
Ô¨Åre for ancient human and human-ancestor sites.
