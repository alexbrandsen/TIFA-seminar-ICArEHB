Building on previous research at smaller scales, in this paper we assemble paleoecological data and
archaeological time-series for deserts located in three latitudinal bands along the South American Arid
Diagonal (16°–41°S, 1,236,000 km2 of area). Diverse proxies suggest the existence of arid and extremely
arid conditions in large parts of these deserts. Working with a database composed of 914 archaeological
dates falling between the first human presence in each region and 3000 years BP, which produce a minimum number of 578 occupational events, we identify a series of patterns at a macro-regional scale: a
robust increase in the temporal signal at the beginning of the mid-Holocene (8000–7600 years BP) followed by two troughs (7600–7200, 6800–6400 years BP) during this period. The spatial scope of the data
presented provides an opportunity for disentangling processes of spatial re-localization from actual
changes in population size. We present a demographic hypothesis at a macro-regional scale, which suggests the existence of mid-Holocene population bottleneck(s). This hypothesis would account not only for
the mid-Holocene troughs, but also for the posterior record of an intense and relatively rapid population
growth (release) observed in many regions of the arid diagonal. These mid-Holocene events provide the
context for independent trajectories of economic intensification based on different sets of resources marine foods, camelids, and also probably wetland resources-, some of which lead to domestication processes. These cases occur in association with a tendency towards reduced residential mobility in regions
that may have acted as refugia during arid periods of the mid-Holocene.
The analysis produces testable expectations for future research at different scales and for different
research domains, including human DNA and morphometric evidence. We consider that these issues
have a fecund comparative potential, since the analysis of the socio-demographic meaning of archaeological discontinuities in different continents shares a similar conceptual structure.

1. Introduction: building from the local to the continental
Archaeological discontinuities are a multi-layered phenomenon
with demographic, informational, economic, technological, and
taphonomic interacting dimensions. These levels are inextricably
linked in historical processes. Assessing the behavioral, demographic, and evolutionary meaning of archaeological discontinuities is a highly complex endeavor permeated by issues of scale
(Bailey, 2007; Holdaway and Wandsnider, 2006). The behavioral
and demographic mechanisms invoked to explain discontinuities
vary according to the temporal and spatial scale of patterns

recorded in the data. Following ‘time perspectivism’ (Bailey,
2007), we consider that evidence at different scales can reveal
the operation of diverse processes that can be hierarchically connected. Thus, zooming out the scale of analysis becomes a powerful
tool for envisioning answers otherwise concealed at smaller scales,
traditionally used in the archaeological research in South American
deserts.
Archaeological radiocarbon databases provide a spatialtemporal proxy reflecting human rates of human discard of datable
material (Rick, 1978; Williams, 2012). The use of summed probabilities of radiocarbon dates as a demographic proxy has grown
in scope, methodological robustness, and theoretical insight
(Bueno et al., 2013; Gamble et al., 2004; Shennan et al., 2013;
Surovell et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2015). Some recent debate
has focused on the validity of this line of enquiry based on system-

R. Barberena et al. / Journal of Anthropological Archaeology 46 (2017) 68–81

atic and random sources of bias that question the chain of connection between time-series and reconstruction of human demography (Bamforth and Grund, 2012; Contreras and Meadows, 2014;
García Guraieb et al., 2015). Besides specific methodological
responses (Timpson et al., 2014), we consider that this method
provides a productive approach to explore structure in the data
at a multiplicity of scales, helping to produce hypotheses that
can be subjected to scrutiny from independent proxies, genomic
analyses paramount among them (Gamble et al., 2004; Sundell
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2007).
In this paper we undertake an exploratory analysis of the temporal trajectories of human occupation in desert regions located
along the South American Arid Diagonal (SAAD from now
onwards). The goal is to explore the behavioral and demographic
meaning of archaeological troughs and gaps in human signals
recorded for the mid-Holocene (8000–5000 years BP). This period
has received increasing attention in South American deserts, in
particular regarding the presence of archaeological hiatuses, initially termed ‘archaeological silence’ by Núñez and Santoro
(1988; see also Grosjean et al., 2007). This trough, which was first
analyzed through settlement patterns and later on with radiocarbon datasets, was associated with the advent of global and local
mid-Holocene climate changes (Anderson et al., 2007; Gil et al.,
2005). Increasing arid conditions starting ca. 9000–8500 years BP
recorded in diverse paleoclimatic archives in the Andes and nearby
areas (Lamy et al., 1999, 2004; Latorre et al., 2003) have provided
the frame for studying human responses to climatic change and
resource degradation (Méndez et al., 2015; Neme and Gil, 2009).
Volcanic eruptions have also been suggested to operate at local
and regional scales (Durán et al., in press).
The analysis presented here is based on a compilation of radiocarbon databases recently published for the following regions
(Fig. 1): (a) ‘Low latitudes of the SAAD’ (16°–25°S), usually referred
to as the South Central Andes, which include northern Chile, southern Peru and western Bolivia (Gayo et al., 2015; Grosjean et al.,
2007; Marquet et al., 2012); (b) ‘Mid latitudes of the SAAD’ (29°–
35°S), integrating Cuyo region of Argentina and North Central Chile
(Méndez, 2013; Méndez et al., 2015; Neme and Gil, 2009); and (c)
‘High latitudes of the SAAD’ (35°–41°S), corresponding to northwestern Patagonia in Argentina and Southern Chile (Barberena et al.,
2015; Campbell and Quiroz, 2015).
Enhanced aridity in already dry regions would increase environmental unpredictability and the associated costs of use of marginal
lands (Mandryk, 1993). The most immediate response by mobile
hunter-gatherers to increased risks would be spatial reorganization and/or relocation (Garvey, 2008; Méndez et al., 2015), which
could lead to abandonment of regions in different spatial scales
and for varying amounts of time. So far, working at local and regional levels, evidence of local abandonments and spatial re-locations
has been presented for a number of desert regions along the Andes
(Marquet et al., 2012; Neme and Gil, 2009; Núñez et al., 2002;
Yacobaccio, 2013). While providing the basis for an assessment
of the impact of climate change in local populations, this scale of
analysis does not allow estimation of the overall demographic trajectories in the South American deserts and neighbor areas. The
question in hand is whether the coincidence of multiple discontinuities in neighboring areas is evidence enough of a demographic
decrease, which may display seemingly divergent local archaeological trajectories. Our core methodological suggestion is that, by
augmenting the analytical scope, we can disentangle processes of
spatial re-localization and/or reorganization of mobility from significant demographic changes at the level of metapopulations
(i.e., significant increase or decrease in the numbers of people
inhabiting a given unit of space). On this basis, we can then explore
the behavioral and demographic basis of archaeological
discontinuities.

2. South American Arid Diagonal: ecology and paleoecology
Large-scale patterns in the climate of southern South America
are related to major atmospheric circulation patterns. The interaction of two large climatic systems that control precipitation patterns, the tropical easterlies and the southern westerlies, and the
orographic (rain-shadow) effect of the Andes, results in the major
climatic and biogeographic boundary of the SAAD, an arid NW-SE
continuous area which extends from Peru to southern Argentina
(Figs. 1 and 2) (Abraham de Vazquez et al., 2000; Bruniard, 1982;
Villagrán and Hinojosa, 1997). The SAAD, which originated during
the Pliocene (Villagrán and Hinojosa, 1997), has remained relatively stable since then, but global and regional climate change
during the Late Quaternary has had important changes in the distribution of plants, animals, and human populations (Betancourt
et al., 2000; Grosjean et al., 2003; Latorre et al., 2013; Marquet
et al., 2012; Méndez et al., 2015).
The three latitudinal bands considered here present striking
topographic, climatic, and ecological contrasts. In Fig. 2 we reproduce their main eco-physiographic properties. In Fig. 3 we present
an overview of some settings. In the ‘Low latitudes of the SAAD’
space is subdivided in: (a) coastal Atacama region, (b) inland Atacama region, and (c) Bolivian Altiplano region (Gayo et al., 2015). In
the ‘Mid latitudes of the SAAD’, space is stratified in: (a) Pacific coast,
(b) western valleys, (c) West Andes, (d) East Andes, (e) Eastern
foothills, (f) Eastern lowlands (Méndez et al., 2015). Finally, for
the ‘High latitudes of the SAAD’ space is subdivided in: (a) Pacific
coast, (b) Valleys, and (c) Western Andes, (d) Eastern Andes, (e)
Eastern steppes (Barberena et al., 2015; Campbell and Quiroz,
2015).
In Fig. 4 we present an overview of dominant climate trends
since the late Pleistocene onwards for the three latitudinal bands
considered. These tendencies are assessed in detail below.

2.1. Low latitudes of the SAAD (16°–25°S): South Central Andes of
Chile, Peru, and Bolivia
After widespread humid conditions during the late Pleistoceneearly Holocene (Betancourt et al., 2000; Latorre et al., 2002, 2003;
Maldonado et al., 2005; Sylvestre et al., 1999), extreme arid conditions were established in the South Central Andes around
9500 years BP, peaking at 9000–7000 years BP (Betancourt et al.,
2000; Grosjean et al., 2003; Latorre et al., 2003; Maldonado et al.,
2005), although the timing of this arid phase varies from site to
site. After this arid phase, still more extreme arid conditions characterized the mid-Holocene, but the onset of this environmental
condition is a matter of discussion (Grosjean, 2001; Quade et al.,
2008). On one hand, wetland and rodent midden-associated plant
macro-remains records suggest that less arid conditions would
have occurred since 8000–7000 years BP (Betancourt et al., 2000;
Latorre et al., 2003; Rech et al., 2002). On the other hand, and in
agreement with our view, lake sedimentary records and alluvial
deposits from the Altiplano and the Salar de Atacama suggest that
the arid phase would have lasted until 4000–3000 years BP, interrupted by a moist pulse around 6000–5000 years BP (Bobst et al.,
2001; Grosjean, 2001; Grosjean et al., 2003). Pollen records from
rodent middens at 21°S indicate the termination of the arid phase
around 3300 years BP, supporting the second alternative
(Maldonado and Uribe, 2015). During the late Holocene, highly
variable environmental conditions at centennial-to-millennial
scales occurred in the South Central Andes, but under less dry scenarios than those of the mid-Holocene. A series of moderate humid
phases were recorded at 21°S in the highlands between 2400–
720 years BP peaking at 2000 and 1000 years BP (Maldonado and
Uribe, 2015), and in the lowlands at 2245–2230, 1615–1350, and

1050–650 years BP (Gayo et al., 2012). At the Central Atacama
Desert (22°–25°S), humid phases occurred between 1700–
1000 years BP (22°300 S; Latorre et al., 2003), 1500–600 years BP
(25°300 S; Maldonado et al., 2005), and 1000–500 years BP (24°S;
Latorre et al., 2002). It is possible that the onset of the late Holocene moisture increase in the Central Atacama Desert began
around 1700 years BP, presenting a peak by 1500 years BP so as
to be recorded in the most arid areas.

2.2. Mid latitudes of the SAAD’ (29°–35°S): Cuyo region of Argentina,
North Central Chile and Norte Chico
During the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (ca. 11,500 years
BP), a change from humid and cold conditions to similar to modern
conditions occurred (Villagrán and Varela, 1990) in Central Chile
and Norte Chico. Then, most of the records suggest early Holocene

humid conditions interrupted by an arid phase centered at
9200 years BP represented as an expansion of xerophytic scrubland
taxa and a decrease of local humidity indicators (Jenny et al., 2002;
Maldonado and Villagrán, 2006). Starting in 8500 years BP, the
mid-Holocene was characterized by widespread and extreme arid
conditions particularly accentuated between 7800 and 6200 years
BP (Jenny et al., 2002; Maldonado and Villagrán, 2002, 2006;
Valero-Garcés et al., 2005; Villa-Martínez et al., 2003). Following
the mid-Holocene arid conditions, swamp-forests and terrestrial
pollen records show a gradual trend towards increased humidity
started, peaking at 4500 years BP, which was recorded as a dramatic decrease of Chenopodiaceae percentages in lake records
(Valero-Garcés et al., 2005; Villa-Martínez et al., 2003) and a rise
of local moisture taxa indicators in swamp forests (32°S;
Maldonado and Villagrán, 2002, 2006), whereas marine core
records indicate a gradual decrease of temperature (Kim et al.,
2002; Lamy et al., 1999).

On the contrary, the scarce records located eastwards of the
Andes point out humid conditions between 6400 and 5000 years
BP. Thus, the presence of Patagonian shrub communities that
develop today 100–500 m up slope the Laguna El Sosneado location and a maximum fire frequency and magnitude suggest high
fuel availability and, therefore, high water availability during this
period (Navarro et al., 2012). On the other hand, Neoglacial
advances that occurred between 6400 and 4800 years BP at the
Río Valenzuela basin (35°S), strongly dependent on precipitation
(Espizúa and Pitte, 2009), suggest humid conditions (Espizúa,
2005). During the late Holocene, most SAAD records show high climatic variability under similar-to-present conditions related to an
increased frequency of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO from
now onwards) events during the last 2000 years (Rein et al.,
2005). Laguna El Sosneado record shows, however, a trend towards
drier conditions up to present ones (Navarro et al., 2012).
2.3. High latitudes of the SAAD’ (35°–41°S): northwestern Patagonia in
Argentina and South Central Chile
Most records between 41° and 42°S along the western Andes
show abrupt increases and dominance of the thermophilous Valdivian trees Eucryphia/Caldcluvia between 11,500 and 7000 years BP
(Abarzúa et al., 2004; Jara and Moreno, 2014; Moreno, 2004;
Moreno and León, 2003; Villagrán, 1990), whereas between 38
and 39°S, a Nothofagus obliqua-dominated forest developed
(Abarzúa, 2009; Heusser, 1984). This dramatic vegetation change
in the Late Glacial plant communities suggests the establishment
of peak interglacial warmth (multi-millennial warm/dry phase)
and a substantial reduction in precipitation driven by a regional
weakening of the westerly winds. Since 7000 years BP, a gradual

expansion of the north Patagonian forest between 41 and 42°S
indicates overall cool-temperate conditions associated to a precipitation increase compared to the early Holocene, brought on by an
equator-ward shift/intensification of the southern Westerlies
(Heusser, 1966; Jara and Moreno, 2014; Vargas et al., 2008). At
38–39°S, changes in the forest composition reveal wetter conditions but still presenting thermophilous elements, therefore suggesting warm scenarios up to 2000 years BP (Abarzúa, 2009).
Coupled with cooler conditions, enhanced fire activity prevailed
over the region during the mid-Holocene, pointing out high climatic variability mainly related to ENSO (Jara and Moreno, 2012).
A well-defined west-to-east vegetation gradient developed
eastward of the Andes during the late Pleistocene-early Holocene
(Iglesias et al., 2014; Markgraf et al., 2009; Whitlock et al., 2006).
Then, no major vegetation changes were recorded during the
mid-Holocene given that their dynamics mainly involved
millennial- and centennial- trade-offs between trees and shrubs
that were likely brought about by shifts in water availability. At
39°S, a high diversity of the steppe recorded in Mallín Vaca Lauquen between 12,000 and 8000 years BP was interpreted as
increased precipitation and temperature, though below present
values (Markgraf et al., 2009). Based on the later, it was hypothesized that the existence of opposite precipitation patterns west
and east of the Andes (dipole) would have been the result of an
anomalous component of the upper level flow. However, the development of open Nothofagus dombeyi forest supporting substantial
amounts of steppe and scrubland elements associated with recurrent fires in Laguna El Trébol (41°S) between 11,400 and
6000 years BP was interpreted as a signal of drier than present conditions (Whitlock et al., 2006). In synthesis, Laguna El Trébol record
supports the arid conditions recorded in those sites on the leeward

side of the Andes and does not match the climatic inferences (precipitation dipole) proposed by Markgraf et al. (2009). During the
last 5000 years, higher effective moisture promoted the development of modern vegetation likely as a response to the continued
northward shift/strengthening of the southern westerlies, as well
as the strengthening of ENSO-related climate variability (Lamy
et al., 2004; Markgraf et al., 2007, 2013).
3. Materials and methods
3.1. Materials
We integrate four radiocarbon databases that have been compiled in previous publications (Barberena et al., 2015; Campbell
and Quiroz, 2015; Gayo et al., 2015; Grosjean et al., 2007;
Marquet et al., 2012; Méndez, 2013; Méndez et al., 2015; Neme
and Gil, 2009). While this combined database does not provide a
continuous spatial cover of the SAAD and its ecotones, it allows a
first exploration of variation of the mid-Holocene archaeological
record in deserts with diverse geographic and ecological features.
These databases were selected because they provide some of the
largest temporal series available for South American deserts and

neighbor areas, and are currently updated. In order to consider
both flanks of the Andes in the three latitudinal bands, we decided
to include the database recently published by Campbell and Quiroz
(2015) for South Central Chile, which lies in a humid setting westwards of the SAAD. This allows for a first step towards integrating
the temporal record from deserts with contiguous ecologic zones.
We include dates ranging between the earliest clearly documented human presence in each region and up to 3000 14C years
BP. This allows assessing the mid-Holocene chronological trends in
a wider temporal frame. With the exception of areas in the high
latitude, 3000 years BP further provides a limit for fully huntergatherer life-ways in most areas comprised by these regions
(Morales et al., 2009). This is important since the key feature of
mobile societies is the relocation of residential camps at different
yearly time scales (Kelly, 1995), thus providing broad comparability of patterns of interaction with the environment. In addition,
3000 years BP sets a limit for the widespread use of other dating
methods, such as thermoluminiscence on pottery, which introduces an additional bias since sample selection and calibration is
not fully comparable to radiocarbon dating (Falabella et al.,
2015). Since these temporal series have already been fully published as sets, we do not reproduce them here. We excluded dates

showing standard deviation larger than 250 years, since they introduce imprecision in the analysis (Jull et al., 2013). On the other
hand, we also excluded dates obtained from marine organisms,
since there is no precision on the magnitude of the ‘‘aging” of the
14C signatures due to local reservoir effects in these different areas
and also through time (Ortlieb et al., 2011). This improves the precision of the analysis, though may certainly introduce some bias in
coastal records. Nevertheless, preliminary comparisons between
time series with and without shell dates at North Central Chile
show that overall trends are not altered, while peaks and troughs
in the radiocarbon record are enhanced when these are excluded
(Méndez et al., 2015). Unless specifically stated otherwise, the
radiocarbon ages mentioned in the text are calibrated and
expressed as years BP.
3.2. Methods
The radiocarbon samples were calibrated with Calib 7.1 (Reimer
et al., 2013), using the calibration curve for the southern hemisphere (SHCal13, Hogg et al., 2013). The basic analytical units in
this paper are the occupational events at the site scale. These
events were calculated by averaging the dates at sites with multiple 14C measurements that are statistically undistinguishable
(Shennan and Edinborough, 2007). Dates were sorted in ascending
order and two or more dates were averaged whenever their differences were not significant (at <0.05) according to a t-test (Ward
and Wilson, 1978). The number of occupational events that results
from these operations must be considered a ‘‘minimum number of
events” (Méndez, 2013; Peros et al., 2010; Wicks and Mithen,
2014).
As a first step, we use summed probability plots at two-sigma
confidence level to assess comparative trends in the different
regions. Then, dates are assigned to 200 years-bins based on their
medians. Following Peros et al. (2010), this bin-size was selected

since it is considerably larger than double the median 14C error
of 64 year for the full dataset (Table 1). The resulting histograms
are plotted with a moving average trend line of 400 years that
helps removing the most important effects of the calibration process, such as artificial troughs associated to the presence of plateaus in the calibration curve (Michczynski and Michczynski,
2006; Williams, 2012).
Taphonomic bias is among the main factors influencing the
results of 14C time series analysis since, other things being equal,
the older an archaeological event is, the less likely it is to be preserved. As Surovell et al. (2009) suggest, this time-dependent
taphonomic destruction may mimic a signal of population growth.
To address this issue we utilize the taphonomic correction equation suggested by Surovell et al. (2009) with the correction introduced by Williams (2012). We do not differentiate samples in
terms of their context (open air vs. shelters). Aiming at an assessment of the changes introduced by the taphonomic correction, we
compare the original and corrected curves.
4. Results
4.1. Macroregional scale
The database is comprised of 914 dates that produce a minimum number of 578 occupation events distributed across the
three latitudinal bands (Table 1). The regions considered here present very different research histories that lead to unequal sampling
intensities. Northern Patagonia, particularly on the western watershed of the Andes, is under-sampled. With this exception, the density of occupational events per km2 is relatively even, with a mean
value of 0.46 event per km2. The standard deviations for the different regions have median values between 50 and 72 years with a
global median for the 578 occupational events of 64 years
(Table 1).

The combined chronological database for the three latitudinal
bands represents a total of ca. 1,236,000 km2, integrating areas
such as the South Central Andes -northern Chile, southern Peru,
and western Bolivia-, Central Argentina and Chile, and northern
Patagonia (Fig. 1). This provides a glimpse of a number of South
American deserts with diverse topographic, climatic, and biogeographic features. In Fig. 5 we present the summed probability
curve for the three latitudinal bands combined, a histogram with
the frequency of dates per time interval of 200 years and a
400 years-moving average, and the frequency of occupation events
corrected for taphonomic destruction (following Williams, 2012).
The earliest widely accepted date for human presence in South
America is 14,600 years BP at Monte Verde II (Dillehay, 1997),
included here in the high latitudes assemblage. This initial human
signal is not repeated in other areas of the SAAD. The most widespread human presence appears consistently at 13,000 years BP
and generates an initial peak in the time-series, lending support
for the existence of demographically viable hunter-gatherer populations (Méndez, 2013; Steele and Politis, 2009) in the SAAD. This
early peak should be regarded with caution in view of a possible
bias towards dating the first human appearances in stratified sites.
During the early Holocene, variable increases in dates produce a
series of peaks that are different for each latitudinal band herein
discussed. The early troughs recorded at high latitudes of the SAAD

should also be treated with caution, since they are likely artifact of
low research intensity.
The beginning of the mid-Holocene at 9000–8500 years BP is
marked by an augment in the density of the probability curve,
and then followed by two distinct troughs occurring respectively
between ca. 7600–7200 and 6600–6400 years BP, separated by a
period of intense density of summed probabilities between 7200
and 6600 years BP (Fig. 5). Overall, this temporal structure is replicated in the different analyses conducted: summed probability
(Fig. 5a), frequency of dates per 200 years intervals and 400 years
moving average (Fig. 5b), and frequency of dates corrected for
taphonomic destruction (Fig. 5c). The only noteworthy difference
is observable between the series corrected for taphonomic destruction against the others, since the correction increases the intensity
of the signal during the Early Holocene to levels that are similar to
those recorded for the late Holocene.
4.2. Regional scale
In Figs. 6–8 we present the time series for the low latitudes
(16°–25°S), mid latitudes (29°–35°S), and high latitudes
(35°–41°S) databases respectively.
Despite minor differences, the structure of the mid-Holocene
probability curves is remarkably similar in the three latitudinal

bands of the SAAD, as can be seen in the summed probabilities, the
frequencies of minimal occupational events, and the 400 yearsmoving average lines, which would soften peaks and troughs. This
overall similarity includes an increase in the signal at the beginning of the mid-Holocene that is followed by the two troughs
referred above for the full dataset (Fig. 5). This is most visible in
the mid (Fig. 7) and high latitudes (Fig. 8), where the temporal signal is fully interrupted at times. In the case of the low latitudes
band (Fig. 6), the troughs are still present, tough in a less marked
fashion (Fig. 6).
The series based on the data corrected for taphonomic destruction homogenize the time series for the full dataset, as well as for
the individual latitudinal bands, by producing an increase in the
intensity of the signal for the early Holocene when compared to
the late Holocene. Interestingly, the mid-Holocene troughs are still
recorded in these corrected series.

5. Discussion
5.1. Alternative explanations for the temporal patterns
When attempting to extract information on intensity of human
occupations to infer aspects of paleodemography, we face three
main sources of bias: sampling limitations, taphonomic destruction, and artificial products of the calibration curve (Campbell
and Quiroz, 2015; Gayo et al., 2015; Méndez et al., 2015;
Shennan et al., 2013; Williams, 2012).
Biases stemming from deficiencies in sampling can be minimized by zooming out and increasing spatial scale. In the three
regions considered here, teams with diverse research traditions,
aims, and field sampling strategies have produced the radiocarbon
record during the last decades, minimizing systematic bias due to
research decisions and contributing to provide an averaged

chronological signature for the macro-region. We do not consider
that research decisions would have the capacity to artificially produce the troughs recorded on a macro-regional scale.
We cover a region large and diverse enough to include multiple
taphonomic modes that would not have been affected by sources
of taphonomic bias acting in a similar fashion, so as to produce
taphonomic biases at a macro-regional level.
In addition, the presence of an intense -though variable- early
Holocene signal in association to different taphonomic modes from
the three latitudinal bands weakens taphonomy as the main explanation for the mid-Holocene patterns recorded.
Admittedly, the series corrected for taphonomic destruction
provide only a preliminary assessment, since we have not discriminated samples in terms of their context of deposition (open air vs.
sheltered sites). In the three regions, it is evident that the correction produces an over-representation of the early Holocene record,
which shows levels comparable to the late Holocene, a consideration that is not supported by quantitative nor qualitative data from
these regions. This would be due to the inclusion of the samples
coming from rock shelters and caves, indicating that an assumption of time-dependent taphonomic loss may not be valid for samples deposited in these contexts (see Goldberg et al., 2016;
Williams, 2012), at least as modeled by the correction equation.
Interestingly, the mid-Holocene troughs are not obscured by the
likely artificial changes introduced by the taphonomic correction
to the early Holocene section of the curve, remaining as distinctive
low points within the series. We suggest that this highlights the
robustness of the pattern in the full dataset of the SAAD and in
the three individual regions.
Properties inherent to the southern hemisphere calibration
curve may produce ‘artificial’ outcomes in the summed probabilities, biasing the macro-regional temporal patterns. Steep segments
of the calibration curve for the southern hemisphere (Hogg et al.,
2013) produce artificial concentration of dates within certain time

R. Barberena et al. / Journal of Anthropological Archaeology 46 (2017) 68–81

periods that simulate temporal peaks, while plateaus in the calibration curve may produce troughs in the temporal series
(Michczynski and Michczynski, 2006; Prates et al., 2013). Due to
their susceptibility to methodological factors, we do not give
accentuated peaks a role in the development of our discussion.
By augmenting analytical scale, the use of the 200 years-intervals
coupled with a 400 years-moving average minimizes the incidence
of these effects (Williams, 2012). Importantly, the mid-Holocene
troughs are recorded in the different analyses applied to the temporal data. In addition, we refer to the thorough analysis published
by Gayo et al. (2015) for the calibration curve of the southern
hemisphere showing that, when calibrating samples at twosigma, there are no major plateaus in the mid-Holocene, as
opposed to two significant ones detected between 5381–4973
and 4675–4207 years BP (Gayo et al., 2015, Table S4). In addition,
there is no overlap between steep sections of the calibration curve
with the areas of high density of summed probability in the plot for
the SAAD during the mid-Holocene (Gayo et al., 2015, Table S5). In
sum, the temporal tendencies recorded for the mid-Holocene in
the three latitudinal bands of the SAAD would not be an artifact
of the calibration process.
As already mentioned, the degree of consistency in the patterns
recorded across regions with diverse taphonomic modes and
research histories do not lend support to taphonomy or sampling
decisions as the main source for this pattern. On this basis, we suggest that the main troughs recorded for the mid-Holocene represent periods of decreased human occupation in multiple regions
of the SAAD and neighbor ecological zones (among others, see
Araujo et al., 2005–2006; Gil et al., 2005; Goldberg et al., 2016).
5.2. Climate change and landscape fragmentation in macro-regional
scale
In the context of considerable spatial and temporal variation,
the paleoecological information reviewed above suggests the predominance of dry conditions during the mid-Holocene in large
parts of the SAAD. This is particularly clear in the records from
the low (Fig. 6) and mid latitudes (Fig. 7), with periods characterized as ‘extremely dry’ on the basis of several proxies (Grosjean
et al., 2007; Latorre et al., 2003; Maldonado and Villagrán, 2006;
Maldonado et al., 2005), while the fragmentary information available for northern Patagonia (Fig. 8) indicates the establishment of a
well-defined west-to-east humidity and vegetation gradient developed eastward of the Andes since the late Pleistocene-early Holocene (Iglesias et al., 2014; Markgraf et al., 2009; Whitlock et al.,
2006). It is also evidently clear that, despite the existence of predominantly arid conditions, humid pulses of varying extent and
intensity also characterized the mid-Holocene across the latitudinal range considered (Bobst et al., 2001; Grosjean et al., 2003).
The exploratory nature of this paper, plus the large scale of analysis
utilized, prevent us from attempting to correlate temporal trends
in the archaeological record with paleoclimatic proxies in a high
temporal resolution. Rather, we are interested in exploring the
effects of enhanced and prolonged aridity on resource availability
for human populations.
Different proxies from the three latitudinal bands indicate that
enhanced aridity in these already dry settings would have produced an increase in landscape fragmentation, expressed as large
parts of the landscape taking the character of temporary or continuous barriers for humans (Veth, 1989). The persistence of arid conditions in annual, decennial, and centennial time scales would
produce a progressive desiccation of the landscape with cumulative consequences for forager societies (Marsh et al., in press).
The occurrence of short wetter pulses interspersed between dry
periods would ameliorate, but not reverse, prevailing ecological
conditions. The barrier-character implies infrequent human use

77

associated to elevated risks involved in traversing or occupying
dry and unpredictable areas (Fitzhugh et al., 2011; Mandryk,
1993). In ecologically extreme cases, this could also produce the
abandonment of large regions (Gil, 2006; Manning and Timpson,
2014; Núñez et al., 2002; Schlanger and Wilshusen, 1993).
5.3. Refugia in archaeological scale
There is abundant paleoecological and archaeological evidence
for the existence of favored tracts of the landscape of the SAAD
during the mid-Holocene. These may be considered analogous to
Veth’s (1989) ‘islands in the interior’ of the Australian Desert,
Yacobaccio’s (1994) ‘zones of nutrient concentration’ of northwestern Argentina, or Núñez et al. (1999) ‘opportunistic refugia’ of Atacama. We explore a few cases that play a qualitative role in our
argument, by indicating places that may have had a key role in
terms of demographic persistence (Smith, 1989) and, in some
cases, socio-economic change. These cases can be considered
potential refugia during the mid-Holocene, and may have acted
as buffer zones allowing to cope with the higher risks that prevailed during adverse climatic pulses (Lanata and Borrero, 1994).
In the low latitudes of the South Central Andes, some tracts of
the Pacific coast did not only have continuous human occupation,
but also experienced demographic growth and social elaboration
leading to the astounding Chinchorro cultural complex (Arriaza
et al., 2005). As Marquet et al. (2012:14756) indicate, ‘‘the resulting
[temporal] curve indicates that human populations increased dramatically at 7 ka BP and peaked by 6 ka BP”. This demographic
node is associated with a process of economic intensification based
on marine foods (Santoro et al., 2012).
Also located in the low latitudes band, high areas of the Puna
plateau presented scattered oases-like settings in association to
springs or river valleys (Latorre et al., 2006; Ledru et al., 2013;
Núñez et al., 1999; Yacobaccio, 2013). Núñez et al. (1999, 2002)
acknowledged these contexts first at the Puripica locality in northern Chile, where water availability was controlled by local factors.
Recent interdisciplinary research suggests that these settings experienced the first experiments of guanaco (Lama guanicoe) ‘herd protecting strategies’ leading to domestication (Cartajena et al., 2007;
Yacobaccio, 2004). Based on extensive Andean databases,
Yacobaccio and Vilá (2013) suggest that this process should be
framed as a trajectory of gradual economic intensification on wild
camelid populations in the context of reduced residential mobility.
In the mid latitudes-band, we have the record of the Tagua
Tagua wetlands in Central Chile (34°S), which remained as a key
and persistent wetland ecosystem during mid-Holocene (ValeroGarcés et al., 2005). Yielding an initial occupation at 13,000 years
BP (Núñez et al., 1994), the most redundant archaeological assemblages in the Tagua Tagua area appear to be of mid-Holocene age.
Though only published on a preliminary basis, this locality is
known to present a mortuary record indicative of recurrent human
burial in particular sites, such as Cuchipuy and Santa Inés, during
the mid-Holocene (Jackson et al., 2012; Kaltwasser et al., 1983).
The Cuchipuy site is a key early burial and residential site in Central Chile showing a minimum number of ca. 50 individuals (E.
Aspillaga, pers. comm. to C. Méndez, 2015) excavated on a continuous stratigraphic feature contained between ca. 8000 and
5800 years BP (Jackson et al., 2012; D. Jackson, unpublished data;
Kaltwasser et al., 1983). The archaeological record at this particular
ecological site suggests the attraction and role of stable freshwater
resources, a suggestion that is substantiated by preliminary stable
isotope determinations for the site (Sanhueza and Falabella, 2010).
Summing up, despite their different ecological and historical
dynamics, low-latitude localities, such as coastal Atacama and
some Puna oases, and mid-latitude contexts, such as the Tagua
Tagua wetlands, preserve an intense and unique mid-Holocene sig-

78

R. Barberena et al. / Journal of Anthropological Archaeology 46 (2017) 68–81

nal with behaviors suggestive of reduced mobility and incipient
economic intensification that is based in different sets of resources.
In the macro-regional context of aridity and increasing landscape
fragmentation that is indicated for segments of the midHolocene, these localities can be satisfactorily conceived as refugia.
Some of these refugia witnessed initial processes of economic
intensification during the mid-Holocene, such as marine specialization in the Chinchorro complex of northern Chile (Marquet
et al., 2012; Santoro et al., 2012) and camelid herd-protecting
strategies ultimately leading to llamas (Lama glama) and alpacas
(Vicugna pacos) in the South Central Andes (Cartajena et al.,
2007; Stahl, 2008; Yacobaccio and Vilá, 2013). The mid-latitudes
in Central Chile may have witnessed human adaptations emphasizing low mobility and broad-spectrum diets focused on wetland
resources.
5.4. Is spatial relocation/reorganization a sufficient explanation for the
mid-Holocene record? A demographic hypothesis
The primary mechanism that mobile societies employ to cope
with increasing aridity and landscape fragmentation would be spatial and/or organizational rearrangements. Depending on human
decisions, these spatial changes may take the form of increased
residential and/or logistical mobility (Binford, 1991; Veth, 2005)
or decreased residential mobility and tethering to favored locales
(Garvey, 2008). An enlargement of logistical mobility circuits
may also complement the second option (Goñi, 2000). However,
ecological and demographic conditions may limit the capacity of
these spatial mechanisms to overcome landscape fragmentation.
The key issues would be the extent of landscape fragmentation
produced by persistent aridity, or the amount of space that takes
the character of barriers for humans (Smith, 2013; Veth, 1989;
Williams et al., 2013), the carrying capacity of environments suitable for human use, which could be realized by means of economic
intensification, and the availability of adequate information and
technology enabling it.
As presented in Figs. 6–8 the structure of the time series for the
three latitudinal bands is remarkably similar, showing a robust
increase in the signal at the beginning of the mid-Holocene, ca.
8000–7600 years BP, followed by two troughs respectively at ca.
7600–7200 and 6800–6400 years BP. The first trough, in particular,
indicates the minima in the intensity of the temporal signal in the
three latitudinal bands of the SAAD. Accepting the limitations of
the currently available database, its spatial scale that covers
1,236,000 km2 is an important asset. The concurrence in the timing of the two troughs described, plus their macro-regional spatial
scale, lead us to suggest that besides spatial mechanisms of coping
with risk, the mid-Holocene record of the SAAD would indicate a
large-scale demographic decrease. Recent research by Goldberg
et al. (2016, 234) at the scale of South America, with a focus that
is not restricted to deserts, suggests that ‘‘. . . population density
during the mid-Holocene is in the lower range of estimates for
the density of worldwide hunter-gatherer populations”. In addition
to a decrease in presumable numbers of people, the archaeological
record also suggests a ‘contraction of range’, or space that is systematically occupied by human populations, as the occupational
histories of several regions indicate (Barberena, 2015; Núñez
et al., 2002; Méndez et al., 2015).
In sum, the combination of two macro-regional troughs occurring at roughly the same periods –though with different intensity
– in the three latitudinal bands of the SAAD (low abundance), the
absence or near absence of human occupation in several tracts of
the SAAD (contraction of range), plus the record of relatively fast
increases in the temporal signal following the troughs, make an
excellent case for the existence of population bottleneck(s) in the SAAD
during the mid-Holocene.

The bottleneck scenario implies a release or demographic
expansion stage following the trough. We consider that this
dynamic provides a mechanism that may explain several demographic, economic, and social processes observed after 6000 years
BP. The end of the mid-Holocene is marked by a temporal signal
that is more intense and continuous than ever before. So far, this
macro-regional pattern has been described rather than explained.
The expansion mechanisms involved in a bottleneck may contribute to explain these demographic changes at an appropriate
spatial scale (Ambrose, 1998; Bennett and Provan, 2008; Sundell
et al., 2014). Goldberg et al. (2016, 234) have suggested that the
post mid-Holocene record shows exponential demographic growth
that would be associated to ‘‘the shift to a predominantly sedentary and agricultural subsistence . . . between 5.5 ka and 3.5 ka”,
akin to the demographic transition characteristic of the European
Neolithic. While this explanation may account for a fraction of
the late Holocene processes of demographic growth, it seems unlikely that it accounts for the full range of processes recorded in
South America, particularly if we consider that large parts of the
continent did not experience a transition to productive economies
until ca. 2000–1000 years BP (e.g., Gil et al., 2014). In addition,
other regions that would display a pattern of post mid-Holocene
exponential demographic growth, such as the high latitudes band
discussed here, plus other areas further south, did not witness
the shift to productive economies nor sedentary organization
whatsoever (Morales et al., 2009; Morello et al., 2012). In synthesis,
we suggest that the release following the alleged mid-Holocene
bottleneck(s) and the demographic transition associated to
reduced mobility (as suggested by Goldberg et al., 2016) provide
complementary mechanisms to account for the late Holocene
archaeological record of South America.

6. Conclusions and perspectives
Building on previous research in smaller scales (Gayo et al.,
2015; Grosjean et al., 2007; Marquet et al., 2012; Méndez et al.,
2015; Neme and Gil, 2009), we have assembled and compared
paleoecological data and archaeological time series for three latitudinal bands of the SAAD from 16° to 41°S. Diverse proxies suggest
the existence of arid and extremely arid conditions in large parts of
the SAAD, though not in a synchronous fashion. We have identified
a number of archaeological patterns that are recorded on a macroregional scale of analysis: a robust increase in the temporal signal
at the beginning of the mid-Holocene (ca. 8000–7600 years BP) followed by two troughs (ca. 7600–7200, 6800–6400 years BP). The
first trough indicates the minima in the intensity of human occupation in the three latitudinal bands. Though causal relations are
far from clear, these mid-Holocene events provide the context for
the initiation of independent trajectories of economic intensification based on different sets of resources -marine foods, camelids,
and probably wetland resources-, some of which lead to domestication processes. These cases occur in regions that can be conceived as refugia during arid periods of the mid-Holocene, and
would share a tendency towards reduced residential mobility
(Dillehay, 2014). On the basis of this review, we formalized a
demographic working hypothesis at a macro-regional scale, which
suggests the existence of mid-Holocene population bottleneck(s)
at a macro-regional scale. Though not conclusive, the temporal evidence presented fits well with this suggestion, providing an explanation not only for the occupational troughs, but also for the post6000 years BP record of intense and relatively rapid population
growth observed in many regions of the SAAD, and in South America in general (Goldberg et al., 2016). There is no conclusive evidence regarding the presence of biological discontinuities
between populations before and after the mid-Holocene. While

R. Barberena et al. / Journal of Anthropological Archaeology 46 (2017) 68–81

this is not part of our current focus, we would tentatively favor an
option of biological continuity from a restricted genetic pool modified by random processes.
The spatial scope of the data presented in this paper provides
the chance of disentangling processes of spatial re-localization
from actual changes in population size. At this exploratory stage
of analysis, we are more concerned in presenting a framework with
the capacity to guide research on a macro-regional scale, rather
than in probing the hypothesis presented. This analysis produces
testable expectations at different analytical scales and for different
research domains. At a regional scale, work in some of the proposed refugia would be paramount, particularly in the underresearched wetlands of Central Chile (other regions, such as the
mesic steppes or the Atlantic coast in northern Patagonia, also hold
this potential). The existence of parallel trajectories towards
reduced residential mobility should be assessed in a comparative
frame. While some of the regions that may have acted as geographical barriers have been thoroughly surveyed, such as parts of the
Atacama Desert and southern Mendoza Province, many have not.
This should also be the focus of systematic regional work targeting
the mid-Holocene period (Garvey, 2012; Durán et al., in press).
This research produces expectations for human genomic and
morphometric evidence. There is a robust body of theoretical and
empirical DNA research that focuses in assessing the role of population bottlenecks in human history (Excoffier et al., 2009; Sundell
et al., 2014), as well as the incidence of random (genetic drift) and
selective processes leading to specific relations between genetic
and phenotypic features in human populations from South America (Perez et al., 2009). Deciphering the behavioral, demographic,
and evolutionary meaning of archaeological discontinuities
requires a continental scope.
Setting issues of historical and ecological scale aside, we consider that there is a similitude in the conceptual structure of the
debates on the socio-demographic meaning of temporal discontinuities across the southern continents, including the Last Glacial
Maximum in the Australian and African deserts (Barham and
Mitchell, 2008; Mitchell, 2017; Smith, 2013; Veth et al., 2005,
2017; Williams et al., 2013). These issues hold a great comparative
potential at different scales, including an intercontinental level. We
will learn a great deal from a comparative take on this matter.
