Fire has shaped the environment and has been important for human cultural development. In this paper, we
propose to study past ﬁre events using ecological modelling. For instance, the ecology of ﬁre can help us to
understand and interpret archaeological problems related to past settlement patterns or environmental scenarios. Variation in ﬁre regimens are related to both, vegetation and precipitation ﬂuctuations. Recently, we
have model past ecosystem dynamics using remote sensing in the Ambato Valley (Catamarca NW Argentina)
ranging from 442 to 1998 CE. Our aim here is to use remotely sensed vegetation data to enhance our understanding of environmental disturbance in the period 2000–2011. We characterised the spatial-time dynamics of
the annual NDVI as an indicator of vegetation functioning. Then we related the NDVI dynamics to precipitation
and ﬁre events in an arid highland environment in the area. Further, we analysed the vegetation data (monthly
NDVI, MODIS/TERRA satellite, 1km2 pixels), and the climate data: annual precipitation. Then we calculated the
NDVI annual average of every pixel and the NDVI anomalies of every year over the studied period. Lastly, we
related NDVI data with annual precipitation and compared the NDVIs prior to and after known ﬁre events in this
period. On a spatial scale, the results show that the NDVI values were (a) low in shrublands and in cultivated
areas, (b) medium in grasslands and piedmont forest with anthropic impact, and (c) high in highland forests.
Within the studied time-period, extreme positive and negative anomalies were detected. The precipitation interannual variations were greater than the NDVI inter-annual variations, thus demonstrating that in some areas of
the valley the horizontal precipitation can make important contributions to the ecosystem humidity. Extreme
negative anomalies were observed the year of ﬁre and ﬁre scars at least for the next two years. These results
demonstrate the relation between structure and function of vegetation, precipitation and ﬁre. Understanding
these relations can enable us to explain results when hindcasting (“predicting” what happened during past
episodes of climate change) palaeoenvironmental conditions and ﬁre events, thus helping us to interpret different archaeological contexts related to ﬁre events.

1. Introduction
During the last couple of years, we have worked with palaeoenvironmental reconstructions in the Ambato Valley, Catamarca Province,
northwestern Argentina (Lindskoug, 2010; Lindskoug, 2014;

Marconetto et al., 2014; Marconetto et al., 2015). At the same time, an
ethnographical work about the perception of climate and ethnometeorology was published (Bussi, 2015). We initiated these studies because of the necessity to understand the environmental context of past
populations in the inhabited area. Archaeological evidence shows that
the earliest occupations of the area took place during the Formative
Period at the beginning of the ﬁrst millennium. Settlement data seems

to climatic variations; not only that, but also the ecosystem functioning
usually has a more rapid response in time than it does in structure.
Therefore, the use of functional attributes represents a clear advantage
to the characterisation of ecosystems into bio zones (Paruelo et al.,
1998). An additional beneﬁt is that functional attributes can be monitored through satellite data (Malingreau, 1986) which apart from exploring the vegetation dynamics, help describe the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystems. Moreover, D'Antoni and Spanner (1993) used
satellite images to build models for paleoecology. Time series of continuous earth surface observations based on vegetation estimates have
also signiﬁcantly improved the comprehension of plant variation from a
regional to a global scale (Fensholt et al., 2009; Schucknecht et al.,
2013). They allow monitoring the ecosystem dynamics.

to indicate that the area had been continuously occupied until around
900–1000 according to AMS dating (Marconetto et al., 2014), which
corresponds to the Regional Integration Period and the last phase of
Aguada occupation in the area. Several of the archaeological sites in the
area, Iglesia de Los Indios, Martínez 2 and Piedras Blancas, associated
to the Aguada Culture, indicated a rapid abandonment as a result of ﬁre
events (Gastaldi, 2010; Laguens, 2006; Lindskoug, 2016a; Lindskoug,
2016b; Marconetto and Gordillo, 2008). The ﬁrst palaeoenvironmental
studies had indicated a possible drought at the end of the occupation of
the area by the Aguada culture at the end of the ﬁrst millennium
(Marconetto, 2009; Marconetto, 2010). These evidence led us to initiate
studies about past ﬁre regimes in the area (Lindskoug, 2010; Lindskoug,
2014; Lindskoug, 2016a; Lindskoug, 2016b; Lindskoug and Marconetto,
2014), to analyse whether the abandonment of the valley in the last
phase of the Aguada occupation was related to forest ﬁres. Further, we
also applied a method to analyse the past vegetation based on an ecosystem-process model (D'Antoni, 2006; Marconetto et al., 2015) called
Hindcasting Ecosystems Model (HEMO). This model uses Normalised
Diﬀerence Vegetation Indexes (NDVI) to make retrodictions about past
vegetation patterns in the Late Holocene. The HEMO is a model that
employs non-linear methods, like the Artiﬁcial Neural Network, built
from a training model with modern NDVI and growth ring data or some
other annual resolution proxy. The NDVI is calculated from spectroscopic satellite data. Satellites orbiting the earth get periodical data,
available at open databases such as NOAA, NASA, thus obtaining time
series. The NDVI is related to the vegetation cover and productivity,
and indirectly, to precipitation, temperature, drainage, mineralogical
composition and soil biota, and to all those factors that determine the
vegetation status. Time series from NDVI data allow supervising the
ecosystem dynamics. Then, from the training model, the retrodiction of
old-time NDVI (paleo-NDVI) at an annual resolution is done, employing
the training model and the growth rings belonging to the period to be
retrodicted.
Thus, the HEMO permits the estimation of the vegetation status and
the variations suﬀered in the past. Those changes can be compared with
other contemporaneous environmental factors. The HEMO has already
retrodicted the paleo-NDVI of the Ambato having obtained the ﬁrst
results for the period 442–1998 CE. It also detected great intensity
paleo-NDVI ﬂuctuation periods in the V and XV centuries. Furthermore,
the model proved to be sensitive to global-scale phenomena, such as the
Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm Period Valley (Burry et al., 2017;
Marconetto et al., 2015).
In this paper, we aim to characterise the spatial distribution and the
annual dynamics of the NDVI (period 2000–2011) in a highland forest
environment northwest of Argentina and to relate the NDVI dynamics
with precipitation and ﬁre events to see possible patterns, which can
help to understand the ecology of ﬁre in the area. The knowledge of the
modern ecosystem dynamics will let improve our description of the
vegetation-precipitation-ﬁre relationship of the area, which will eventually lead to the posing of more precise palaeoenvironmental inferences.
The application of this in the ﬁeld of environmental archaeology can
help us to understand the palaeoenvironmental context of the past
Aguada society in the area and can be used in other areas with similar
environmental conditions to analyse past societies from diﬀerent angles.

1.2. NDVI
The Normalised Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI) is related to
plant cover and the vigour and productivity of vegetation while time
series permit the monitoring of the ecosystem dynamics. Time and
space variations of the plant photosynthetic activity have close relation
with the soil water availability, especially in arid to sub-humid ecosystems (Fabricante et al., 2009; Iglesias et al., 2010; Ji and Peters,
2003; Justice et al., 1985; Nicholson et al., 1990; Tucker et al., 1985).
However, the warmer temperatures of the growing season increase the
plant productivity in cold environments (Srur et al., 2011). In this
sense, NDVI time series have been compared to climatic variable time
series, with the aim of exploring correspondences between geophysical
elements and variations of the green index (Herrmann et al., 2005;
Hickler et al., 2005; Xiao and Moody, 2005).
1.3. Precipitation
Diverse authors have found a connection between the mean annual
precipitation and the spatial variations of NDVI on a regional level
(Lauenroth, 1979; Le Houérou, 1984; McNaughton, 1985); however,
time patterns could be explained not only by precipitation but also by a
set of factors (Jobbágy et al., 2002; Lauenroth and Sala, 1992; Le
Houérou et al., 1988). Therefore, the NDVI time dynamic behave in a
complex manner seemingly either because of the vegetation memory or
because of the inertia with regard to previous precipitation periods
(Nicholson et al., 1990; Oesterheld et al., 2001; Ogle and Reynolds,
2004; Wiegand et al., 2004).
1.4. Fire
Moreover, ﬁre is also a factor that controls the vegetation dynamics
and it frequently aﬀects forest-shrubby/herbaceous ecotonal areas
(Bond and van Wilgen, 1996). In addition, ﬁre aﬀects the increasing or
decreasing woody biomass within a landscape (Murphy et al., 2014).
Fire regimes are inﬂuenced by both climatic factors controlling the fuel
production and human activity (Bond and van Wilgen, 1996; Grau and
Veblen, 2000). The vegetation vigour and the hydric state of fuels can
determine the ignition probability, conditioning to some extent the
propagation of ﬁre (Burgan et al., 1998). In mesic forests, ﬁre is more
frequent during continuous dry periods that can last from less than a
year to many decades. In contrast, in relatively dry forests, ﬁre can be
limited by shortage of ﬁne fuel. Moreover, ﬁre occurrence often increases a year or a few years after above-average moisture availability
(Grau and Veblen, 2000). By allowing the monitoring of vegetation
conditions at a regional scale, the NDVI data can detect ﬁre events that
have already occurred and provides an insight into the potential risks of
ﬁre (Zipoli et al., 2000).

1.1. Ecosystems
Understanding of the environmental disturbance impact over a region requires of a characterisation of the vegetation state. Ecosystems
can be characterised either by their structural or by functional parameters. The characterisation of an ecosystem by their structural parameters alone shows some deﬁciencies, for example the inertia of the
vegetation structure can defer the perception of the ecosystem response
to a disturbance (Milchunas and Lauenroth, 1995) or to changes related

1.5. Archaeology and ﬁre

Lindskoug and Marconetto, 2014). We could determine that ﬁre was an
integral part of the landscape before human occupation. The sampled
stations demonstrated a varying pattern of ﬁre regimes in the Ambato
Valley. It could also be determined that the landscape in some ways
must have been shaped by these ﬁre regimes. The analysed stations
showed that ﬁre was recurrent and was part of the ecosystem in the
area, and that during the occupation of the valley there were several
ﬂuctuations throughout time (Lindskoug, 2016a).
The conditions for ﬁres were present in the Ambato Valley. Ignition
sources existed, both natural, in the form of lightning strikes, and anthropogenic. Increasing human activity in the area would have made
the anthropogenic sources increasingly common. In the case of the
Ambato Valley, there is high biomass availability, with a dominance of
forest on the valley ﬂoor and on the lower hillsides, while higher up on
the hillsides grasslands dominate. The natural vegetation must have
been a highly available source of fuel for the ﬁres, with all of the different fuel sizes present in our study area: ﬁne, medium, and coarse.
Some areas, especially the grasslands higher up on the slopes, have
abundant ﬁne-sized fuel and are therefore highly ﬂammable. In these
areas, ﬁre would have spread very quickly. The climatic conditions
must have increased the risk of ﬁre immensely, especially since there
was a drought in the ﬁnal phase of the occupation. Although low precipitation during drought does not increase the biomass (fuel load), it
aﬀects the available fuel in the area by causing the vegetation to grow
slowly. However, drought also aﬀects fuel availability by making the
existing biomass drier, so the total available fuel in the area increases. If
wetter years were present prior to the drought detected in the ﬁnal
phase, there would have been a larger accumulation of biomass and an
increased amount of fuel in the area. When a ﬁre hit it could have been
devastating because of this large biomass build-up. Regular ﬁres are
necessary to prevent large biomass accumulations that can later create

provide speciﬁc clues as to why sites or even regions were abandoned.
Microcharcoal extracted from sedimentary sequences or sampled from
archaeological sites can give us information on biomass burning and
can be used as an indicator of past ﬁre events. Marlon et al. (2008) have
stated that ´ﬁre is a key earth system process aﬀecting ecosystems, landsurface properties, the carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry, aerosols
and human activities.’ In some cases, ﬁre can be seen as a transformer
on a social-cultural level in society, as in the case of diﬀerent resources
such as food; also, in the burning of the dead in death rituals, and, most
importantly, as will be discussed in this paper, as a transformer of the
surrounding environment. Verhoeven (2000) has argued for close links
among death rituals, ﬁre, and abandonment as transformers of both
human and material life in Neolithic sites in the Near East. According to
him, ritual practises of intentionally burnt settlements can be associated
with mortuary rituals in the area, and a posterior abandonment of the
settlement. Ethnographical evidence of ﬁre associated to rituals and
house abandonment after someone passed away exists for Amazonas
and the Chaco area (Kopenawa and Albert, 2013; Tola, 2006). In these
cases, ﬁre is seen as a kind of puriﬁcation. It is also possible that ﬁres
could have covered up traces of abandonment patterns as has been
discussed in the case of our study area (Lindskoug, 2016a; Lindskoug,
2016b).
1.6. Traces of ﬁre in the Ambato Valley
Our earlier studies in the area had conﬁrmed important information
about the ecology of ﬁre in the Ambato Valley. To study the past ﬁre
regimens in the area 17 locations were sampled in the valley. Two
hundred and ﬁfteen sediment samples were analysed for microcharcoal
showing that since at least 4500 BP the area had been regularly aﬀected
by ﬁre, according to 10 AMS dates obtained (Lindskoug, 2016a;
749

valley's occupation was ﬁrst dated to around 1000 ± 100 CE (Gordillo,
2005; Marconetto, 2007). However, new analysis and calibration of the
radiocarbon dates has established that the event most probably took
place no later than 900 CE (Marconetto et al., 2014). We based this
interpretation not just on the radiocarbon dates, but also mainly on the
stratigraphic relationships between diﬀerent objects in settlement units
at the Piedras Blancas site.

extensive ﬁres with great intensity and severity. All this evidence led us
to further investigate the past and present ﬁre regimens in the area.
2. Study area
2.1. Natural environment
The Argentine north-west is characterised by arid environments,
which evidence low-dynamic ecosystemic processes and a highly variable productivity in time and space (Iglesias et al., 2010; Noy-Meir,
1973; Noy-Meir, 1985). Within this area and under the inﬂuence of an
arid climate the Ambato Valley is located in a highland environment
made up of sub-parallel belts (Difrieri, 1958). This valley is located in
the province of Catamarca (Argentina) and is situated between 27°54′
to 28°03′S and 65°45′to 65°55′W forming part of Río Los Puestos basin.
The valley lies in the Sierras Pampeanas, a highland environment and
limits with the summits of Sierra de Humaya to the west and Graciana
Balcozna to the east (Fig. 1). The precipitation regime varies from 500
to 800 annual mm and most of the rain falls in summer (October
through March), with a mean temperature of 24–26 °C in the warmest
month and 8–10 °C in the coldest month (De la Orden and Quiroga,
1997; Palmieri et al., 2005). The elevation and exposure of the slopes
furnish the diﬀerent sectors with climatic peculiarities.
As for the phytogeographic characterisation, the Ambato Valley,
belongs to the Monte Province (xerophytic shrubland) (Cabrera, 1976).
The valley is located in a transition zone leading to the Chaqueña
Province (xerophilous forest); it limits to the west with the Prepuneña
Province (xerophytic shrubland with cacti) and to the northeast and
east with the Yunga (Subtropical Montane Cloud Forest), which receives water not only from rainfall but also from fog precipitation, the
so-called ‘horizontal precipitation’. The particular situation of the
valley, in close contact with diﬀerent phytogeographic regions, allows
it to hold representative species of every region with noticeable differences among slopes (Marconetto, 2008). Within this frame, De la
Orden and Quiroga (1997) have established diﬀerent vegetation units
(Fig. 2 and Table 1). Each vegetation unit is deﬁned by the altitudinal
variable and the ﬂoristic composition. The vegetation close to the river
comprises the units/area most exploited by the past population. Several
wildland ﬁres have hit the area, including an extensive ﬁre in December
2009. The ﬁre started in an eastern valley parallel to Ambato Valley,
ran down Sierra Graciana Balcozna and it propagated southwards
(Lindskoug, 2016a).

3. Materials and methods
3.1. Vegetation data
We worked with monthly NDVI data from the time record of the
spectrometer MODIS, TERRA (code: MOD13A3). We used images
1 km2 pixels (years 2000 to 2011) from the Ambato Valley (http://
LPDAAC.usgs.gov).
3.2. Precipitation data
Due to the absence of climatic data for the Ambato Valley, we used
annual precipitation data from the Estación Aero Catamarca (28°28′S,
65°47′W) at 50 km south of the valley issued by the National
Meteorological Service (SMN).
3.3. Data analysis
NDVI monthly data were averaged to obtain the annual NDVI
(NDVIa) for every pixel, where a = 2000 to 2011.
3.3.1. Spatial scale
We calculated for every pixel the average NDVI for the period
2000–2011 (NDVIp), where p = period 2000–2011, with the aid of the
programme GRASS (2012). From the resulting data, an NDVIp map was
made.
3.3.2. Time scale
For every pixel, the diﬀerence between NDVIa and NDVIp was calculated for every year: NDVId = NDVIa − NDVIp.
Then, the standard deviation (sd) for each year and for every pixel
was calculated.
With the aim of visualizing the magnitude of the deviations of the
NDVIa, anomalies were calculated. The anomalies are deviations from
the NDVI values of a period with respect to an average value of a reference period (López et al., 1991), represented here by the ratio
NDVId/sd.
Maps of the anomalies from the Ambato Valley (period 2000–2011)
were made with the QGIS software (2014). The following scale of deviations was used: extreme positive anomaly (NDVIa > 2sd), medium
positive
anomaly
(1sd ≤ NDVIa ≤ 2sd),
no
anomaly
(− 1sd ≤ NDVIa ≤ 1sd), medium negative anomaly (−2sd ≤
NDVIa ≤ −1sd) and extreme negative anomaly (NDVIa < −2sd)
(Britos and Basconcelo, 2012).
Correlations between the NDVIa of each pixel and the annual precipitation both of the same year and the three previous years were
done: (0), (−1), (−2) and (−3) for the year, one, two and three years
earlier, respectively. A map was made that shows pixels with the largest
correlations between NDVIa and precipitation of the year and the three
lag years. The NDVIa – precipitation correlation coeﬃcient (r2) was
calculated.

2.2. The archaeological landscape in the Ambato Valley
> 700 archaeological sites, including agricultural terraces and
structures for animal herding and settlement units, have been recorded
in the Ambato Valley, around 130 of which are settlement units. Most of
the residential units are found on the ﬂuvial plain, between the ﬁrst and
second terraces of the Los Puestos River, between approximately 1050
and 1090 m asl. The agricultural terraces are located on the third natural terrace and in the piedmont area. In the area between the agricultural terraces, the landscape is also dotted with residential units
(Assandri, 2007; Figueroa, 2010). The sites recorded are concentrated
in the southern part of the valley, but this probably reﬂects the fact that
this area has been more intensively surveyed than the northern part.
The residential sites are usually rectangular but have diﬀerent sizes and
compositions.
The Formative Period is represented in the valley by two mound
sites, El Altillo and Martínez 3, although most sites in the valley have
been radiocarbon dated and are chronologically situated between the
sixth and eleventh centuries AD (Marconetto et al., 2014). This period
corresponds to the development of the Aguada culture in the Ambato
Valley and is known as the Regional Integration period according to
Pérez Gollán (1994). The radiocarbon dates associated with the ﬁre
regimes are also discussed in Marconetto et al. (2014). The end of the

of the ongoing year (0), the previous year (− 1) and the three years
earlier (−3); and also pixels with r2 < 0.6 and r2 ≥ 0.6 (Fig. 5).
Correlations NDVIa - precipitation showed that the southern and
eastern piedmonts of the valley were correlated to precipitations of the
year (no lag) while the central and western zones and the eastern
summits were correlated with precipitations of the previous year (year
− 1). Few isolated pixels were correlated to three years before precipitations (− 3) and none to two years before precipitations (− 2).
These correlations gave an r2 > 0.6, mainly in pixels of the western
slope and north of the valley, which showed a one year lag (year −1);
r2 smaller than 0.6 were seen in pixels of the eastern slopes and south of
the valley, most of them having no lag (Fig. 5).

northwestern and a small northeastern sector (Fig. 3). The highest values were evidenced in the south-west and east of the valley.
4.2. Temporal variation of the annual NDVI (2000–2011) – anomalies
The NDVIa condition in relation to the NDVIp for the period under
study is displayed in Fig. 4. Pixels with standard deviations > 1
(medium anomaly) and 2 (extreme anomaly) were observed in all the
studied period, except for the year 2006 that showed no anomalies.
In the year 2001, the anomalies were greater than the average in the
entire valley. Extreme anomalies were evidenced mainly in the northcentre of the valley, and medium anomalies in the south. In contrast, in
the year 2009 medium and extreme negative anomalies were observed
in the slopes of the hills, while in the centre of the valley no anomalies
were registered. In the year, 2010 medium negative anomalies were
observed in the centre of the valley and extreme negative anomalies in
the south in agreement with the area covered by the December 2009
ﬁre. In the year, 2011 medium positive anomalies were observed in the
north and east of the valley, while in the south, medium negative
anomalies persisted as in 2009.

5. Discussion
This model serves as a tool to ﬁne tune paleoenvironmental reconstructions related to past ﬁre regimens and can be of use in the ﬁeld
of environmental archaeology and paleoecology. As for our study area,
the Ambato Valley, which has multiple archaeological sites aﬀected by
ﬁre, the model can help in adjusting the past ﬁre regimens associated to
for example abandonment and droughts. In areas with related archaeological scenarios associated with ﬁre events, it will be possible to
analyse similar environments and/or archaeological contexts. However,
we will not centre the discussion on the archaeological sites with evidence of ﬁre here, this has been done in other cases (Lindskoug, 2016a;
Lindskoug, 2016b). In the case of microcharcoal studies, this model can
reinforce the reconstructions. As our earlier studies has shown the area
was regularly aﬀected by ﬁres (Lindskoug, 2016a; Lindskoug and
Marconetto, 2014) and also by drought (Marconetto, 2010; Marconetto,
2009), together with the vegetation reconstructions done by the HEMO
modelling (Marconetto et al., 2015) we have been able to ﬁne tune the
past environmental context of the Aguada society. Using these tools, we

4.3. Relation NDVIa – ﬁre
The NDVIa condition during 2009 (ﬁre occurrence year), 2010 and
2011 in relation to the mean NDVIp are shown in Fig. 4. Extensive areas
with extreme and medium negative anomalies were noticeable in 2009.
The following years negative anomalies persisted in the south of the
valley, both extreme (year 2010) and medium (year 2011).

origin (Scott, 2000). However, lightning is the most common factor as
an ignition source. In all cases moisture conditions are important
(Carcaillet, 1998), since ﬁres are more frequent when there is a large
amount of fuel available and lower humidity.
The analysis of the spatial variation of the NDVI average (period
2000–2011) (NDVIp) in the Ambato Valley, permitted the distinction of
diﬀerent sectors of photosynthetic activity of vegetation, according to
the vegetation physiognomy and the presence - absence of agricultural
exploitation.
We could establish an association between diﬀerent NDVI values
and the observed physiognomic units: the highest values agree with
forests; the intermediate values with piedmont forests and grasslands;
and the lowest ones with the shrubland, grassland-shrubland mosaic
and zones with both perennial and annual cultures. Paruelo et al.
(1998) arrived to similar conclusions while doing on a regional scale,
an NDVI spatial zonation in Patagonia, ﬁnding high, medium and low
values for the sub Antarctic forest, grass - steppe and shrub semi-desert
steppe, respectively. Also, Zerda and Tiedemann (2010), through NDVI
values taken in the dry Chaco (Santiago del Estero, Argentina) have
shown to have more photosynthetic activity the forest than the grassland.
The low NDVI values from the cultivation area sectors would be
indicative of plant cover seasonal variations. Since this work was developed at an annual time scale, seasonal diﬀerences in the phenology
of crops tend to smooth out. Thus, high NDVI values in the growing
season get blurred by lack or very scanty plant cover, with low NDVI in
senescent or annual crops harvest periods (Goward et al., 1985), or at
the dormancy time of perennial plants.
With respect to the temporal variation (2000–2011) of the NDVI in
the Ambato Valley, the anomalies show the intensity of the annual
variations. Negative standard deviations of the NDVI mean values are
indicators of dryness; thus, anomalies represent the intensity of
droughts (Britos and Basconcelo, 2012). The quantiﬁcation of the
standard deviations from the annual NDVI mean values (period
2000–2011) (NDVIp) of the Ambato Valley permitted us the detection
of the annual NDVI temporal variation and its magnitude. The year
2001 was a non-dry year, with medium and extreme positive anomalies, in the whole valley. Conversely, except for the centre of the valley,
2009 was a dry year. The rest of the years showed slight variations in
the degree of dryness of the various areas, with isolated cases of both
positive and negative anomalies in some pixels.
Fire in the central part of the Ambato Valley occurred in December
2009 when many trees were burnt. This fact was witnessed by the inhabitants of the region and could be determined in the ﬁre coverage
area through the observed medium negative anomalies in the centre of
the valley and the extreme negative anomalies in the south. According
to Lindskoug (2016a) this event left vegetation consequences for many
years. However, according to our microcharcoal studies in the area ﬁre
has been part of the ecosystem since at least 4500 BP (Lindskoug,
2016a; Lindskoug and Marconetto, 2014). Fires in the area have been
recurrent with diﬀerent intensity and extension not only aﬀecting the
present population but also the past societies living in the area and
especially their cultivated areas (Lindskoug, 2016a; Lindskoug, 2016b).
When summarizing the NDVI behaviour throughout the decade of
study, we could detect medium and extreme positive anomalies in
2001, when abundant plant mass must have been produced. Then, nonanomaly years followed all along the valley. Medium and extreme negative anomalies extensively registered at both slopes in 2009, and later
came the ﬁre.
Thus, in that year, because of the drought, a low hydric state must
have been existed, increasing the ignition probability and somewhat
conditioning the propagation of ﬁre (Burgan et al., 1998). In this sense,
the relation dryness - ﬁre has been reported by Bond and van Wilgen
(1996), among others. Also, it should be considered that the abundance
of plant material in the forests accumulated since 2000 was the ﬁre fuel
(Grau and Veblen, 2000). In this way, the relationship between ﬁre

can enhance the understanding of the past environmental conditions in
the area. These models can also improve the proxies to reconstruct the
past environment related to periods and ﬂuctuations in humidity and
vegetation pattern. These associations are fundamental in the reconstructions; and we argue that the model can detect and reinforce
these ﬂuctuations in ﬁre regimens related to the vegetation history, ﬁre
and variations in humidity.
In terms of wildﬁres, the link between drought and natural ﬁres has
been considered extensively by various scholars (see for example Long
and Whitlock, 2002; Whitlock et al., 2003; Meyer and Pierce, 2003). As
there have been indicators of aridity detected in the study area, the
conditions of the occurrences of wildﬁres were established through the
analysis of the anatomy of charred logs of Geoﬀroea decorticans recovered in contexts associated with ﬁnal occupation of the valley
(Marconetto, 2010; Marconetto, 2009). These ﬁres may have had either
natural or anthropogenic origins. The ignition sources of natural wildﬁres are principally associated with volcanic activity (not applicable to
the study area), lighting strikes, sparks from rock falls, and spontaneous
combustion, but also to accidental combustion that is anthropogenic in

grassland was associated to precipitation of the year in its southern area
and to the previous year in the north. On the eastern side of Sierras de
Graciana Balcozna the Subtropical Montane Cloud Forest is located,
with annual precipitation ranging between 1000 and 2400 mm
(Cabrera, 1976). This Montane Cloud Forest apart from receiving water
through vertical precipitation, has an important horizontal precipitation contribution; in fact, the fog represents 10–40% of the water
contribution to the ecosystem (Hunzinger, 1995). This horizontal precipitation is the one that crosses through the Sierras Graciana Balcozna
summits and covers the highland grassland area of the western side of
the hills. Therefore, because of the fog the highland grasslands from the
Ambato Valley do not depend on vertical precipitations correlations
render/show/evidence low values.
The best correlations with the previous year were evidenced in the
grassland-shrubland mosaic of the western side of the valley. The ﬂuvial
plain forests, now very much impacted by walnut tree, soy and corn
cultures were as well better correlated with the previous year rainfalls.
The dry Chaco has, according to the NDVI dynamics and in the
presence of rainfall and temperature variations, a forest with greater
stability than the natural grassland due to a greater diversity of species
in the forest, and mainly to rooted woody plants, which explore the
deepest soil layers and do not depend on precipitations (Zerda and
Tiedemann, 2010). On the contrary, the Chaco grassland immediately
reacts after precipitation, which is highly expected because of the great
eﬃciency of the root system in using water. Therefore the grasses with
a more superﬁcial root systems than trees and shrubs, show growth
pulses connected to precipitation (Villagra et al., 2011).
The forest and some sectors west of the Ambato Valley have a high
correlation with precipitations of the year of the rainfall or the previous
year, sometimes with a low NDVI-precipitation correlation, thus demonstrating that the forest dynamic is slightly altered by rainfall variations. Particularly, in the Prosopis nigra and Geoﬀroea decorticans
forests, woody plants have access to deep water reservoirs through the
development of extensive root systems (Villagra et al., 2011; Dalmasso,
2010), and thus these species do not strictly depend on precipitations.
Therefore, the low forest and grassland - precipitation correlations
observed in our analysis would indicate more stability in these units
than in those with shrub predominance. Our analysis showed that due
to the independence between the forest and grassland vigour-rainfall,
the low forest and grassland-precipitation correlations would indicate

sources and NDVI negative anomalies could be veriﬁed in this study.
Therefore, we can show that the ﬁre was related to climatic factors
controlling the fuel production. This ﬁre-anomaly relation was also
demonstrated in the Spanish forest (Vázquez et al., 2001). Sectors south
of the valley that had been aﬀected by ﬁre, the following year showed
the smallest NDVI values, evidencing a low plant cover.
In 2011, all pixels had increased NDVI values. Those pixels that had
shown extreme negative anomalies (burnt areas), in the last year of
study showed medium negative anomalies, indicative of ﬁre scars,
while pixels with negative means in 2010, in 2011 showed no
anomalies and pixels without anomalies in 2010 presented medium
positive anomalies in 2011. That is, the increasing NDVI evidenced a
recovery of all the vegetation units, possibly before better climatic
conditions.
We found relations between NDVI and precipitation. In the
Argentine Puna, Baldassini (2010), found that the annual precipitation
was the main climatic factor associated to the spatial variability of
primary productivity. In our present work, we detected areas with
NDVI's best correlated with the year of precipitation and others with the
previous year. The time-lag shows to be an important phenomenon
since it reveals how quickly the ecosystem responds to the climate
change impacts (Gao et al., 2016). The forest and grassland NDVI's
related either with the year of precipitation or to the previous one,
while shrublands correlated only with the previous year precipitation.
Sectors of the valley with NDVI-precipitation correlations of more than
two or more previous years were not found.
The forests which showed a relation with rainfalls of the year (no
lags), were mainly in the southern and eastern piedmont (Fig. 5). Similarly, in the Sahel and East Africa, Nicholson et al. (1990) found that
plant formation in arid environments respond clear and immediately to
precipitation. The same responses were obtained by Wang et al. (2003)
in the Central Great Plains (USA), especially after dry periods. However, many of the correlations NDVI-precipitation from the Ambato
Valley were low (< 0.6), especially those southwest of the valley. This
situation shows the low relationship existing between the NDVI of the
forests south of the valley and the year of the precipitation.
In relation to grasslands, we have observed that the largest NDVI precipitation correlations belong to the same or previous year. Only
some pixels had high correlations. On the western side of Sierra
Graciana Balcozna, in the summit of the hill at 1250–1920 m asl. The

previous month rainfalls. Because of this, the relationship between
NDVI and precipitation of the diﬀerent zones of the Ambato Valley
should be explored at shorter time scales.
The absence of a closer relationship between precipitation and annual NDVI could also be related to the diﬀerence of rainfall according to
the topography as well as to the lack of quantitative information on the
contribution of moisture. In this study, the low spatial resolution of the
precipitation data did not allow a more detailed assessment of the

more stability in these units than in those with shrub predominance.
Fabricante et al. (2009) found a low correlation between the interannual variation of the NDVI and the annual precipitation, current and
previous, in arid ecosystems of North Patagonia. In contrast, it was
highly correlated to the accumulated precipitation in the few months
before the growing season. Furthermore, Iglesias et al. (2010) found in
dry forests of western Argentina a correlation between precipitation
and NDVI, which, in general, showed to be greater when related to the

evidenced the fact that some zones of the Ambato Valley are more
sensitive to rainfalls of the ongoing year while others are to the previous year. On the other hand, we must emphasize the importance of
fog coming from the Yungas, showing that in some areas of the valley
the horizontal precipitation can make important contributions to the
ecosystem humidity.
On the other hand, these models can serve to adjust the comprehension of the result of the paleaoenvironmental retrodiction. Thus this
type of analysis is a good complement to the study of past ﬁre regimens
based on microcharcoal studies. This model can help us adjust the
variations in the past ﬁre regimens especially with the impossibility of
radiocarbon dating all soil samples extracted in the ﬁeld when studying
the past wildland ﬁre events.
Finding these associations linked with the paleoenvironmental retrodictions that stretches to archaeological epochs will permit to consider potential ﬁre scenarios in the past that can be of interest to resolve
diﬀerent problems in the ﬁeld of archaeology, especially related to
environmental factors, which could have aﬀected past societies.

relationship NDVI-precipitation. On the other hand, there is a need to
inquire into this relationship on diﬀerent time scales.
This work on the modern NDVI dynamic and its relation to precipitation and ﬁre will permit improving the interpretation of annual
paleo-NDVI ﬂuctuations detected along the last 1600 years in the
Ambato Valley by means of the Hindcasting Ecosystem Model
(Marconetto et al., 2015). Associations can be made with diﬀerent local
or global environmental conditions (D'Antoni et al., 2016).
This study represents a contribution to future archaeological studies
for the retrodiction of the environment and ﬁre events.
6. Conclusions
The implications of this study can be considered from two points of
view: ﬁrstly, the usefulness of this kind of models to describe local
ecological variables in the study area and secondly, its application to
paleoenvironmental reconstructions and its use in environmental archaeology and paleoecology associated to past ﬁre events.
In relation to the local ecological variables we can conclude that a
spatial variation of the annual NDVI linked to the type of vegetation of
the Ambato Valley is evidenced. Both the south western and piedmont
forests, and the summit grasslands of Sierra Balcozna show the highest
NDVI values; the shrub-grassland mosaic has medium values. However,
the shrub-grassland mosaic characterised by cultured annual species,
like soy and corn, and deciduous trees (walnut trees) shows the lowest
NDVI values. This diﬀerence can be explained by the wide NDVI seasonal variations of cultures that smooth the annual NDVI of the agricultural sector.
Regarding the NDVI temporal variation, anomalies were detected
during all the studied period. In 2009, extreme negative anomalies were
registered, representing a particularly dry year with probable accumulation of ﬂammable material. Coincidently, at the end of 2009 a ﬁre
of great magnitude occurred.
As for the vegetation types, the NDVI-precipitation relation
