Archaeological and paleoecological studies demonstrate that human-caused ﬁres have long-term inﬂuences on
terrestrial and atmospheric systems, including the transformation of “wild” landscapes into managed, agricultural landscapes. Sedimentary charcoal accumulations alone provide only limited information about the inﬂuence of human-caused ﬁres on long-term ﬁre regimes. Computational modeling oﬀers a new approach to
anthropogenic ﬁre that links social and biophysical processes in a “virtual laboratory” where long-term scenarios
can be simulated and compared with empirical charcoal data. This paper presents CharRec, a computational
model of landscape ﬁre, charcoal dispersion, and deposition that simulates charcoal records formed by multiple
natural and anthropogenic ﬁre regimes. CharRec is applied to a case study in the Canal de Navarrés region in
eastern Spain to reveal the role of human-driven ﬁre regimes during the early and middle Holocene. A statistical
comparison of simulated charcoal records and empirical charcoal data from the Canal de Navarrés indicates that
anthropogenic burning, following the Neolithic transition to agro-pastoral subsistence, was a primary driver of
ﬁre activity during the middle Holocene.

1. Introduction
Humans are uniquely able to use ﬁre as a tool to deliberately create
and sustain changes in their environments (Boivin et al., 2016; Bowman
et al., 2011; Ellis, 2015; Roos et al., 2014; Scott et al., 2016). Regular
and controlled use of ﬁre by hominins dates to the Middle Pleistocene,
but measurable impacts of anthropogenic ﬁre on terrestrial and atmospheric systems are most evident during the last several millennia
(Bowman et al., 2011; Roebroeks and Villa, 2011; Shimelmitz et al.,
2014). Multiple global syntheses of archaeological and ethnographic
case studies identify ﬁre's role in political, religious, and ecological
realms, including burning practices associated with land clearing,
warfare, driving game, propagating beneﬁcial plant and animal species,
and ﬁre prevention (Bliege Bird et al., 2008; Bowman et al., 2011; Pyne,
2012; Scherjon et al., 2015; Trauernicht et al., 2015). Diversity in anthropogenic ﬁre can create variation in local and regional ﬁre regimes;
however, evidence of human-driven ignitions is not readily observable
in sedimentary charcoal records, particularly when these ﬁres co-occur
with large-scale changes in climate and fuels.
This paper presents the Charcoal Record Simulation Model
(CharRec), a computational model that simulates the formation of sedimentary charcoal records based on varying ﬁre regime components,
including ﬁre frequency, intensity, size, and spatial distribution. These
components can be modiﬁed to represent ﬁre regimes shaped by

varying human and climate drivers. Following a pattern-oriented
modeling approach, CharRec is built using a bottom-up strategy where
observable patterns within target datasets inform programming decisions (Grimm et al., 2005). This strategy allows CharRec to function as a
“virtual laboratory,” where multiple model outputs are compared to
patterns within empirical charcoal data to identify which combinations
of ﬁre regime components mostly likely contributed to the formation of
the empirical record through time (Bankes et al., 2002).
1.1. Formation and interpretation of sedimentary charcoal records
Variation in the concentration of charcoal particles from lacustrine
cores or terrestrial sediment samples is commonly used to identify paleoenvironmental trends in landscape ﬁre (Bowman et al., 2011, 2009;
Whitlock and Anderson, 2003; Whitlock and Larsen, 2001). Bridging
the interpretive gap between charcoal abundance and ﬁre history has
remained at the forefront of paleoecological research for several decades. The theoretical relationships between charcoal transport and accumulation were ﬁrst proposed by Clark (1988a,b) and have since been
expanded to consider the inﬂuence of combustion and atmospheric
conditions on primary charcoal dispersal, such as ﬁre intensity, ﬁre
size, and charcoal morphology (Adolf et al., 2018; Clark et al., 1998;
Clark and Royall, 1996, 1995; Higuera et al., 2011; Leys et al., 2015,
2017; Li et al., 2017; Lynch et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2017; Peters and

archaeological data on human activities and paleoecological data on
ﬁre and vegetation change (Bowman et al., 2011). Prominent archaeological approaches to ﬁre have centered on detecting evidence of
landscape burning in relation to food production and hunter-gatherer
impacts on ancient environments. Low-level food production (Smith,
2001), “ﬁre-stick” farming (Bird et al., 2005; Bliege Bird et al., 2013,
2008), swidden agriculture (Levin and Ayres, 2017; Roos, 2008; Roos
et al., 2016; Schier et al., 2013), and mitigating resource vulnerability
(Freeman and Anderies, 2012) suggest that ﬁre was an important tool
for creating predictable resource mosaics within landscapes across the
globe (North America: Liebmann et al., 2016; Roos, 2015; Roos et al.,
2010; Sullivan et al., 2015; Sullivan and Forste, 2014; Swetnam et al.,
2016; Taylor et al., 2016; Van de Water and Saﬀord, 2011; Walsh et al.,
2010; Europe: Doyen et al., 2013; Innes et al., 2013; Southeast Asia/
Oceania: Maxwell, 2004; McGlone, 2001; McWethy et al., 2010, 2009;
Roos et al., 2016; Neotropics: Dull, 2004; Nevle et al., 2011).
Anthropogenic ﬁre may also be a primary driver of ﬁre regimes in
regions with long-term histories of agricultural land-use (Carrión et al.,
2010, 2001; Colombaroli et al., 2008; Vannière et al., 2008). For instance, Pitkänen et al. examined two lacustrine sediment cores from
Lake Pönttölampi in eastern Finland to evaluate the formation of the
local charcoal record and its association with documented “slash and
burn” agricultural practices (Pitkänen et al., 1999; Pitkänen and
Huttunen, 1999). By examining charcoal data in conjunction with historical maps of land-use and ﬁre-scarred trees, Pitkänen and colleagues
(1999) concluded that frequent, low-intensity ﬁres associated with
maintaining open woodlands contributed signiﬁcantly to the sedimentary charcoal record and were the primary driver of local ﬁre history.
Unfortunately, the patterns reported by this study would be diﬃcult to
observe in prehistoric contexts that predate historic documents and
living, ﬁre-scarred trees. Simulation models provide an opportunity to
examine multiple patterns of burning in prehistory while accommodating complex patterns of both natural and anthropogenic ignition
sources. Evaluating simulations against empirical charcoal data allows
multiple, alternative interpretations of prehistoric ﬁre regimes to be
tested, adapted, and improved.

Higuera, 2007; Vachula and Richter, 2018). Fire history interpretations
from these models rely on two major underlying assumptions: 1) the
physics of primary charcoal transport result in spatially discernible
diﬀerences in the distribution of charcoal particles following a ﬁre; and
2) secondary charcoal transport is minimal and does not obfuscate
patterns of primary deposition and ﬁre occurrence (Higuera et al.,
2007).
The distribution and abundance of primary, aerially dispersed
charcoal is assumed to be a function of charcoal attributes related to
fuel combustion and atmospheric conditions during a ﬁre (Aleman
et al., 2013; Clark, 1988a; Clark et al., 1998; Duﬃn et al., 2008; Enache
and Cumming, 2007, 2006; Lynch et al., 2004; Peters and Higuera,
2007; Vachula and Richter, 2018). Generally, the relationship between
these variables results in spatially diﬀerentiated dispersion, where
macroscopic charcoal particles (typically > 100 μm) are dispersed close
to their source and are interpreted as local in origin; microscopic
charcoal particles (typically < 100 μm) can be dispersed greater distances and are typically interpreted as representing regional ﬁres
(Clark, 1988b; Clark et al., 1998; Ohlson and Tryterud, 2000). This
relationship assumes that atmospheric and combustion conditions remain constant throughout the duration of a ﬁre; while this assumption
may not always hold true, transport distances based on charcoal size
have been empirically validated in multiple studies (Clark and Royall,
1996; Gardner and Whitlock, 2001; Lynch et al., 2004; Ohlson and
Tryterud, 2000; Pisaric, 2002; Tinner et al., 2006; Whitlock and
Millspaugh, 1996). More recent work has examined the impact of
varying conditions on charcoal production and the mechanisms of
primary charcoal transport, concluding that particle morphology,
shape, and density are also important in interpreting ﬁre origin (Duﬃn
et al., 2008; Leys et al., 2015, 2017; Vachula and Richter, 2018).
Secondary charcoal refers to charcoal introduced into the sedimentary record during non-ﬁre years by geomorphological processes
such as run-oﬀ, post-depositional sediment mixing, or other landscape
reservoir eﬀects. Empirical studies of post-ﬁre slope-wash estimate that
the contribution of additional charcoal from non-ﬁre years can continue
for upwards of a decade, but in quantities small enough not to mask
primary deposition (Carcaillet et al., 2006; Clark, 1988a; Clark et al.,
1998; Lynch et al., 2004; Patterson et al., 1987; Whitlock and
Millspaugh, 1996). Mixing within the sediment column can further
blur, but not entirely obscure primary charcoal deposition. Statistical
methods for peak detection and sampling strategies that capture the full
extent of ﬁre return intervals help to account for these processes (Clark,
1988b; Finsinger et al., 2014; Higuera et al., 2010; Kelly et al., 2011).
Peak detection methods rely on separating a charcoal series into its
background and peak components. Background charcoal refers to lowfrequency variations in macro-charcoal accumulation, as well as contributions from secondary charcoal transport (Higuera et al., 2010;
Kelly et al., 2011). When background charcoal is statistically removed,
peak charcoal related to primary transport and deposition is distinguishable (Finsinger et al., 2014). The distinction between background
and peak charcoal components may be unclear in landscapes with both
natural and anthropogenic ignition sources (Bowman et al., 2011).
Ethnographic examples of managed ﬁre indicate that ignitions are often
spatially circumscribed, frequent, and at low intensities (Scherjon et al.,
2015), hence it is possible that local anthropogenic burning may contribute to low-frequency accumulations of macro-charcoal without
clear and discernible peaks. Thus, the anthropogenic signal may be
misidentiﬁed or obscured, particularly if a sampling strategy is not
designed to accommodate for short ﬁre return intervals.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Introduction to CharRec and model design considerations
CharRec is a spatially explicit computational model developed to
simulate the formation of long-term charcoal records based on empirically supported models of primary charcoal transport (Fig. 1). The
model is an exploratory tool that assists researchers in interpreting how
natural and anthropogenic ﬁre regime components contribute to the
formation of a sedimentary charcoal record. One of the most challenging aspects of developing computer simulations of social-ecological
systems is including adequate complexity to address speciﬁc research
questions while reducing the amount of uncertainty in the model
structure and parameters. Pattern-oriented modeling oﬀers a strategy
for optimizing the relationship between complexity and uncertainty by
focusing on multiple patterns observed in real systems at diﬀering
scales (Grimm et al., 2005). Such models focus on a small number of
underlying processes that can be calibrated independently to inﬂuence
the overall pattern of the system (Grimm et al., 2005:989). CharRec
does not attempt to capture the extensive complexity of charcoal production, dispersion, and deposition. Instead, it utilizes four speciﬁc
components that contribute to the overall patterning of primary charcoal in sedimentary records. These include ﬁre spatial distribution,
frequency, size, and intensity. These characteristics are highly susceptible to manipulation by humans, thus providing a means for testing the
inﬂuence of burning practices related to land-use on the formation of
charcoal records.
The following section describes the speciﬁc modules that compose
CharRec and presents a statistical method for comparing simulated

1.2. Anthropogenic ﬁre in the archaeological record
Humans have intentionally set ﬁres for millennia to transform the
arrangement or diversity of resources within their landscape (Boivin
et al., 2016; Pyne, 2012). Identifying prehistoric human inﬂuences on
ﬁre regimes remains diﬃcult due to a mismatch between available

Anderson (1982) for predicting wildﬁre behavior. According to these
models, fuels are grouped by load, meaning the amount and arrangement of vegetation within a stand, as well as size and moisture classes,
such as ﬁne (1-h) and larger-diameter fuels (10-h) (Anderson, 1982).
Although updated models have improved accuracy in North American
ecosystems (see Scott and Burgan, 2005), the original 13 models have
been adapted to describe a diverse range of international ecosystems.
For broad usability, CharRec uses these original models. Available dead
and live biomass approximations for 1-h and 10-h fuel size classes are
assigned to each landscape patch. For each simulation, a single fuel
model is distributed uniformly across all patches. Potential heat release
rates from combustion are calculated for all fuel model size classes
(Johansen et al., 1976: Equation (1)) and used to approximate plume
injection heights resulting from convective uplift (Clark, 1988a: Equation (5)). These calculations are done assuming a wind velocity of
0 m s−1, thus producing the maximum potential plume injection height
for each fuel class. These data are saved in CharRec as global variables
for later use in the Burn, Disperse, and Deposit module.

charcoal data against empirical datasets. CharRec is built in Netlogo
Version 6.0.2, an agent-based programming language and open-access
modeling environment (Wilensky, 1999). Netlogo is ideal for this
modeling application because it is easily programmed and customized,
has a user-friendly interface, and easily couples with other open-access
GIS and statistical software. The model and the Overview, Design concepts, and Details (ODD) documentation are publicly available through
the CoMSES Net Computational Model Library (Snitker, 2018).
2.2. CharRec modules and main components
CharRec is composed of ﬁve modules: 1) Landscape, 2) Ignition
Scenario, 3) Burn, Disperse, and Deposit, 4) Form record, and 5) Export
modules; together these simulate the formation of a sedimentary
charcoal record on an annual time scale. In a simulation run, ﬁres
disperse micro- and macro-charcoal throughout the landscape, which is
aggregated at a designated sampling point by a set deposition interval
(e.g., 100 yr cm−1). At the end of each deposition interval, charcoal
counts are exported as a single observation in the charcoal record
series. A diagrammatic representation of the relationship between
CharRec modules is illustrated in Fig. 2.

2.2.2. Ignition scenario module
The Ignition Scenario module determines the ﬁre regime components (ﬁre spatial distribution, frequency, size, and intensity) used in
each model run. These variables are set by the user to simulate natural
or anthropogenic ignitions, thus inﬂuencing charcoal production, dispersion, and deposition in subsequent modules. First, ﬁre frequency is
determined annually by a Poisson probability distribution based on a
user-deﬁned mean-ignitions-per-year value (see Higuera et al., 2007 for
a similar method). A low mean-ignitions-per-year value may result in
many model years that do not have any ﬁres burning on the landscape,
while a higher value will allow for multiple ﬁres to burn simultaneously.
Fire spatial distribution is determined by the ignition probability
raster applied to each landscape patch. A random-number algorithm is
used to determine a ﬁre's potential location; this algorithm is weighted
to favor areas with high ignition probabilities over those with low
probabilities. The range of probability values available to the random-

2.2.1. Landscape module
The CharRec model landscape is a geo-referenced representation of
a user-deﬁned study area and is composed of rasters representing topographic, atmospheric, and fuel conditions. The physical terrain of the
model landscape is derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) raster
applied to each landscape patch (NASA, 2011). Atmospheric input
rasters are created from modern local weather station measurements of
wind velocity and direction (IVIA, 2015). These data are interpolated
across the model landscape using WindNinja, a free software program
developed by the U.S Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station's
Fire, Fuel, Smoke Science Program (Forthofer et al., 2014). WindNinja
creates patch-speciﬁc, spatially varying wind ﬁelds based on topographic variation.
Fuels in CharRec are based on the 13 fuel models developed by

released from the combustion of fuels at each landscape patch (Keeley,
2009). Fuel size classes and plume injection heights calculated in the
Landscape module are used to diﬀerentiate between ﬁre intensities. For
example, when an ignition scenario includes low-intensity ﬁres, only
plume injection heights calculated from the heat release rate of 1-h
fuels are used. Ignition scenarios with high-intensity ﬁres use plume
injection heights calculated from the heat release rate of both 1-h and
10-h fuels. Although there is variation within fuel models, generally a
ﬁre consuming 1-h fuels results in a shorter plume injection height than
a ﬁre consuming both 1-h and 10-h fuels.

number algorithm is set by a user-deﬁned probability cutoﬀ. In practice, if the probability cutoﬀ is set at 0, all landscape patches within the
model landscape have the potential to ignite. If the probability cutoﬀ is
set at 0.5, a subset of landscape patches with ignition probabilities
above or equal to 0.5 have the potential to ignite. The probability cutoﬀ
parameter allows for a range of spatial conﬁgurations to be tested.
Changes in ﬁre size are modeled through a size function that randomly selects the number of additional patches that a ﬁre will occupy.
The number of additional patches ranges from 0 to 8; a value of 0 indicates that a ﬁre will remain in its original patch (0.09 ha), while a
value of 8 indicates the ﬁre will occupy all adjacent patches via a shared
edge or a shared vertex (0.81 ha). The intensity of the original ﬁre is
assigned to all additional ﬁres.
Within CharRec, ﬁre intensity refers to the amount of energy

2.2.3. Burn, disperse, and deposit module
Once a ﬁre ignites on a landscape patch, its intensity determines the
size class of available biomass that is consumed and the injection height

of deposition. Once the number of model years in the deposit interval is
reached, the Form Record module aggregates charcoal counts at the
sample location into a single observation of micro- and macro-charcoal.
A complete CharRec simulation is run for a user-deﬁned number of
deposit interval observations. At the end of the simulation, the Export
module collates all charcoal count observations created by the Form
Record module, as well as ignition scenario variables used during the
simulation, and exports them as a comma-separated values ﬁle. A map
of all ﬁre locations created during the simulation is also exported in
raster format.

of the resulting plume. Available biomass is converted into charcoal
mass using the conversion rate published by (Gavin (2001):32). Charcoal mass is then transformed into micro- and macro-charcoal particle
counts based on experimental charcoal particle size distribution data
published by Pitkänen et al. (1999). Plume injection height for each ﬁre
is modiﬁed by wind velocity at the ﬁre's patch following the empirical
relationship illustrated by (Clark (1988a): Equation (5)). Finally, the
amount of micro- and macro-charcoal dispersed at a given x and y
distance from a ﬁre's patch is calculated using a three-dimensional form
of Clark's (1988a) Gaussian aerial transport model adapted by (Peters
and Higuera (2007): Equations (1) and (2)). The equations and parameters (Table 2) are reproduced below (see Higuera et al., 2007 and

2.2.5. Statistical comparison of model outputs to an empirical charcoal
record using LDA
Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a statistical method for classiﬁcation that reduces a dataset into a lower dimensional space while
maximizing the separation between multiple classes (Duda et al., 2001).
LDA is a ﬂexible and robust classiﬁcation technique that does not require data standardization (i.e. z-score transformation) or normal distributions, making it an ideal candidate for comparing CharRec outputs
to empirical sedimentary charcoal data. LDA uses an initial dataset to
form linear combinations of predictor variables that emphasize diﬀerences between classiﬁcation groups. The resulting linear discriminants
can then be used to classify new data, generating posterior probabilities
of classiﬁcation group membership for each observation in the new
dataset. The best-ﬁt classiﬁcation for each new observation is determined by the highest posterior probability. The distribution of posterior probabilities for other classiﬁcation groups provides insight into
the quality of the best-ﬁt classiﬁcation.
When comparing CharRec simulated charcoal data to an empirical
charcoal record, the unique ignition scenario parameters from each
complete simulation constitutes a classiﬁcation group. Linear discriminants for charcoal data created by CharRec are used to predict
ignition scenario membership for each micro- and macro-charcoal

Wind direction at the ﬁre's origin is used to determine the direction of
micro- and macro-charcoal fallout. Counts of micro- and macro-charcoal are recorded only when fallout reaches the user-designated sampling site. The Burn, Disperse, and Deposit module operates simultaneously for every ﬁre that burns on the landscape during a model year.

highest posterior probability is considered a ‘best-ﬁt’ for a given observation in the empirical dataset. Prediction quality for the best-ﬁt
ignition scenario is assessed by comparing its posterior probability to
the mean probability of all classiﬁcation groups in the original dataset;
the greater a best-ﬁt ignition scenario's deviation from the mean posterior probability, the higher its prediction quality.

this process may have occurred, as well as the relative importance of
anthropogenic and natural ignitions, from charcoal and pollen data
alone.
To evaluate the extent to which Neolithic anthropogenic burning or
natural ignitions shaped the ﬁre regimes in the Canal de Navarrés, a
series of simulated charcoal records were produced using CharRec and
compared to N3, the most detailed charcoal record collected and analyzed by Carríon and Van Geel (1999). Multiple ignition scenarios were
designed with combinations of ﬁre spatial distribution, frequency, size,
and intensity to emulate lightning-ignited ﬁres and two models of
Neolithic burning. Modeled Neolithic ﬁres included frequent low-intensity broadcast burning associated with pastoral land-use, and frequent high-intensity, spatially conﬁned ﬁres related to land clearing
and swidden agriculture. Ignition probability maps (Fig. 5) for natural
and anthropogenic ignition scenarios were generated using available
data on lightning-caused ﬁre locations (EFFIS, 2014) and archaeological survey data from the Canal de Navarrés (Diez Castillo et al.,
2016; García Puchol et al., 2014; Snitker et al., in press). The N3 sedimentary charcoal record contains dated deposits spanning the last
25,000 years, but only charcoal concentrations from the late Pleistocene through early/middle Holocene (13,000–3800 BP) and two size
classes (micro-charcoal: 25–150 μm; macro-charcoal: > 150 μm) were
simulated to evaluate ﬁre regimes before, during, and after the transition to agro-pastoral economies. Fuel models adapted for the Canal de
Navarrés by the Instituto para la Conservación de la Naturaleza were used
in this simulation (MAPA, 1989). Details about ignition scenarios and
data inputs are shown in Table 3.
3. Results
3.1. Sensitivity analysis
To evaluate the sensitivity of CharRec to changes in the ignition
scenario, a series of sensitivity tests were conducted on a randomly
generated model landscape (see Table 4 for sensitivity parameters). To
identify the minimum number of charcoal observations needed to build
a representative sample for each ignition scenario, a sample of lowintensity, high-intensity, and mixed-intensity scenarios were modeled
to simulate 1000 observations each. The variance within a random
sample of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 observations of each scenario was calculated and compared across ignition scenarios. Results indicated that 300 observations are the fewest
needed to capture most variance within each ignition scenario. This
number of observations was used in sensitivity analyses and all further
model experiments (see Barton et al., 2015 for more details on this
approach).
Model sensitivity was evaluated using a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT)

To demonstrate the utility of CharRec and evaluate potential natural
or anthropogenic drivers of ﬁre regimes in an empirical test case, a
series of simulated records were generated for comparison with a terrestrial sedimentary charcoal record from the Canal de Navarrés,
Valencia, Spain (Fig. 3). The Canal de Navarrés (39° 06′ N, 0° 41′ W) is a
ﬂat-bottomed valley located at the intersection of the Iberian and Baetic
mountain systems. The area is semiendorheic due to tectonic activity,
creating small lakes, peatlands, and travertines throughout the region
(La Roca et al., 1996). The valley and much of surrounding uplands are
currently intensively cultivated, but abandoned areas support matorral
species such as Quercus coccifera, Erica sp., Ulex europaeus, and occasional stands of Pinus halepensis.
Previous research in the Canal de Navarrés has identiﬁed archaeological material dating to the end of the Middle Pleistocene, but for the
purposes of this case study, only archaeological periods during the late
Pleistocene and early/middle Holocene are addressed (see Table 1).
Investigations into the early agricultural history in Canal de Navarrés
began in the 1940s with the excavation of Ereta de Pedregal, an openair site located in the center of the valley. Initial testing and later excavations revealed structures and artifacts dating to the late Neolithic
and Bell Beaker periods (Fletcher Valls, 1964; Menéndez Amor and
Florschütz, 1961; Pla Ballester et al., 1983). In the decades since, the
Canal de Navarrés has been studied extensively as part of a multi-year,
joint research program by Arizona State University and the University
of Valencia to systematically collect archaeological and paleoecological
data in an eﬀort to better understand the evolution of agro-pastoral
landscapes (Diez Castillo et al., 2016; García Puchol et al., 2014; Snitker
et al., in press). Recent archaeological survey results indicate relatively
ephemeral land-use during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene,
including the early (7600–6800 BP) and middle (6800–6000 BP) Neolithic periods. This trend is interrupted by a marked increase in artifact
densities during the late Neolithic (6000–4500 BP) and Bell Beaker
periods (4500–3800 PB), suggesting agricultural land-use intensiﬁcation (Snitker et al., in press).
Three terrestrial sedimentary cores (referred to as N1, N2, and N3)
were collected and analyzed from peat deposits near Ereta del Pedregal
to track long-term changes in vegetation, ﬁre, and climate (Carrión and
Dupré, 1996; Carrión and Van Geel, 1999). These records indicated a
substantial increase in charcoal concentrations and shift from pine-to
oak-dominated vegetation communities at approximately 7000 BP
(Fig. 4A–B). The introduction of agricultural burning by Neolithic
farmers likely caused these changes, but it is diﬃcult to determine how

observations of micro- and macro-charcoal. LDA was applied to all
2400 simulated records, generating linear discriminants for each ignition scenario. Linear discriminants were used to classify the empirical
micro- and macro-charcoal counts from N3 into best-ﬁt ignition scenarios based on the posterior probability of group membership. Best-ﬁt
ignition scenarios were assembled chronologically to create a composite simulated charcoal record that reﬂects changes in ﬁre regime
components through time. A comparison of the empirical charcoal data
from N3 and the composite simulated record generated by CharRec is
illustrated in Fig. 7A–B.
CharRec simulations indicate that the N3 charcoal record is best
described by a range of natural ignition scenarios leading up to the
transition to Neolithic agro-pastoral land-use. During the transition
between the late Mesolithic and early Neolithic periods, charcoal
counts increase, and best-ﬁt scenarios ﬂuctuate between natural and
pastoral ignitions. At approximately 7400 BP, ignitions stabilize with
pastoral ﬁres as the dominant scenario throughout the remainder of the
early and middle Neolithic periods. Both micro- and macro-charcoal
counts in both the N3 charcoal record and the simulated composite
record signiﬁcantly increase during the late Neolithic period and continue at elevated accumulation rates through the Bell Beaker Period.

methodology, where one ignition scenario parameter is changed at a
time, while keeping all others at baseline values. Charcoal counts
generated from all sensitivity tests were z-score transformed and described by a linear regression model. Fig. 6A–C presents linear model
coeﬃcients and their 95% conﬁdence intervals for each test. CharRec
charcoal counts are most sensitive to changes in fuel model and ﬁre
intensity in all parameter combinations that were tested. Fuel models
are readily distinguishable within the tests, but intensity does cause
some overlap between conﬁdence intervals for low-intensity and
mixed-intensity ﬁres (Fig. 6A). Diﬀerences between ﬁre frequency and
spatial distribution (Fig. 6B–C) are very stable and are primarily differentiated by ﬁre intensity. With only a few exceptions, linear model
coeﬃcients and their conﬁdence intervals for these ignition scenario
parameters do not overlap, suggesting that simulated charcoal records
can be discerned based on their inputs.

4. Discussion

The Younger Dryas and other aridity events documented through regional pollen sequences are not easily distinguishable in the simulated
or empirical charcoal accumulations (López de Pablo and Gómez Puche,
2009). However, changes in best-ﬁt ignition scenarios from 9600 to
9400 BP and 8200–7900 BP do correspond with increased aridity and
lower temperatures observed in other records, suggesting ﬁres were still
natural (Burjachs et al., 2016).
At the beginning of the early Neolithic, ﬁres were likely still regional, with some indications that anthropogenic ﬁre was emerging as a
presence on the landscape. Fire intensity, spatial distribution, and fuels
reﬂect a similar pattern suggesting pastoral ﬁre was present, but not a
driving force in shaping the regional ﬁre regime. Archaeological survey
results from the Canal de Navarrés support this conclusion, indicating
that early Neolithic occupations were not speciﬁcally identiﬁable from
surface assemblages. Occupations were likely episodic, with periods of
low-intensity land-use followed by extended hiatuses (Snitker et al., in
press).
At the end of the early Neolithic (7200–6800 BP) and throughout
the middle Neolithic (6800–6000 BP), simulations suggest that ﬁres
became consistently larger and more frequent. Fires are also restricted
to areas with the highest densities of Neolithic artifacts, implying the
establishment of regular, patterned anthropogenic burning related to
Neolithic pastoral practices in the region. Fuel models represented in
the simulated records also transitioned from closed communities in
model 4, to more open woodland in model 6. Patterns of regular, low-

4.1. Drivers of early and middle Holocene ﬁre regimes in the Canal de
Navarrés
The composite simulated charcoal record generated through
CharRec provides a robust tool for interpreting the N3 charcoal record
in terms of the anthropogenic and natural ﬁre regime components that
contributed to its formation. Variations in ﬁre regime parameters
through time provide speciﬁc insights the spatial and temporal dimensions of ﬁre on the landscape and how they relate to human landuse decisions. The following discussion of the model results is interpreted in the context of the archaeological and paleoecological data
from the Canal de Navarrés.
Broadly, the CharRec simulated charcoal record indicates that increased charcoal accumulations in the Canal de Navarrés during the
early and middle Holocene was driven by intensifying Neolithic landuse, not climate. Simulated records during late Pleistocene and early
Holocene (13,000–7600 BP) demonstrated that ﬁres were primarily
natural and caused by regional lightning strikes across a wide geographic area, resulting in the accumulation of background charcoal.
The presence of some variation during this period in the N3 charcoal
record may be accounted for by the ephemeral occupations by
Mesolithic hunter-gatherers (Innes et al., 2013; Innes and Blackford,
2003; Zvelebil, 1994) or ﬂuctuations in climate (Carrión et al., 2010).

4.2. Future CharRec developments and applications

intensity burning were likely intentionally used to create open, matorral vegetation communities, amenable to grazing. Post-ﬁre resprouting genera, such Quercus, are able to outcompete reseeding
genera such as Pinus, resulting in a sudden reduction in pine pollen like
that observed between approximately 7000–6000 BP by Carrión and
Van Geel (1999) (see Pausas, 1999 for a discussion of Mediteranean
plant responses to ﬁre).
Finally, the N3 and simulated charcoal record both show a substantial increase in charcoal accumulations during the late Neolithic
(6000–4500 BP) and Bell Beaker (4500–3800 BP) periods. CharRec
model runs also indicate that ﬁre frequencies were highest during this
period and low-intensity pastoral ﬁres were spatially constrained to
lowland and transitional areas in the valley bottom and margins.
Fig. 9A–B illustrate the extent of the spatial diﬀerentiation between
simulated ﬁres from the late Neolithic and Bell Beaker periods as
compared to the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. The degree of
spatial constriction during later periods, coupled with increased ﬁre
frequency and charcoal accumulation, points to patterns of land-use
intensiﬁcation and permanent settlement. The establishment of the
nearby site of Ereta del Pedregal during the late Neolithic and its
continued use through the Bell Beaker period supports this conclusion
(Pla Ballester et al., 1983). Additionally, data from surface artifact assemblages point to increased diagnostic artifact density during these
periods in areas of transitional elevation on the valley margins, like
those highlighted in Fig. 9B. Although the N3 charcoal record does not
extend beyond 3800 BP, the anthropogenic burning patterns that intensiﬁed during the late Neolithic and Bell Beaker periods likely played
a role in establishing and maintaining an enduring agricultural landscape, whose legacy is apparent in the Canal de Navarrés today.

4.2.1. Improving CharRec simulations of the N3 charcoal record
Fig. 10A–B illustrate a moving window Pearson's r between CharRec
and N3 data, as well as posterior probabilities of best-ﬁt ignition scenarios through time. These two measures are used to evaluate the
quality of the CharRec simulated charcoal record and its ability to describe the N3 empirical charcoal data. CharRec simulated charcoal records correlate well with the empirical data from N3, except for approximately 10,000–7800 BP (Fig. 10A). Classiﬁcation group
probabilities are also low throughout the entirety of the pre-Neolithic
periods, with relatively little distinction between the likelihood of the
best-ﬁt ignition scenario and the probability of all other ignition scenarios (Fig. 10B). Diminished model performance from 13,000 to
7800 BP is likely due to low charcoal counts, making the variation in
the record diﬃcult to accurately replicate. This limitation will need to
be addressed before CharRec can be applied to other sedimentary
charcoal records where the empirical data is less robust.
The current version of CharRec allows for several potential avenues
to improving the model's ability to simulate sedimentary charcoal record formation. These include: 1) increasing the diversity of ignition
scenarios to capture the subtle variation in the low-frequency, microcharcoal accumulations; and 2) adding more sophistication to the atmospheric and combustion conditions that inﬂuence aerial charcoal
dispersion, and 3) incorporating the eﬀects of secondary charcoal
transport and stratigraphic mixing. First, current ignition scenarios in
CharRec provide a limited representation of the diversity of ﬁre intensities and spatial conﬁgurations possible within the Canal de
Navarrés study area. The inclusion of additional archaeological and

h fuels) regional ﬁres or a combination of multiple intensities, possibly
emulating the intermittent occupation of the Canal de Navarrés by
Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.
Second, the current ﬁre ecology literature highlights a need for
considering the complex inﬂuence atmospheric and combustion conditions in primary charcoal production and transport (Adolf et al.,
2018; Leys et al., 2015, 2017; Tinner et al., 2006; Vachula and Richter,
2018). The relationship between micro- and macro-charcoal production

ethnographic analogs would be beneﬁcial in connecting landscape ﬁre
parameters to speciﬁc types of prehistoric land-use, settlement pattern,
and frequency at which a patch is re-burned (Bliege Bird et al., 2013;
Scherjon et al., 2015). Equally, expanding natural ignition scenarios to
reﬂect variation in the number and size of lightning-caused ﬁres, in
response to droughts or aridity, may also help increase model accuracy.
Possible improved ignition scenarios could include a range of new
conﬁgurations, such as larger, more intense (consuming 100-h or 1000-

and dispersion could be improved by drawing from a wider range of
published size-distribution data from experimental ﬁres in other regions. Charcoal particle size-distribution, density, and morphology are
only recently the focus of research to understand their inﬂuence on
transport during and after a ﬁre (Aleman et al., 2013; Duﬃn et al.,
2008; Li et al., 2017; Scott, 2010; Vachula and Richter, 2018). Model
improvements to incorporate variation in charcoal metrics, as they relate to ﬁre intensity and fuel type, could be readily added to the current
model structure. Furthermore, additional complexity in representing
fuels should be incorporated into subsequent versions of CharRec due to
the model's sensitivity to this input. Including multiple fuel types within
the model landscape, a ﬁre spread model that considers fuels structure,
or simple fuel succession models have the potential to substantially
impact model results and interpretations.
Finally, the simple aggregation procedure used in CharRec to create
each centimeter of deposition should be tested to determine if the addition of secondary deposition and stratigraphic mixing modules are
needed. Lacustrine charcoal studies have demonstrated that post-depositional mechanisms must be considered in choosing sampling intervals and making ﬁre history interpretations (Bradbury, 1996; Clark,
1988a; Gardner and Whitlock, 2001; Whitlock and Millspaugh, 1996).
These processes are less intensively studied in terrestrial sedimentary
charcoal series, but the inclusion of functions to describe the potential
contribution of secondary charcoal deposition and sediment mixing
could be added to CharRec to evaluate their inﬂuence on the model's
performance (Higuera et al., 2007). Although the model improvements
described here are not exhaustive, then do provide logical next steps for
model improvements within the pattern-oriented modeling approach.
Despite its current limitations, CharRec is able to generate results that
provide new insights into drivers of prehistoric ﬁre regimes in the Canal
de Navarrés study area that would not be possible from the N3 charcoal
data alone.

drivers of ﬁre regimes. Future applications are not limited to the
emergence of agro-pastoral ﬁre regimes or the landscape used in the
comparison with the Canal de Navarrés. CharRec relies on fundamental
relationships between ﬁre regime components and charcoal dispersion,
as well as a user-deﬁned model landscape and ignition scenario inputs,
meaning it can be customized to operate in any landscape. Using many
of the same parameters, other nearby empirical charcoal records could
be simulated and compared to the results observed in the Canal de
Navarrés to evaluate the consistency of Neolithic land-use impacts
across the region. Other applications in the Mediterranean could include examining historical changes in ﬁre regimes related to documented land-use transitions, such as changes in land tenure during the
Medieval Islamic period (711 CE–1238) in Valencia or rural re-organization after the Black Death (1348 CE–1351) in the rest of western
Mediterranean (Claramunt Rodríguez et al., 2014). CharRec can be
employed to identify ﬁre regime drivers outside of Mediterranean
ecosystems by adapting the fuel models and landscapes the local speciﬁcs. New World applications may include identifying the degree to
which Native American burning practices have shaped pre-contact ﬁre
regimes in the currently ﬁre-prone western United States.
Simulating charcoal record formation through CharRec provides a
reliable method for identifying anthropogenic ﬁre in empirical sedimentary charcoal records and connecting the spatial and temporal dimensions of land-use to their formation. This work has implications for
understanding the pace and scale of human inﬂuence on ﬁre regimes
and landscape transformation in prehistory. With the emerging interest
in tracing the prehistoric roots of the Anthropocene, models like
CharRec are becoming increasing more important in answering the
diﬃcult and often tangled questions regarding the feedbacks between
humans and their environments in long-term-social ecological systems.
