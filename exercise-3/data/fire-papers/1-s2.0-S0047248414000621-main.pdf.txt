Siliceous rocks that were not heated to high temperatures during their geological formation display
improved knapping qualities when they are subjected to controlled heating. Experimental heat treatment of South African silcrete, using open ﬁres of the kind used during the Middle Stone Age, shows that
the process needed careful management, notwithstanding recent arguments to the contrary. Silcrete
blocks fractured when heated on the surface of open ﬁres or on coal beds, but were heated without
mishap when buried in sand below a ﬁre. Three silcrete samples, a control, a block heated underground
with maximum temperature between 400 and 500  C and a block heated in an open ﬁre with maximum
temperature between 700 and 800  C, were analysed with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray ﬂuorescence (XRF), optical microscopy, and both Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy.
The results show that the volume expansion during the thermally induced a- to b-quartz phase transformation and the volume contraction during cooling play a major role in the heat treatment of silcrete.
Rapid heating or cooling through the phase transformation at 573  C will cause fracture of the silcrete.
Successful heat treatment requires controlling surface ﬁre temperatures in order to obtain the appropriate underground temperatures to stay below the quartz inversion temperature. Heat treatment of
rocks is a transformative technology that requires skilled use of ﬁre. This process involves analogical
reasoning, which is an attribute of complex cognition.

Introduction
Living members of Homo sapiens have complex cognition that
includes attributes such as ﬂuid intelligence and innovative
thought (Wynn and Coolidge, 2011), abstract thought (Barnard,
2010), the ability to multi-task (Amati and Shallice, 2007), and
the use of recursion and concepts of past and future (Haidle, 2010;
Reuland, 2010). Executive functions of the brain that are dependent
on frontal lobe-linked abilities enable these cognitive attributes
and facilitate goal-directed actions, anticipation of problems,
response inhibition, planning over long distances or time, and
analogical reasoning (Coolidge and Wynn, 2001, 2005; Wynn and
Coolidge, 2003, 2011). The development of these cognitive attributes appears to have been gradual and incremental and it seems
possible to trace their presence through time using archaeological
evidence for various technologies. Advances are evident at the

beginning of the Middle Stone Age (MSA) about 300 000 years (ka)
ago, probably coinciding with the advent of H. sapiens. Backed tools
appeared in Zambia at about this time (Barham, 2002), and
Ambrose (2001, 2010) proposes that composite-tool making began
with this invention. He hypothesizes that the procedure involves
planning and coordination of numerous, separate tasks and that the
new behaviours evolved alongside frontal lobe development in the
human brain. Early composite-tool making is endorsed by the East
African discovery, at a similar age, of tiny stone points that would
have needed hafting for their effective use (Brooks et al., 2006).
Other attributes of complex cognition become apparent later in the
archaeological record, though future research is likely to shift the
chronological boundaries further back in time. As previously suggested (Wadley et al., 2009; Wadley, 2010a, 2013), the making of
compound adhesives involves not only careful planning, but also
multi-tasking, which is another attribute of complex cognition. The
manufacturing process requires combining diverse raw materials,
often from remote sources, and transforming them, usually irreversibly, through the use of pyrotechnology. The artisan needs to
simultaneously mix ingredients, control ﬁre temperature, and
mentally rotate stone tools to create the desired composite product.

Compound adhesive manufacture took place in Sibudu and Rose
Cottage, South Africa, by at least 70 ka (Wadley et al., 2004;
Lombard, 2006). An ochre-rich compound described as paint was
found in Blombos Cave in a layer dated to about 100 ka
(Henshilwood et al., 2011). The manufacture of this paint would
have required the same mental processes needed for compound
adhesive production.
Equipment designed to function, not immediately, but at a
future time, implies the cognitive ability to integrate action across
space and through time (Wynn and Coolidge, 2003), and it provides
another of the attributes denoting living H. sapiens cognition.
Snares are a good example of equipment used for remote capture of
prey. Being able to delay gratiﬁcation and envisage action removed
from supervision in both space and time engages modern executive
functions of the brain (Wynn and Coolidge, 2003). There is circumstantial evidence for the use of snares at Sibudu by 65 ka
(Wadley, 2010b), but future research may disclose an earlier origin.
The use of bow and arrow at a similar period (Lombard and
Phillipson, 2010) seems further evidence for thought processes
that were akin to our own. Lombard and Haidle (2012) argue that
such complementary tool sets imply cognitive ﬂexibility that would
enable the conceptualization of technological symbiosis.
Transformative technologies generate discernible links between
complex cognition and items of material culture. Recent examples
of transformative technologies that imply enhanced executive
functions include alloying metals and ﬁring ceramics (Wynn and
Coolidge, 2007). The innovative processes transform natural
products through combining raw materials prior to a sophisticated
use of pyrotechnology. Comparable transformative technologies
used earlier than metal working and ceramics include the creation
of compound adhesives and other compound products, which were
previously discussed, and also the deliberate heat treatment of rock
or ochre. This technology involves planning, patience and considerable expertise and understanding of the properties of all the
natural products involved. Here we argue that the introduction of
heat treatment also implies analogical reasoning and the ability to
envisage action removed from view. This attribute of complex
cognition has not previously been demonstrated through archaeological evidence. We explain the connection between heat treatment and analogical reasoning in more detail later.
The term heat treatment applies when heating is deliberate,
especially when ﬁre and rocks are simultaneously manipulated, but
arbitrating between deliberate and accidental heating of rocks can
be difﬁcult. When hearths are built above buried items such as
rocks, stone tools or botanical remains, these can burn and be
altered post-depositionally without this being the intention of the
artisans (Pierce et al., 1998; Sievers and Wadley, 2008; Asmussen,
2009). However, heat-treated siliceous rocks exhibit changes in
lustre (gloss) (Rowney and White, 1997) and sometimes in colour,
too. The ﬂaked surfaces of heat-treated rocks commonly have a
greasy lustre that is distinguishable from the dull outer surface of
the rock prior to it being struck (Purdy and Brooks, 1971; Rowney
and White, 1997). Gloss on heated stone tools is present in the
scars knapped after, and not before, heat treatment (Brown et al.,
2009). Making a distinction between accidental and deliberate
burning is therefore possible in these instances. A digital imaging
method that limits intra-analyst bias can distinguish colour of unburned and burned silcrete (Oestmo, 2013).
Controlled heating of siliceous rocks makes them better for
knapping than untreated rocks. For example, Brown et al. (2009)
found that thin bifacial points could be knapped with a higher
 ski
success rate on heated than unheated silcrete. Flints that Doman
et al. (2009) buried in sand, then subjected to slow heating and
cooling, exhibited substantial reduction in fracture toughness
(fracture toughness is measured in joules/mm2 and represents the

difﬁculty of propagating a crack through a substance). Flakes could
be knapped from these rocks using less energy than would have
been required without heating. Stone tool knappers who used heattreated rocks thousands of years ago may not have understood the
structural changes that took place, but they clearly knew that correct heating processes made siliceous rocks relatively easy to ﬂake
with effective end results. Changes made to siliceous rocks during
controlled heat treatment can facilitate not only ﬂake removal, but
also ﬁne pressure ﬂaking (Cotterell and Kamminga, 1992;
 ski and Webb, 1992; Webb and Doman
 ski, 2009; Mourre
Doman
et al., 2010). This retouching technique for shaping stone tools involves using a retoucher, such as a piece of bone, to exert pressure
close to a tool’s edge to produce distinctive, invasive scars (Mourre
et al., 2010). Pressure ﬂaking was once thought to be an Upper
Palaeolithic innovation that appeared about 20 ka ago, but recent
knapping experiments uphold the interpretation of pressure
ﬂaking on bifacial points excavated from the 75 ka Middle Stone
Age levels at Blombos Cave, South Africa (Mourre et al., 2010). The
Blombos silcrete points are said to have been heat treated after
initial ﬂaking, but prior to pressure ﬂaking (Mourre et al., 2010). In
other words, point preforms were heated; they would have been
smaller than silcrete cores, but larger than the ﬁnished points. Heat
treatment at Blombos is thus thought to have taken place during,
rather than before, the stone tool manufacturing process.
At another South African archaeological site, Pinnacle Point, all
twelve of the tested silcrete stone tools from PP5-6, and the Still Bay
biface from Blombos Sands, had been heated (Brown et al., 2009).
Some of the heat treated pieces are from 164 ka occupation layers.
The thermomagnetic history of these silcrete tools determines that
they were heated once only to maximum temperatures between
300  C and 400  C (Brown et al., 2009). This is precisely the range of
temperatures that Purdy and Brooks (1971) found most suitable for
heating chert.
Previous heat treatment research
The method of heating siliceous rocks affects their eventual
 ski et al. (2009) heated ﬂint pieces in a laborausefulness. Doman
tory oven to a peak temperature of 400  C that was held for 2 h.
Some experimental ﬂints were buried 30 mm deep in a sand bath in
the oven; others were exposed. When expansion and contraction
are rapid, fractures can be explosive (Purdy and Brooks, 1971), and a
high frequency of uncovered specimens exploded in the oven
 ski et al. (2009). This is said by these reduring heating by Doman
searchers to be the result of the high coefﬁcient of thermal
expansion of the quartz in siliceous rocks. They also conclude that
siliceous rocks, such as chert and ﬂint, remain undamaged when
heated to 300  C and 400  C, but rapid cooling or heating, or
temperatures above 400  C, produce brittleness and/or heat fracturing. The term heat fracturing describes the physical stresses
(that form fractures like crenation, potlidding, and surface crazing),
regardless of whether the heating was intentional or accidental
(Mercieca, 2000). While slow and steady heat treatment is one
solution, Mercieca and Hiscock (2008) conclude that this may not
be a necessity; heat treatment can sometimes be carried out in
aerobic conditions if the rock pieces to be heated are small enough.
This is because large items fracture at lower temperatures than
small ones, which have higher cracking and fracture thresholds.
Increasing specimen size reduces the resistance of the rock to heat
fracturing when suddenly exposed to heat (Mercieca, 2000).
Lithic blanks or preforms can be controlled for size more accurately than can temperature during the heating event (Mercieca
and Hiscock, 2008), thus knappers can exercise some control over
the outcomes of the heating process through standardizing rock
specimen size. Mercieca and Hiscock (2008) used differently sized

L. Wadley, L.C. Prinsloo / Journal of Human Evolution 70 (2014) 49e60

silcrete pieces to demonstrate their point: they cut experimental
blocks into 10  10  10 mm (1 cm3) for the smallest cubes and
40  40  40 mm (64 cm3) for the largest cubes. The 64 cm3 cubes
were more susceptible than the small cubes to undesirable fracture
during increases of temperature. The temperature above which
unwanted fracturing occurred in the small silcrete cubes varied
from 700  C to 900  C, but it was lower for the larger blocks. While
it seems that knappers might be able to use simple, open ﬁres to
heat treat the tiniest pieces of rock, it is clear that doing this with
larger blanks would be risky, notwithstanding the suggestion by
Schmidt et al. (2013) that South African silcrete can be treated in a
simple way on an open ﬁre or in coals scraped from such a ﬁre. An
added complication when heating a relatively large block of silcrete, even if it does not explode, is that water is not easily evacuated from its centre and heat treatment can be unsuccessful as a
result (Schmidt et al., 2013).
Not all siliceous rocks behave identically to the same thermal
conditions. Flint is of marine origin, while silcrete is a terrestrial
sedimentary rock and these geological distinctions produce structural differences that affect the behaviour of the rocks (Schmidt
et al., 2012a, 2013). Most heat treatment studies have been carried out on ﬂint. Flint does not occur in South Africa and, instead,
silcrete was heated and used by people who lived in the Southern
and Western Cape during the Middle Stone Age. This means that it
is really important to use South African rocks for experiments,
rather than relying on European observations on ﬂint.
Purdy and Brooks (1971) maintain that, during heating, the
quartz crystals in siliceous rocks recrystallize. Schmidt et al.
(2012a,b) argue against this and claim that heating leads to a loss
of silanol (SiOH) and the creation of new SieOeSi bonds, a reaction
that begins between 200  C and 300  C, resulting in increased
hardness in heated siliceous rocks. They suggest that ‘pore-closing’
and pore-water loss help to improve ﬂaking properties of silcrete,
most likely by making the rock more ﬁne-grained. When heating
relatively large pieces of ﬂint, pore water is not easily evacuated
from their centres (Schmidt et al., 2012a) and heat treatment may
be unsuccessful as a result.
Most experiments (save those by Brown et al., 2009) to heat
treat rocks have been conducted in laboratory furnaces. Electrical
furnaces reduce variables and enable consistent outcomes during
heating experiments, so the method has much to recommend it.

51

However, artisans that heat treated rocks in the Middle Stone Age
had to do it in the ﬁeld. They had to cope with variables inherent in
ﬁrewood, soil surfaces and rocks. The recent laboratory experiments with South African silcrete (Schmidt et al., 2013) contradict
the results of earlier ﬁeld-based experiments by Brown et al.
(2009). This suggests that laboratory and ﬁeld-based heat treatment experiments may have inherent inequalities. We conducted a
new ﬁeld-based experiment to examine the issue.
Experimental heat treatment methods
Silcrete preparation
A single large silcrete block was obtained from the Pinnacle
Point area. This was ﬁrst sliced with a diamond saw into ﬁve portions (numbers 1 to 5 in the experiments) and small blocks were
then cut from each slice (numbered for example 1ae1d from slice
1). Three sizes of blocks were cut to maximize the rock surface
(100  65  20 mm; 80  50  20 mm and 50  30  20 mm;
Table 1). The morphology of the original silcrete block meant that
slices and smaller blocks could not be cut accurately. The masses
and measurements of the small blocks are therefore not even
(Table 1). Before and after heating, the blocks were photographed,
weighed on a digital balance, and length, breadth and thickness
were measured with digital callipers.
Silcrete is not a homogeneous rock and two different phases can
be visually detected in some of the blocks (Fig. 1). The bulk of the
sample consists of a very hard greyish rock, which is difﬁcult to cut
even using a diamond saw. This hard phase is interspersed with a
light yellow to red powdery phase, which is easy to cut and even to
scrape off. When cutting the rocks in rectangles it was inevitable
that some of the powdery areas were included in the samples.
Fires 1 and 2 and Coal Beds 1 and 2
Fires were lit in the open on a sandy substrate. Soil moisture
readings were obtained with a Theta Probe soil moisture sensor
(Type ML2x) (Table 2). Acacia erioloba (an indigenous southern
African taxon) ﬁrewood was weighed and wood moisture readings
were taken using a MC-7825S moisture meter (Table 2).

allowed to cool underground before being excavated. All blocks
were weighed after cooling.
Optical microscopy
Thin sections of unheated and heated blocks were cut and these
were examined under plane and cross polarized light using an
optical microscope.
FTIR and Raman spectroscopy

Figure 1. Silcrete sample 2c after heating, showing the two phases that create an
inhomogeneous rock. The reddish powdery phase is at the top right and the remainder
of the sample is the hard, grey phase. The scale bar is 1 cm.

Small excavations were made into the sandy substrate and silcrete blocks were laid ﬂat on the level surfaces under both Fire 1
(blocks 1b, 1d, 2e and 3a) and Fire 2 (blocks 2c, 3b, 4b and 5b)
(Fig. 2). Thermoprobes were placed on the exposed surfaces of the
blocks, then blocks and probe tips were covered with 25 mm of
sand (Fig. 2). In the case of Fire 1, blocks 2b, 2d and 3d were placed
on the sand surface directly under the ﬁrewood (Fig. 2B). The ﬁre
was set using a ﬁre starter, twigs for tinder, and A. erioloba logs (see
Table 2 for mass of wood used). A thermoprobe was placed in the
middle of each tepee-shaped ﬁre and also near the ﬁre perimeter.
After lighting the ﬁres, the ﬁrst temperature readings were taken at
5 min and at 15 min thereafter, using Extech temperature data
loggers (HD200) with dual K-type thermoprobes, each 50 cm in
length. In the case of Fire 1, coals were removed after 2 h to create
separate Coal Bed 1. Blocks 3c, 4a and 5c were laid on the coal bed
and a thermoprobe was placed in its centre. The temperatures at
the top and base of the silcrete blocks were not equal even after 2 h,
so coals were then heaped on top of the blocks on the coal bed for a
further 2 h. The blocks were then removed from the coal bed and
also from the ﬁre. Coal Bed 2 was created from a ﬁre lit especially
for the purpose. Blocks 1c, 2a and 4c were laid on the coal bed
without being covered with additional coals. Buried blocks were

Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) transmission/absorbance
spectra of powdered samples were recorded using a Bruker Golden
Gate Attenuated Total Reﬂection (ATR) cell, which ﬁts into the
macro sample compartment of a Vertex 70v (Bruker Optics) spectrometer. The sample compartment was evacuated during acquisitions and the contact area between the sample and the diamond
ATR crystal is 2 mm diameter. Spectra were recorded with 64 acquisitions at 4 cm1 resolution over a spectral range of 8000e
600 cm1.
Infrared reﬂectance spectra were recorded using a Hyperion
microscope attached to the same Vertex 70v (Bruker Optics)
spectrometer. The samples were placed directly under the 10
microscope objective and a spot selected for analysis. The spectra
were then recorded using a 15 IR objective after optimizing the
focus to obtain the maximum signal. Spectra were recorded with
128 acquisitions at 4 cm1 resolution over a spectral range of
8000e600 cm1.
Micro-Raman spectroscopy was performed with a T64000
Raman spectrometer from HORIBA Scientiﬁc, Jobin Yvon Technology (Villeneuve d’Ascq, France). The 514.6 nm laser line of a mixed
gas KryptoneArgon laser (Coherent) was used as excitation source.
The 10, 50 or 100 objectives of an Olympus microscope were
used depending on the spot size of the area of interest. The spectra
were acquired using two acquisitions of 120 s with a spectral resolution of w2 cm1.
XRD and XRF measurements
In order to determine the elemental composition and mineralogical phases, the samples were powdered and analysed using Xray ﬂuorescence (XRF) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD).
The samples were milled in a tungsten carbide vessel and prepared for XRD analysis using a back loading preparation method
and then analyzed using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro powder diffractometer with X’Celerator detector and variable divergence- and
receiving slits with Fe ﬁltered Co-Ka radiation. The phases were
identiﬁed using X’Pert Highscore Plus software. The relative phase
amounts (weight%) were estimated using the Rietveld method
(Autoquan Program) (Table 3). Amorphous phases, if present, were
not taken into consideration in the quantiﬁcation.
The samples were dried at 100  C and roasted at 1000  C to
determine Loss On Ignition (LOI) values. For each sample, 1 g
Sample was mixed with 6 g Lithium teraborate ﬂux and fused at
1050  C to make a stable fused glass bead. The Thermo Fisher
ARL9400 XPþ Sequential XRF with WinXRF software was used for
analyses. Blank and certiﬁed reference materials are analysed with
each batch of samples and are included in the results.

(Table 1). The maximum temperature reached by Coal Bed 1 was
572.7  C. The ﬁre ramp rate was steep: after 5 min the ﬁre temperature had reached 460  C and by 15 min the temperature was
540.9  C. The underground ramp rate was considerably slower with
temperatures above 300  C being reached only after 1.5 h. Underground temperatures over 300  C were held for 3.7 h (Table 1).
The temperature in the centre of Fire 2 ramped to 530  C in
5 min and the maximum temperature reached was 765  C. The
perimeter of the ﬁre remained cooler (Fig. 3), reaching a maximum
temperature of 671  C after 2 h. Notwithstanding the variation in
temperatures at the perimeter and in the centre of the ﬁre, the two
underground temperatures developed similarly. All of the underground temperatures rose slowly and steadily and decreased in the
same way.
Coal Bed 2 was maintained for only 2.5 h, which is the period
that Schmidt et al. (2013) suggest is necessary for heat treatment of
silcrete. The maximum temperature reached was 520.8  C, achieved when the coals were ﬁrst scraped from the ﬁre.

The type and amount of ﬁrewood inﬂuence the above ground
temperatures and their duration. The A. erioloba used for the experiments maintained above ground temperatures of between
700  C and 600  C for several hours, produced good coals and
successfully heated the subsurface to between 400  C and 300  C.
Fire 1 burned 8.0 kg of wood and Fire 2 burned more wood (9.5 kg).
Notwithstanding the increase in the use of fuel in Fire 2, the ﬁre
performance was unaffected and neither maximum above nor
below ground temperatures were substantially different from those
achieved by Fire 1.

under Fire 2 remained whole. Blocks 1c and 2a remained whole on
Coal Bed 2, but the large block 4c fractured. Some heated blocks lost
mass (Table 1). The powdery phases turned bright red due to
oxidation to hematite of the iron-containing phases.

Optical microscopy
In Fig. 5, a micrograph (10 optical lens) under plane polarized
light of a thin section of a control sample is shown. The material is
very ﬁne grained with a dense and massive texture. Quartz grains
are surrounded by a dense microcrystalline to cryptocrystalline
quartz matrix. The anatase and/or rutile form part of the matrix,
most probably disseminated throughout the cement or matrix.
Lighter and darker areas are easily discernible showing an inhomogeneous distribution of some coloured phases. All of the bigger
quartz grains (in all three samples) show undulatory extinction,
implying stress. Optically, no real differences between the heated
and control sample were observed.
XRD and XRF
The XRD measurements determined that all three samples
consist of more than 95% a-quartz. Minor phases that were determined are titanium dioxide (rutile, anatase), a high temperature
phase of a-quartz, namely cristobalite, hematite and pyrocroite. The
accuracy for the minor phases might be questionable and inﬂuenced by the detection limits of the instrument, as well as the part
of sample analyzed, as the minor phases in silcrete are inhomogeneously distributed (see Fig. 5). Reliable quantiﬁcation of the
minor phases was therefore not possible.
The XRD results are in line with the XRF results (Table 3) with
SiO2 more than 95% for all three samples. The Loss on Ignition
values in Table 3 reﬂect the amount of volatiles lost during heating, but also the weight gained due to oxidation during heating,
mainly through the formation of hematite and elemental analysis
shows that Fe is present in all the samples. The values should be
interpreted together with the water loss of the samples in the ﬁre
experiments (see Table 1). The control sample was not heated
before analysis and it therefore reﬂects a maximum water loss as
well as maximum oxidation, which results in an overall weight
loss of 1.26%. This value is higher than the weight loss calculated
from the silcrete heated in the ﬁre experiments, where larger
samples were used and in which water may still be trapped even
after heating at the highest temperature. It can also be deduced
that the water loss was in fact greater as oxidation increased the
weight. Sample 2b was heated to 761.8  C in open air where
oxidation occurred on the outside of the sample and 0.36%
moisture was lost. Heating of a powdered sample of 2b to 1050  C
in the laboratory on balance resulted in a very small gain in
weight. Sample 3b was heated to 419.4  C with a water loss of
0.17% and, because the sample was buried, the minimum amount
of oxidation occurred. After roasting there was a 0.27% weight gain
attributed to oxidation.

FTIR/NIR
The silcrete samples used for FTIR and Raman analyses are
control pieces that were not heated, sample 2b (heated in open ﬁre
with a maximum temperature of 761.8  C, fractured) and 3b
(heated under ﬁre with a maximum temperature of 419.4  C, not
fractured) as described in Table 1. The mid-infrared absorbance
spectra of the powdered samples are identical with the strong peak
originating from SieO vibrations of a-quartz at 1053 cm1 dominating the spectra (see spectrum of control sample in Fig. 6). The
other main peaks are the characteristic 778/792 cm1 doublet
(Fig. 6) of a-quartz representing bending vibrations. In contrast to
Schmidt et al. (2013), bands that can be attributed to water or OH
groups were not observed between 3000 and 3800 cm1 or in the
Near Infrared Region (NIR) region (>4000 cm1) of the spectrum
where overtone bands occur. This might be because they recorded
transmission spectra of 1 mm thick slices of the sample, which
would result in stronger absorption than for powdered samples
recorded with the ATR cell where only the top surface of the sample
is probed. Another factor is that ATR measurements result in
spectra with lower absorption in the high wavenumber region due

Figure 6. Comparison of the FTIR absorbance spectra of the two different phases of the
control (unheated) silcrete sample recorded with an ATR (attenuated total reﬂection
cell) attachment.

to the dependence of the depth of penetration on the wavelength of
the incident light. However, comparison with the absorbance
spectrum of the powdery phase present in the control sample
(Fig. 6, top) shows that an organic phase is present by the
appearance of peaks attributed to CeH stretch and OeH vibrations.
This also has an inﬂuence on the SieO stretch vibrations, where the
large envelope of SeO vibrations is split. Traces of the organic
material might also be present in the solid part of the silcrete
samples as very small peaks at the same positions are also seen in
the spectrum of the control sample.
Reﬂectance infrared spectra were recorded on sample ﬂakes
that were detached in a way to simulate knapping of stone tools. As
the sample surfaces are not homogeneous, 20 spectra were recorded for each sample on different spots and were averaged using the
Opus software (Fig. 7). In contrast to the absorbance spectra, bands
originating from water and OH vibrations are clearly visible as the
intensity of surface species are enhanced in reﬂectance mode. The
decrease in the intensity of the water bands clearly shows that,
during the heating process, adsorbed water is lost as also observed
by Schmidt et al. (2013). This water loss is in accordance with the
data in Table 1 where the weight loss of sample 3b is 0.17% and for
sample 2b is 0.36%. The water loss was attributed by Schmidt and
colleagues to the loss of silanol groups on the quartz surface,
without taking into consideration that anatase and rutile also have
surface OH groups that will contribute to the water loss. It can also
be seen that the intensity of the reststrahlen bands (residual rays)
increases dramatically from the control sample to the heated
samples 3b (419.4  C) and 2b (761.8  C). This is most likely due to an
increase of crystallinity in the heated samples.
Raman spectroscopy
In Fig. 8 a selection of spectra recorded on a freshly ﬂaked surface of the control sample is presented. The most prominent bands
in the spectra originate from a-quartz and two different polymorphs of titanium dioxide, namely rutile and anatase (Table 4).
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) occurs in nature as three different polymorphs namely anatase, rutile and brookite, each with a different
crystal structure. Rutile is the most stable phase and anatase and
brookite reverts to rutile upon heating. Both rutile and anatase have
large Raman cross sections and although the intensity of the peaks

is quite high, it is not a reﬂection of the percentage of either of the
phases present in the sample (see XRF Table 3). In contrast, cristobalite, a high temperature phase of quartz, is present in the same
concentration range (Table 3) but was not detected in any of the
Raman spectra recorded of the samples as it does not have a strong
Raman spectrum. Hematite was also not detected in any of the
samples. The characteristic peaks for a-quartz, rutile, anatase and
the third phase of titanium oxide (TiO2), namely brookite, are
summarized in Table 4. Spectra (a) e (d) reﬂect the variation of
spectra recorded on the sample and all contain more than one of
the components with spectrum (a) nearly pure rutile, spectrum (d)
mostly quartz and spectrum (e) mainly anatase. In spectrum (c)
peaks belonging to brookite are also observed, but this was only
observed for a few sampling spots and is therefore not present in
any signiﬁcant concentration as conﬁrmed by XRF data (Table 3).
Raman spectra recorded on sample 3b heated at 420  C and
buried underneath the ﬁre did not differ much from those recorded
on the control sample. In contrast, in Fig. 9, a selection of spectra
recorded on sample 2b, heated in the ﬁre at 761  C, is given and it is
clear that there is a large variation in the position and full width at
half maximum (FWHM) of the characteristic peak of a-quartz at
464 cm1. A shift of peak position is an indication of stress in a solid
sample and a shift to lower wavenumbers indicates tensile stress
(due to volume increase), while a shift to higher wavenumbers is a
sign of compressive stress. A build up of stress is usually the cause
of fractures. Broadening of peaks implies an increase in disorder
and therefore suggests that large changes are taking place within
the quartz crystals.
Heating silcrete will lead to various temperature dependent
changes taking place in the sample. At normal pressure, trigonal
quartz (a-quartz) transforms progressively from 200 to 573  C into
hexagonal b-quartz at 573  C, at which temperature the transition
is instantaneous (Raman and Nedungadi, 1940). During the transition from a- to b-quartz, the atoms in the crystal lattice only get
slightly displaced relative to each other without breaking any SieO
bonds. The changes in the samples are not drastic, but are accompanied by a gradual increase of the thermal expansion coefﬁcient,
which becomes nearly inﬁnite near the transition point, where

after it drops to a small negative value (Raman and Nedungadi,
1940). During heating there is therefore a volume increase of
quartz crystals and it has been shown that the transition (at 573  C)
is accompanied by a prominent water loss originating from ﬂuid
inclusions (Barker and Robinson, 1984). In the ceramic industry this
phenomenon is known as the a- to b-quartz inversion, which is
accompanied by a volume increase of about 2e4% and can lead to
cracking of ceramic ware if heating/cooling occurs too quickly
through the inversion temperature (Kerr and Wood, 2004). In the
industry, this is known as ‘dunting,’ and the resultant faults as
‘dunts’ (Harman, 2000). To avoid such thermal shock faults, cooling
rates not exceeding 50  C/hour have been recommended. Furthermore, cracking caused by the a- to b-quartz inversion is recognized
in the ceramic industry from other kinds of fractures by a shiny
appearance along the break (Harman, 2000). The reported gloss in
the fresh scars of silcrete that has been knapped after heating is also
an indication that quartz inversion plays a major role in determining the properties of the heated samples.
The maximum temperature of the silcrete sample 3b, heated
underground, is below the a- to b-quartz phase transition, but the
increase in expansion coefﬁcient takes place from temperatures
>200  C, inducing stress in the crystals. The volume increase of
quartz crystals during this stage will promote the diffusion of ions/
water/organic phase or any defect out of the more open quartz
structure, and if cooling takes place at a slow rate the end product
will have fewer defects and therefore a higher degree of crystallinity than the original material. However, small hairline cracks
similar to those caused by uneven heating in an open ﬁre might also
be introduced in the structure by the heating and cooling process
and this might be the reason for improved knapping properties, but
further research is necessary to conﬁrm this suggestion. For sample
2b heated in the ﬁre, the temperature at 761  C is well above this
phase transition and it can be assumed that it took place, that water
was released from inclusions in the quartz, and that the reversion
back to a-quartz transpired upon cooling. However, in the spectra
in Fig. 9 the main peak of quartz appears in various positions between 464 cm1 and 459 cm1, which is the position of this peak in
b-quartz, indicating that the inversion back to a-quartz was
incomplete. The phase transition can be observed in Raman spectra
by the broadening and shifting to lower wavenumbers of the peaks
at 464 to 459 and 206 to 165 cm1, respectively, together with the
disappearance of the peak at 355 cm1 (Shapiro et al., 1967). This
shift of the 464 cm1 Raman peak upon heating, was also recorded
by Schmidt et al. (2012a) for chalcedony in ﬂint, In Fig. 9, the shift of
the 206 cm1 peak is also clearly visible. The spectrum of rutile is
included in the ﬁgure to show that the broadening of the 464 cm1
peak is not due to the overlap of the rutile peak at 440 cm1
because the other peaks of rutile are absent in the spectra. The
resultant material is a mixture of highly crystalline quartz, but with
remaining pockets of b-quartz residues that are under strain. This
can lead to future fracturing.

present according to the XRF results. Small peaks at the positions of
the zircon peaks were present in some spectra recorded on the
control sample; the spectrum of only zircon might indicate that the
crystal size of zircon has increased.
It is suggested that although there are other contributing factors,
quartz inversion is the main cause for fractures appearing in silcrete
samples heated in an open ﬁre. Developing techniques to avoid
cracking caused by this phenomenon requires the same skills
regardless of whether the people are from the Middle Stone Age in
South Africa, the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe, or from a modern
day ceramic factory. The solution is also the same, namely heating
and cooling at a very slow rate.
Discussion and conclusions

Figure 9. Examples of Raman spectra recorded on sample 2b that was heated in the
ﬁre to 761.8  C.

Quartz inversion is not the only cause for cracking in the ceramic
industry and also not in heated silcrete or concrete. Uneven heating
or cooling, pressure caused by water evaporation, or the combustion of organic material in the sample, can also play a role (Harman,
2000). Water loss/combustion of an organic phase (see Fig. 6)
during the heating experiments using large pieces of silcrete will
cause pressure inside the samples due to the formation of water
vapour/gas, which cannot escape. If the sample is then rapidly
cooled, the outside surfaces will cool faster than the rock centre
causing contraction, which will lead to fracturing. Such problems
can be avoided by heating and cooling the samples underground at
a slow rate. The changes taking place in silcrete during heating are
particularly complex if the anatase to rutile phase transition and
oxidation of iron phases to hematite are taken into account.
Anatase generally transforms to rutile at temperatures between
600 and 700  C, but many factors inﬂuence the exact temperature
(Hanoar and Sorrell, 2011). Two of these factors are stress and
reducing conditions, which ﬁt the conditions of the sample heated
underground where there is stress due to the volume increase of
the quartz particles, and a lack of oxygen. A spectrum recorded on
the red sphere in the image (Fig.10) is a rutile spectrum from the
heated sample, 2b. In the control sample pure rutile spectra (Fig. 8)
were recorded on yellowish particles, while in the heated samples
only red particles were visible. This is an indication that the red
colouring inside the heated samples originates from rutile. Synthetic rutile is white and used as a white pigment, but rutile formed
in nature is red and also derives its name from the red colour (Latin
‘rutilus’, meaning ‘reddish’). It is suggested that rutile contributes to
both the red colour and gloss of heated silcrete samples. Further
research is necessary to elucidate the precise role of the anatase to
rutile phase transition in the changed properties observed in
heated silcrete. In Fig. 11, the surface of a fragment of silcrete that
broke off in the ﬁre is shown. The red discolouration is typical of
these broken fragments and in Fig. 11 spectra are shown that were
recorded on the red line. Peaks typical of a disordered hematite can
be distinguished as well as spectra of a- and b-quartz. Iron oxides
and hydroxides are oxidized to hematite in normal atmospheric
conditions and for samples heated in the ﬁre the oxidation process
will start on the outside edges, bringing further stress to the sample. A spectrum of zircon was also recorded on the red part of the
sample. Zircon was not detected with XRD measurements, but Zr is

All silcrete blocks heated experimentally in an open ﬁre fractured, so this ﬁrst method of heat treatment seems unsatisfactory.
Reasons for fracturing on open ﬁres were discussed in detail in the
Results section. Rapid surface heating can induce large stresses in
solids, possibly leading to surface roughening, yielding, or fracture.
Raman spectra recorded on sample 2b, a silcrete block heated in the
ﬁre at 761  C, illustrate a large variation in the position and full
width at half maximum (FWHM) of the characteristic peak of aquartz at 464 cm1. A shift of peak position is an indication of stress
in a solid sample, and build up of stress is usually the cause of
fractures. Broadening of peaks implies disorder and this demonstrates that large changes are taking place within the quartz crystals. In the case of sample 2b, and almost certainly also in the case of
the other blocks heated in open ﬁres or coal beds, the a- to b-quartz
inversion, accompanied by a volume increase of about 2e4% would
have contributed to the fracturing.
Secondly, rocks were heated on coals scraped from the ﬁre. Fifty
percent of our experimentally heated silcrete blocks fractured using
this method.
Thirdly, we buried silcrete blocks for underground heating. The
reducing environment underground provided a safe and reliable
environment for heating the rocks and all of the experimental
blocks that were buried were successfully heat treated without
damage. Raman spectra recorded on sample 3b heated at 420  C
and buried in sand underneath the ﬁre did not differ much from

those recorded on the control sample, which received no heat at all.
The reducing environment also inhibits the oxidation reaction of
iron to hematite, which can contribute to stress in the material,
resulting in fractures. The challenge when heating buried silcrete is
to obtain and sustain an underground temperature of between
300  C and 400  C for sufﬁcient time to heat the interior of the
rocks.
Our results undoubtedly contradict some of those of Schmidt
et al. (2013), who argue that silcrete can be heat treated quite
simply in a ﬁre or on embers. They had high success rates heat
treating silcrete from the Diepkloof area under aerobic conditions
in an electrical furnace. Why might the two sets of results be so
dissimilar? We can think of several possibilities, but there may be
others that we have not thought of. First, ﬁres lit in the ﬁeld heat
rocks differently from those in electrical furnaces. Rocks in open
ﬁres or on coal beds make direct contact with ﬂaming wood or
searing coals; rocks in electrical furnaces contend only with hot air.
Secondly, geological variations between the Diepkloof and Pinnacle
Point silcrete may produce different thermal reactions. Schmidt
et al. (2013) alluded to this possibility after one ﬂake fractured
during an experiment to test the effects of placing silcrete ﬂakes in
an oven pre-heated to 550  C. Chemical signatures of silcretes

developed in association with different bedrock types are indeed
different, to the extent that they can be used in provenancing (Nash
et al., 2013).
thirdly, the main experiment by Schmidt et al. (2013) involved
slowly heating silcrete slabs cut to a thickness of approximately
0.5 mm, whereas our blocks were considerably larger and were cut
to sizes intended to replicate those of tool preforms. It is well
known that the size of particles used for thermal analyses has a
direct inﬂuence on the results (Flüglein, 2013) and as Mercieca
(2000) points out, the size of silcrete blocks is relevant to heat
treatment because large rocks fracture at lower temperatures than
small ones. Water loss during the heating experiments with larger
pieces of silcrete will cause stress inside the sample due to the
formation of water vapour/gas, which cannot escape. If the sample
is then rapidly cooled, the outside surfaces will cool fast causing
contraction, which will result in fracture because the internal part
of the sample cools at a different rate. The decrease in the intensity
of the water bands plainly shows that adsorbed water is lost during
heating, as was also observed by Schmidt et al. (2013). They
attributed water loss to the loss of silanol groups on the quartz
surface. They did not take into account that anatase and rutile also
have surface OH groups that contribute to water loss in the silcrete.

L. Wadley, L.C. Prinsloo / Journal of Human Evolution 70 (2014) 49e60

The intensity of the reststrahlen bands (residual rays) increases
radically from the control sample to the heated samples 3b
(419.4  C) and 2b (761.8  C), and this change most likely occurred
when crystallinity increased in the heated samples. Recrystallization was proposed as the cause of mechanical transformations in
 ski and Webb, 1992; Doman

heated ﬂint (Doman
conclusion that is not supported by researchers such as Schmidt
et al. (2012a). Nonetheless, our results conﬁrm that although
recrystallization did not take place, crystallinity increased in our
heated silcrete samples.
Electrical furnaces maintain standardized conditions and reduce
the numbers of variables in experiments. They play an important
role in the investigation of conditions under which natural products change. However, they do not truly reproduce situations faced
by people who lived during the Middle Stone Age. Changeable or
unpredictable conditions are inevitable in ﬁeld-based ﬁres where
the ramp rate can be rapid and the ﬁre can reach high temperatures
quickly. It consequently seems risky to place items for heat treatment directly in an open ﬁre, and such behaviour seems impractical
when rock sources are distant and effort is invested in preform
production. It seems more probable that people in the Middle Stone
Age heat treated preforms by burying them just below the ground
surface, and lighting a ﬁre or placing coals on sand above the buried
rocks. This method of heat treatment would allow the simultaneous use of the ﬁre for domestic purposes and would not require a
special ﬁre. As demonstrated by Fire 1, it is possible to heat at least
four preforms simultaneously under a small ﬁre using about 8 kg of
wood. The use of 9.5 kg of wood in Fire 2 did not substantially increase the temperatures achieved by this ﬁre compared with those
of Fire 1.
Since no measuring instruments were available in the Middle
Stone Age, people needed to know the thermal properties of ﬁrewood from local tree taxa. They also needed to understand relationships between ﬁre temperatures, fuel load, duration of heat,
and the items that they sought to transform. Thermal relationships
are even more elaborate for anaerobic heating. The heating of
buried items is affected by depth of burial and the texture of the
substrate (Sievers, 2013), as well as properties of the surface ﬁre.
The artisan must therefore control underground temperatures
indirectly through management of surface temperatures and the
substrate in which the items are buried. A mental algorithm must
be calculated based on a ﬁre’s above ground performance. This
process requires analogical reasoning and thinking about the
qualities of out-of-sight rocks and the changes being wrought to
them. Heat treatment is a good example of a transformative technology that involves not only analogical thought and response inhibition, but also organization across space and time, contingency
planning, mental rehearsal and thought experiment e all attributes
that Wynn and Coolidge (2009) attribute to enhanced executive
functions of the brain. In this regard, the results of our experiments
complement previous research that points to other proxies for
complex cognition in the MSA, for example, snares, compound
adhesives and paints, and perforated, ochre-coloured sea shells
(Wadley et al., 2009; Wadley, 2010b; Henshilwood et al., 2011;
Vanhaeren et al., 2013).
It is true that the concept of underground heating of rocks may
have been discovered accidentally, for example during raking out
disused ﬁreplaces, but the success of the transformation implies
achieving speciﬁc temperatures for the product being heated. Siliceous rocks that have been heated and subsequently knapped
exhibit a distinct gloss that can be quantitatively measured on
freshly exposed surfaces (Brown et al., 2009).
We have shown that cognitive attributes that we recognize in
ourselves, for example, analogical reasoning and the ability to
multi-task, were needed for heat treating rocks. Both analogical

59

reasoning and the ability to control action remotely imply cognitive
abilities characteristic of people like us. Analogical reasoning is the
sine qua non of H. sapiens brains (Wynn and Coolidge, 2009).
Although Mourre et al. (2010) demonstrate that silcrete cannot be
pressure ﬂaked without heat treatment, heat treatment is not a
technical necessity for producing effective tools. At Sibudu, for
example, stone knappers created well-shaped segments (crescents)
and Still Bay bifacial points from rocks like hornfels and dolerite
that were not heat treated, and which would not have been
responsive to heat treatment because of their geological histories.
Accordingly, when heat treatment unquestionably occurs, it provides an example of decoupling technical need and production
method. It connects the social realm with that of technology, in
addition to demonstrating the cognitive complexity of the people
making use of heat treatment.
