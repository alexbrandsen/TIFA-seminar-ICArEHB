Charcoal is a valuable source of archaeological and palaeoenvironmental proxy data. However growing
evidence suggests that production conditions can strongly inﬂuence post-depositional alteration of
charcoal. Consequently, both reconstruction of production temperature and understanding of the
potential for diagenetic alteration are of great interest. Here, we use mean random reﬂectance (Romean)
in conjunction with other chemical characterization methods to address these questions. Romean was
obtained for a suite of modern analogue charcoal, produced under controlled conditions, and for
a series of natural charcoal samples, obtained from archaeological and palaeoenvironmental deposits.
Romean proves to be a robust measure to assess formation temperature for samples produced at 400  C
and above, even after exposure to highly oxidizing conditions. Romean is also useful for samples formed
between 300  C and 400  C. However, if an assemblage of charcoals has been exposed to oxidizing
conditions, lower temperature charcoals may be preferentially lost. It is apparent that charcoal
produced at lower temperatures is more highly susceptible to chemical oxidation, and that there is
a continuum in charcoal degradation potential, dependant upon fuel material and production
conditions.

1. Introduction
Charcoal production involves exposure of biomass to elevated
temperatures under conditions of restricted oxygen, and is among
the oldest forms of human chemical technology (e.g. Moore, 2000).
During production, the most prominent chemical change is reorganization of lignocellulosic structures into highly stable condensed
polyaromatic conﬁgurations (Darmstadt et al., 2000; Eckmeier et al.,
2007). Charcoal is consequently among the forms of environmental
carbon most resistant to alteration and degradation (Levine, 1991;
Preston and Schmidt, 2006), displaying remarkable persistence
within the geological record (Pessenda et al., 1996; Collinson et al.,
2000; Gouveia et al., 2002; Scott, 1989, 2000, 2009; Scott and
Glasspool, 2007). Charcoal therefore forms a valuable source of
geological, archaeological and palaeoenvironmental proxy data

(Scott, 2010), not least as one of the most common materials
submitted for radiocarbon (14C) age measurement (Bird, 2006).
Long-term preservation makes it tempting to consider charcoal
as chemically homogeneous, and uniformly recalcitrant. However,
charcoal is neither a pure form of carbon, nor a single compound,
but comprises a range of substances, the nature of which are heavily
inﬂuenced by production conditions and fuel materials (Antal and
Gronli, 2003). It is apparent that, along with highly stable, graphitelike polyaromatic ‘organized’ domains, charcoal can contain
a variety of other carbon-based chemical structures (Pastorova et al.,
1994; Baldock and Smernik, 2002; Ascough et al., 2008b). These
comprise a complex disorganized phase containing aliphatic and
aromatic moieties. This ‘disorganized’ phase appears to be more
susceptible to diagenetic alteration than the organized phase
(Cohen-Ofri et al., 2006). The presence of both organized and
disorganized phases is also a feature of ancient archaeological
charcoal samples (Cohen-Ofri et al., 2006) and is signiﬁcant because
different charcoal samples display variable resistance to environmental diagenesis. For example, charcoal carbon degradation has

P.L. Ascough et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 37 (2010) 1590–1599

been observed on the order of decades in a Zimbabwean savannah
soil (Bird et al., 1999) and virtually complete loss of charcoal due to
ﬂuctuating groundwater levels is recorded at an Australian
archaeological site (Bird et al., 2002). However both the diagenetic
processes affecting charcoal and the factors that determine the
susceptibility of charcoal to these processes remain poorly
understood.
Temperature-dependant chemical changes directly dictate the
elemental and isotopic composition, physical appearance, and
chemical structure of charcoal (Antal and Gronli, 2003; Kim and
Hanna, 2006; McParland et al., 2007; Hall et al., 2008). These factors
are likely to strongly inﬂuence post-depositional behaviour.
Therefore reconstruction of charcoal production temperatures is of
great interest. Possible production temperatures vary considerably,
with 300–600  C being typical of natural ﬁres (e.g. Swift et al., 1993).
Data from natural wildﬁres suggests a range of <400  C–800  C
(Stinson and Wright, 1969; Stronach and McNaughton, 1989), while
estimated production temperatures for charcoal in Roman hypocaust furnaces is 330–410  C (McParland et al., 2009a). Traditional
methods of anthropogenic charcoal production have a range of 300–
800  C (McParland et al., 2009b), while industrial processes such as
pottery ﬁring tend to involve higher temperatures up to and over
800  C (Livingstone-Smith, 2001). Approaches to reconstruct
production temperature include analysis of isotopic signatures and
elemental compositional changes induced during heating (e.g.
Werts and Jahren, 2007; Braadbaart and Poole, 2008). However
complicating factors must be considered, including species-speciﬁc
carbon isotopic responses to pyrolysis and chemical exchange
during post-depositional diagenesis (e.g. Bird et al., 2002; Turney
et al., 2006; Ascough et al., 2008b).
An alternative approach to determining charcoal formation
temperature is mean random reﬂectance (Romean), derived from
photometric measurement of the fraction of incident light radiation
reﬂected from a sample surface under oil. Romean is shown to have
a positive relationship with formation temperature (Jones et al.,
1991; Scott and Glasspool, 2005, 2007; McParland et al., 2007,
2009b, Scott and Jones, 1991), and is suitable for analysis of both
ancient and freshly-produced charcoal samples (Jones et al., 1991;
Scott and Jones, 1994; McParland et al., 2007, 2009a; Braadbaart
and Poole, 2008; Hudspith et al., 2010). Evidence from coal macerals indicates Romean values increase with the fraction of aromatic
carbon within a sample (Stach et al., 1982), meaning Romean
measurements may also provide valuable information on the
chemistry of charcoal samples.
To assess the use of Romean measurements in charcoal analysis
requires consideration of a number of factors; in particular the
potential effects of diagenetic alteration on Romean measurements.
To achieve this, several different methods can be used, providing
information on different aspects of samples. Such an approach is
necessary because of initial heterogeneity in the chemical
compounds present in different charcoal samples, and the additional variation introduced by diagenetic alteration. Here, we
present the results of such a study, using a suite of modern
analogue, natural and archaeological charcoal samples, where
Romean measurements are used in conjunction with a variety of
other characterization techniques. H/C ratio is used to assess
pyrolysis efﬁciency, while O/C ratio provides a measure of the
degree of oxidation of a sample (Nguyen et al., 2004; Schmidt et al.,
2001). Raman spectroscopy enables an estimation of the size and
content of aromatic domains in carbonaceous materials (Tuinstra
and Koenig, 1970), and the level of sample thermal reactivity can be
established via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Sima-Ella et al.,
2005). In this way, the interplay between charcoal production
mechanisms and the subsequent potential for post-depositional
alteration is addressed.

2. Methodology
2.1. Charcoal samples
The ﬁrst sample set (Table 1), comprised freshly-produced
laboratory analogue charcoal (fresh charcoal ¼ Frchar) from two
species. These were a low-density (0.41  0.05 g/m3) gymnosperm
(Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Tentsmuir Forest, Fife), and a high
density (0.88  0.03 g/m3) angiosperm, (mangrove (Rhizophora
apiculata Blume), northeast Palawan, Philippines). Bark was
removed and the wood processed by cutting into 1 cm3 cubes before
conversion to charcoal in a controlled-atmosphere rotary furnace
(CarboliteÔ). The furnace was continuously purged with nitrogen at
a constant metered ﬂow rate of 7.0 L min1 and ramped at
10  C min1 from room temperature to four ﬁnal temperatures
between 300 and 600  C, representing a typical range to which
wood is heated in natural ﬁres (e.g. Swift et al., 1993) and over which
major chemical changes are known to occur (Williams and Besler,
1996). Temperature was monitored via a thermocouple inserted
into a cube of wood in the furnace and the ﬁnal temperature was
held for 60 min, after which samples were cooled to room
temperature under N2. An aliquot of each charcoal was retained for
reﬂectance measurement. Charcoal was ground to <500 mm and
treated with 0.5 M HCl to remove calcitic ash before neutralization
and wet-sieving to 63–500 mm followed by drying at 40  C overnight. Analogue charcoal sample codes (Table 1) relate to the wood
species (P ¼ Pine (P. sylvestris); M ¼ Mangrove (R. apiculata)) and
temperature of formation (300–600  C).
The second sample set comprised environmental charcoal
(Envchar) samples (Env-1–Env-6), from six archaeological/palaeoenvironmental deposits of various ages, obtained via consultation
with specialists involved in site excavation or archaeobotanical
analysis (Table 1). Visible mineral material was removed from the
charcoal via sonication with deionized H2O for 24 h. A single, large
charcoal fragment was selected from each deposit for processing
and split into two aliquots. One aliquot was treated identically to
the modern analogue samples (i.e. HCl followed by wet-sieving to
63–500 mm). The other aliquot was retained for measurement of
sample reﬂectance.
Env-1 was sampled from trees charred in situ within paroxysmal
ﬂow deposits of the Maninjau caldera, west-central Sumatra
(53 400  1400 14C yrs BP (Alloway et al., 2004)), consisting of
crudely stratiﬁed pumiceous lapilli and ash, overlain by andisol and
basaltic-andesite lapilli layers (Alloway et al., 2004). Env-2 was
recovered from a concentration of undated charcoal fragments

within a lahar deposit developed from basaltic eruptions from
scoria cones spread along eruptive ﬁssures at Praia do Norte,
northwest Faial Island, Azores (F. Tempera, pers comm.; Cruz et al.,
2006).
Env-3 and Env-4 were recovered from the basal ﬁll of Icelandic
Norse-period charcoal production pits. Env-3 was obtained in
southern Iceland at Langanes, previously dated to between
935  35 and 960  35 14C yrs BP, while Env-4 was obtained from
vatnsveit, previously dated to
deposits close to Höskulsstaðir, My
895  35 BP (Church et al., 2007). In both cases, following ﬁnal use
of the pit, the basal ﬁll was covered with disturbed soil and turf,
followed by w500 years of natural soil accumulation (Church et al.,
2007).
Env-5 was located in ﬂuvial deposits of red sand and clay at Toca
do Serrote da Bastiana, a rock shelter containing calcite deposits, in
a Precambrian limestone outcrop in northeast Brazil (Steelman et
al., 2002). The charcoal was recovered from a discontinuous layer at
a depth of >50 cm, overlying several burials dated to between 200
and 150 years BP (Guidon, N., pers comm). Finally, Env-6 was
recovered from a pile of charred wood within a house structure
dated to ca.1050 AD at Oursi-hubeero, a settlement site in the Sahel
region of Burkina Faso (Hallier and Petit, 2000, 2001). The deposits
containing the charcoal were covered by sandy soils with clay
inclusions derived from degradation of the mud brick structure
(Höhn, 2005; Hohn pers comm).
2.2. Reﬂectance measurements
Individual charcoal fragments were embedded in resin and
polished, then studied (using standard techniques for coal
petrography) under a Nikon microphot microscope attached to
Leica QWin image analysis software (Leica Image systems Ltd.,
1997). Reﬂectance was measured under Cargill immersion oil
(refractive index of 1.518 at 23  C) using the 40 objective lens,
illuminated with a 546 nm light source. The instrument was
calibrated against ﬁve standards (Spinel (Romean 0.393), yttriumaluminium garnet (Romean 0.929), gadolinium-gallium garnet
(Romean 1.7486), cubic zirconium (Romean 3.188) and silicon
carbide (Romean 7.506)). Reﬂectance measurements were made at
100 points per sample in order to calculate Romean and standard
deviation (SD) of Romean.

2.4. Elemental analysis
Carbon abundance (wt%) was measured in a Costech elemental
analyser (EA) with a zero-blank auto-sampler, while oxygen and
hydrogen abundance (wt%) was determined using high-temperature
ﬂash pyrolysis in a ThermoFinnigan High-Temperature Conversion
Elemental Analyser (TC/EA). Samples were measured in duplicate
with laboratory standards and blanks. Both the EA and TC/EA were
coupled through a ThermoFinnigan ConFlo III to a ThermoFinnigan
Delta XL Plus mass spectrometer. Elemental abundances were
calculated using comparison of gas pulse peak area and mass to that
of acetanilide (IAEA/Sigma Aldrich, %C: 71.09%, %O: 11.84%, %H:
6.71%), where the external reproducibility was better than 0.5%, 0.7%
and 0.4% for C, O and H, respectively.
2.5. Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopic measurements were made of Frchar
prepared at 300  C and 600  C, and of Envchar samples that gave high
(Env-1 and Env-2) and low (Env-5 and Env-6) Romean values. A
compacted pellet of powdered charcoal was produced from each
individual sample prior to analysis. Measurements were made at the
Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, in air at room temperature
using a Renishaw 2000 Raman Imaging Microscope through
a 50 lens without a polarizer. The excitation at 632 nm was
produced by a 25 mw HeNe laser. Each measurement was made 8
times at random locations on each charcoal pellet, and the maximum
peak height and peak position were determined and averaged.
2.6. TGA
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on the
analogue charcoal prepared at 300  C and 600  C and on environmental charcoal using a ‘Thermal Analysis’ SDT Q600 TGA/DSC.
Samples were heated at 50  C min1 to 525  C under nitrogen to
facilitate removal of volatiles, and mass loss due to volatile decomposition was calculated. Upon reaching 525  C, the samples were
isothermally combusted in air for 20 min and carbon burnout
proﬁles generated. Two quantitative measures of reactivity were
then taken; ﬁrstly a time until 90% carbon conversion and, secondly,
pseudo-ﬁrst order kinetics were applied, between 5 and 95% carbon
burnout, to allow the calculation of a composite rate constant via:

2.3. Dichromate oxidation and SEM/TEM
Frchar was digested via a modiﬁed Walkley-Black method in
acidiﬁed potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) (Bird and Gröcke, 1997).
This methodology is commonly used in separation of fractions
within carbonized biomass, where non-aromatic material, (e.g.
cellulose), is preferentially removed (Wolbach and Anders, 1989;
Bird and Gröcke, 1997). Brieﬂy, cubes of charcoal were placed in
0.1 M K2Cr2O7/2M H2SO4 solution at 60  C in an incubator shaker
for 72 h. For the 300  C analogue charcoal this time period resulted
in complete breakdown and dissolution, and a reduced oxidation
period of 24 h was used. After oxidation samples were neutralized
by washing with deionized water and freeze-dried. Oxidative
weight losses were recorded with a precision of 3%, based upon
replicate analyses.
Oxidized charcoal samples were examined and split open to
characterize any visual differences following oxidation. Where any
visible alteration was observed, light microscopy and Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses were performed. Specimens
for TEM were embedded in Spurr Resin prior to sectioning by
ultramicrotome. The ultra-thin sections, cut with a diamond knife,
and not stained, were imaged with a Hitachi H7600 transmission
electron microscope (TEM).

3. Results
3.1. Reﬂectance
Romean values for Frchar range between 0.03  0.01 for M-300 to
4.01  0.52 for M-600 (Table 2), and are consistent with those
observed in previous studies (Scott, 1989; Jones et al., 1991; Guo
and Bustin, 1998). Although mangrove charcoal Romean is slightly
higher than pine at 500–600  C, Romean from both species is
consistently within analytical error, and is strongly correlated
(r2 ¼ 0.99, P < 0.05) with production temperature (Fig. 1) following

calibration accurately reﬂect the known temperature to 15  C.
Calculated production temperatures for Envchar via the calibration
are 515  33  C for Env-1 (Romean ¼ 2.51  0.45) and 497  25  C for
Env-6 (Romean ¼ 2.26  0.33). For Env-3, Env-4 and Env-5,
a temperature range of 351  23  C to 361  25  C is obtained, while
the lowest production temperature, 320  29  C, is calculated for
Env-2. We note, however that reﬂectance increases slightly with
time for up to 24 h (Scott and Glasspool, 2005; McParland et al.,
2009b) meaning charring experiments of longer durations are
needed to provide precise formation temperatures. However,

1593

comparisons of reﬂectance and temperature derived from the 1 h
curves do appear to approximate to known and inferred temperatures from studies of wildﬁre charcoals (Scott and Jones, 1994; Scott,
2000).
3.2. Dichromate oxidation
The Romean of Frchar produced at 400  C and above is not
signiﬁcantly different after oxidation for either species (Table 2).
Observable changes in mass after K2Cr2O7 oxidations were only
recorded in P-300 and M-300 (Table 2), with respective mass loss of
73% and 36%. High loss rates and physical sample breakdown
during oxidation meant reliable recovery of sufﬁcient material for
reﬂectance measurement was not possible from P-300 and M-300.
After oxidation, visible alteration was only apparent in P-300,
consisting of a lightening in colour of the outer sample surface.
Light microscopy (Fig. 2) revealed these colour changes were
limited to the outer few sample cells, and provided no strong
evidence for structural alteration. Although TEM analysis of cell
walls in the region of colour change showed slight evidence for
thinning, this was of very limited extent (Fig. 3). The mass loss in
300  C charcoals is therefore likely to relate to the removal of
chemical compounds, without major alteration of the charcoal
physical structure.
3.3. Elemental analysis
Carbon content of Frchar showed a strong, non-linear dependence on temperature (Table 3). Carbonized materials fall into
discreet regions on two-dimensional van Krevelen diagrams
depending upon their elemental content (Van Krevelen, 1950;
Hockaday et al., 2007), and a diagram of the Frchar shows linear
decrease in O/C and H/C ratios with temperature. Atomic ratios are

correlation between Romean and production temperature for measured samples. Note that graphical data for different sample types overlap at 300  C, 400  C and 500  C, meaning
some data points are obscured at these temperatures.

equivalent production temperature. For Env-1, the O/C and H/C
ratios are consistent with those of equivalent Frchar. However in the
remainder of Envchar the atomic ratios differ from that of equivalent
Frchar. In Env-2 and Env-5 both H/C and O/C ratios are higher than
equivalent (i.e. w320–350  C) analogue samples. In Env-3 and Env4 the O/C atomic ratio is consistent with w300  C analogue
samples, meaning the O/C atomic ratio is slightly higher than
expected. For these samples the H/C ratios are lower than that
predicted for this temperature from the Ro data, being more similar
to the analogue charcoals produced at w450  C. In Env-6 although
the H/C atomic ratio is consistent with those of equivalent (i.e.
w500  C) analogue charcoal, the O/C atomic ratio is more similar to
that of analogue charcoal produced at w300  C (Fig. 2). It may be
noted that comparisons are broad as the exact charring times of the
environmental charcoal samples are not known.

highly similar between species at 400  C (Fig. 4). However, there
is an offset in H and O content between pine and mangrove that is
most apparent at 300  C, where mangrove charcoal contains
signiﬁcantly less of these elements and hence appears more efﬁciently charred.
Using the Romean-based production temperature, the atomic
ratios for each Envchar were compared with those of Frchar for an

3.4. Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy provides information on the molecular
structure and chemical bonding of carbon atoms. The Raman
spectra of graphitic carbon contains a band at 1575 cm1 (the G
band), assigned to in-plane stretching motions of carbon sp2 atoms
(Tuinstra and Koenig, 1970), representing highly stable, ordered
carbon conﬁgurations. A second band at 1350 cm1 (the D band)
represents disordered carbon conﬁgurations, arising from defects
and discontinuities in crystallites, and has been assigned to carbons
with an sp3 conﬁguration, not located in graphitic layers, likely to

be tetrahedrally bonded (Tuinstra and Koenig, 1970; Dresselhaus
et al., 2000; Fey and Kao, 2002; Fung et al., 1993). Samples with
narrower G bands, positioned closer to 1575 cm1 contain
increasing area and amount of ordered, microcrystallite domains
(Tuinstra and Koenig, 1969; Knight and White, 1989).
Raman peaks in spectra of P-600 and M-600 are more highly
resolved, suggesting greater chemical homogeneity compared P-300
and M-300 (Table 4). The presence of a G peak indicates some
organized graphitic microcrystallites are present in both 300  C and
600  C charcoal, however the narrower G peaks at lower frequencies
(1584 cm1) suggests a more highly ordered carbon structure in P600 and M-600. The G peak positions also suggest a slightly higher
proportion of ordered carbon in mangrove charcoal. The position of
the D peaks is not conclusively different between the samples,
however these are considerably broader in the 300  C charcoals.
The presence of a G peak also indicates a proportion of organized
carbon domains within the Envchar. Samples Env-1 and Env-6
closely resemble the 600  C Frchar, with narrow G peaks at
w1584 cm1. In contrast, the Raman spectra of Env-5 and Env-2
more closely resemble the 300  C analogue samples, with broad G
peaks centred at 1590–1600 cm1 (Table 4). In these samples, the D
peaks are also broader and positioned at a higher frequency than
that of Env-1 and Env-5. Overall, the degree of structural order in the

analogue and environmental samples can be broadly related to
Romean, with higher Romean in samples showing narrow G peaks at
a lower frequency (Fig. 5).
3.5. TGA
Sample reactivity during TGA relates to the thermal resistance of
its molecular content. The bond energies of individual aromatic
rings are w193.71 Kcal mol1, and can be much higher as the size of
polyaromatic structures increases (Maitland, 2005). Bond energies
in non-aromatic components, such as C–C (80.711 Kcal mol1) and
C–H (92.241 Kcal mol1), can be much lower, and these are broken
at an earlier stage in TGA. Following devolatilization, the time taken
for sample burnout increases proportionally to chemical stability.
Charcoal with a higher proportion of non-aromatic structures has
lower thermal stability, and is therefore expected to show i.) higher
mass loss during devolatilization, and ii.) decreased burnout times
and composite ﬁrst order rate constants.
In Frchar the reactivity of pine charcoal is clearly higher than that
of mangrove for both 300  C and 600  C charcoals (Table 5), with
similar time to 90% burnout in both M-300 and P-600 (7.4 versus
7.3 min, respectively). In both species there is a large difference in
volatile content between 300  C and 600  C charcoal, with w30–

to w6% volatiles in P-600 and M-600, indicating much higher
content of non-aromatic compounds in the 300  C charcoal.
In Envchar, Env-1 and Env-6 show high thermal stability, with
burnout times and ﬁrst order rate constants similar to M-600. Volatile content in Env-1 is comparable to the 600  C analogue samples,
however Env-6 contains w20% volatile material. The remaining four
Envchar samples are more reactive, generally intermediate between P300 and P-600. In this group, Env-3 is the most thermally stable, and
Env-4 the least, and it appears that these samples contain a relatively
high proportion of material in a chemical form that is more susceptible to thermal degradation.
4. Discussion
4.1. Analogue charcoal: relationship between production
temperature, chemical characteristics and Romean
The results clearly demonstrate the strong relationship between
production temperature and chemical characteristics in charcoal.
At higher production temperatures, O/C and H/C ratios of Frchar fall.
This is due to progressive dehydrogenation and deoxygenation
reactions as polycondensed aromatic structures are formed and
polyaromatization (i.e. growth in the size of the aromatic sheets)
becomes dominant (Nishimiya et al., 1998; Trompowsky et al.,
2005). Frchar produced at lower temperatures is heterogeneous,
containing higher proportions of oxygen, hydrogen, and disorganized carbon, evidently derived from incomplete thermal decomposition of lignocellulosic material (e.g. Baldock and Smernik,
2002; Ascough et al., 2008b). The extent of organized carbon
microcrystallites is smaller in Frchar produced at lower temperatures, presumably meaning a less well-developed aromatic structure exists in these samples.
Differences in the extent of organized carbon microcrystallite
domains and thermal stability are apparent between the two
analogue species, with less highly ordered carbon structures in pine
charcoal than in mangrove charcoal formed at the same temperature. These may relate to variations in the proportion of chemically
different components in the starting wood (e.g. Ascough et al.,
2008b), resulting in less complete thermal degradation and
aromatization of initial wood macromolecules in pine. This interpretation is supported by differences in the elemental composition
of the 300  C charcoal, where pine charcoal is closer to the
composition of the un-pyrolysed wood, containing a relatively high
proportion of oxygen and carbon.
The strong linear correlation between Romean and content of
carbon microcrystallites supports the interpretation that Romean is
a function of the amount of ordered, aromatic carbon in a sample,

which in turn is predominantly a function of temperature. Despite
the differences in species described above, the Romean values for
both species are within analytical uncertainty at equivalent
temperatures, suggesting that species-dependant chemical differences are insufﬁcient to result in a signiﬁcant Romean offset.
Ro-based temperatures calculated in this study are consistent
with previous work, where Romean values >2.0 were only observed
above 400  C, regardless of heating duration (Guo and Bustin, 1998;
McParland et al., 2009b). An important point is that after exposure
of biomass to temperatures much lower than 300  C, Romean is
likely to be extremely low and therefore increasingly difﬁcult to
quantify as cell wall outlines become increasingly difﬁcult to image
in reﬂected light. However, the clear relationship between Romean
and production temperature in the range tested here demonstrates
the power of the technique to accurately reconstruct production
temperatures for wood charcoal produced at 300–600  C, an
interpretation supported by other work in this ﬁeld (e.g. Hudspith
et al., 2010). It is also evident that in samples produced at 400  C,
Romean values are not altered by the K2Cr2O7 treatment, indicating
that the organized domains are not signiﬁcantly oxidized during
the treatment. This means that even following exposure to conditions of extreme degradation potential, reﬂectance measurements
appear to still be a robust measure of production temperature in
these samples. Therefore, where Romean measurements of environmental samples indicate production above 400  C, and the
sample appears structurally intact, the values of an assemblage as
a whole are less likely to have been inﬂuenced by diagenetic
processes. It is theoretically conceivable that such processes could
affect Romean if the result was a large-scale breakdown of charcoal
aromatic structure, reducing the size of polyaromatic domains
throughout the entire sample, but we have no evidence of this. As it
is not possible to use Romean measurements to assess potential
post-depositional alteration of charcoal assemblages, alternative
analytical methods are required to achieve this, as part of an integrated approach.
In the 300  C samples, where material does survive the K2Cr2O7
treatment, it appears not to have undergone major structural
alteration at the macroscopic to cellular level (Figs. 2 and 3). This
suggests that although a signiﬁcant proportion of the 300  C
charcoal is readily oxidizable, these charcoals also contain a resistant component. It is possible that this aromatic component is more
highly degradable as a result of the smaller microcrystallite extent
in low temperature Frchar, as atoms at the edge of polyaromatic
domains are more reactive than those within layer planes, meaning
that oxidation occurs preferentially at edge and defect sites (Walker
et al., 1959; Boehm et al., 1994). The mass loss during the K2Cr2O7
treatment in 300  C Frchar suggests that a signiﬁcant proportion of
the structure of low temperature charcoal is likely to be comprised
of a disorganized phase, which is quite readily susceptible to
oxidative degradation. If such degradation had the potential to alter
the measured Romean of low temperature charcoal, this could affect
interpretative accuracy based upon measurements of affected
material. However it should be stressed that the evidence does not
show that this is so. Until now reﬂectance measurements of charcoals giving temperatures between 300 and 400  C appear to give
consistent and reliable results (see below). However, the concept
that lower temperature charcoal samples are subject to greater
diagenetic degradation has implications that should be considered.
If a temperature is derived from Romean measurements of a suite of
charcoal particles that have been subject to signiﬁcant oxidation,
then a higher overall temperature may be inferred that is the actual
average for the particle group. This would be due to more rapid
degradation of the lower temperature charcoals, leaving only the
charcoals formed at higher temperatures. Therefore, it is important
that where Romean measurements indicate productions

P.L. Ascough et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 37 (2010) 1590–1599

temperatures <400  C, the potential for diagenetic alterations of
the sample be carefully assessed, for the reasons highlighted above.
If such alteration is suspected, the methodological approaches
employed in this study (e.g. elemental analysis) appear well suited
as diagnostic tools, as demonstrated from the environmental
charcoal samples.
4.2. Environmental charcoal: reconstruction of production
temperature and evidence for diagenetic alteration
It should be noted that, unlike the experimentally produced
charcoal where a charring time is known, in our environmental
charcoals this is not so. This means, therefore, that the interpreted
charring temperatures represent minimum charring temperatures
and only where the time may be indicated from the nature of the
deposit (e.g. in hot pyroclastic ﬂows, charcoal clamps) can an exact
temperature be calculated (see McParland et al., 2009b for
discussion).
Env-1 appears to be a high temperature (>500  C) charcoal that
has not been subject to alteration during deposition, as the sample
elemental composition, ordered carbon content, volatile content
and reactivity are all consistent with those of equivalent analogue
charcoal. Although Env-1 is of considerable antiquity (>50 Ka BP
(Alloway et al., 2004; Ascough et al., 2008a)), the conditions of burial
indicate slow soil formation processes and a lack of well-deﬁned soil
horizons (Alloway et al., 2004). It is possible that this resulted in
exposure of Env-1 to a low range of degradation processes,
contributing to the apparently pristine nature of this charcoal. The
characteristics of this sample support previous interpretations that
charcoal-derived black carbon can show extreme resistance to
environmental degradation over very extended time periods (e.g.
Liang et al., 2008).
In the case of Env-6, the Romean temperature assessments
(497  25  C) are consistent with pyrolysis efﬁciency estimated by
H/C ratio, content of organized carbon and reactivity. However, this
charcoal contains a larger amount of low thermal-stability volatile
material and higher oxygen content than that predicted from
analogue charcoal for this temperature. This suggests Env-6 may be
affected by diagenetic alteration resulting in the addition of oxygen
to the charcoal chemical structure. Previous observations suggest
that carboxylation processes play an important role in charcoal
diagenesis (e.g. Cohen-Ofri et al., 2006) and the addition of –COOH
groups would explain the increased oxygen content in Env-6.
However, all other analysis results support the results of Romean
measurements, suggesting that the processes affecting elemental
composition have not affected the accuracy of the Ro-based
temperature reconstruction for this sample.
The Romean data suggests Env-3 and Env-4 were produced at
361  24  C and 351  41  C, respectively. These samples have
similar atomic ratios and volatile content, and TGA data shows
higher reactivity in Env-4, which would be consistent with
production at a slightly lower temperature. All data are consistent
with results of analogue charcoal, apart from the atomic ratios. The
slightly higher than predicted O/C ratio indicates the possibility that
oxygen has been added to the charcoal structure. However, in these
samples the H/C ratios are also signiﬁcantly lower than predicted for
charcoal produced at w350  C. In this instance, diagenetic alteration
may have involved dehydrogenation reactions, resulting in the loss
of CH2 and CH3 groups from aliphatic molecules that were incompletely converted to aromatic compounds below 400  C. In the ﬁnal
two environmental samples, Env-2 and Env-5, Romean measurements again suggest production at <400  C. Both the oxygen and
hydrogen content of these samples is somewhat higher than that
predicted from equivalent analogue charcoal, again suggesting that
some diagenetic alteration has occurred. In such samples, it is

1597

important to consider the possibility that this material represents
the highly degraded remains of an initially more pristine charcoal
structure. However, the organized carbon content, reactivities, and
volatile content (34.10% and 41.13% of dry, ash-free sample weight) of
these charcoals are all comparable to that of the 300  C analogue
charcoal, supporting the reliability of the Romean temperature
assessments. An additional consideration is that in these samples the
non-aromatic component may represent incompletely converted,
and possibly diagenetically altered, lignocellulosic components of
the original plant material, or material derived from exogeneous
sources to the original plant, such as soil humic acids. In comparison
to charcoal, these materials contain a relatively high proportion of
oxygen and hydrogen, that may contribute to the observed O/C and
H/C ratios in Env-2 and Env-5.
4.3. Implications for archaeological and palaeoenvironmental
investigation
The concept of a continuum in degradation potential has
important implications for the use of charcoal within archaeological
research. For example, diagenetic processes can affect radiocarbon
dating accuracy; at the early human occupation site of Nauwalabila,
post-depositional alteration of some charcoal was so severe that
samples did not reliably reﬂect the sediment deposition date (Bird
et al., 2002). Additionally, loss or alteration of charcoal following
deposition may signiﬁcantly affect the accuracy of quantitative
estimates of ﬁre histories. The issue is greatly complicated by the
range in conditions of charcoal production that are likely to exist in
most instances, from settings such as domestic hearths to forest
wildﬁres. Here, a gradient in production temperature has the
potential to produce charcoal with different chemical characteristics that enters the depositional record at a single point in time. The
data also appear to indicate that deposition conditions play a key
role in charcoal alteration, as ancient samples such as Env-1 may
show less apparent alteration than younger samples exposed to
a different set of environmental conditions, but which were initially
exposed to a comparable temperature range (e.g. Env-6).
The results presented here highlight the value of integrating
Romean with other analytical methods in charcoal analysis when
assessing the likely diagenetic alteration of charcoal assemblages.
Useful approaches in this regard are elemental analysis, Raman
spectroscopy and TGA. These methods require small sample quantities (on the order of mg), are rapid and relatively low-cost. Pyrolysis
efﬁciency and the degree of charcoal oxidation is provided by H/C
and O/C ratio, respectively, while the extent of aromatic domains in
the charcoal, and its chemical resistance can be assessed via Raman
spectroscopy and TGA. In particular, it appears that addition of
oxygen to the charcoal chemical structure may occur during exposure to environmental conditions, as suggested previously (e.g.
Cohen-Ofri et al., 2006). Therefore an approach integrating these
methods allows assessment of the potential for post-depositional
alteration, particularly where charcoal samples may have been
produced at lower temperature. Where Romean measurements
suggest production under 400  C, this indicates that the charcoal
sample contains a variety of chemical compounds other than polyaromatic carbon. These could represent remains of incomplete
conversion of plant macromolecules, degradation of the charcoal
aromatic structure, or sources of exogenous contamination.
Important added value is provided from investigation integrating
several methodological approaches as a means of evaluating deliberate production of speciﬁc charcoal types. For example, it is interesting to note that although Env-3 and Env-4 were produced in
different locations, the charcoal is chemically very similar. This
suggests a consistency in production methodology and charcoal
quality between the two sites, and the possibility that this

1598

P.L. Ascough et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 37 (2010) 1590–1599

represented optimization of charcoal quality at a particular site with
regard for its intended purpose, an interpretation that is consistent
with archaeological data for this region (e.g. Church et al., 2007).

5. Conclusions
The present study further emphasises that mean random
reﬂectance under oil (Romean) of a charcoal sample is strongly positively correlated with the sample production temperature. As Romean
measurements are applicable for analysis of both ancient and
freshly-produced charcoal samples, the technique has important
beneﬁts for archaeological and palaeoenvironmental investigations,
as it provides quantitative information on ﬁre regime in both natural
(e.g. wildﬁre) and anthropogenic (e.g. domestic hearth) settings. In
this study we use an integrated methodological approach (i.e. Romean
coupled with elemental analysis, Raman spectroscopy and TGA) to
show that Romean is also strongly correlated with the extent of
organized, polyaromatic domains within charcoal. Along with reliable temperature reconstructions, Romean therefore also provides
information on the chemical structure of charcoal. This chemical
structure is clearly strongly dependant upon production temperature, and the results show that charcoal produced at lower
temperatures (e.g. 300  C) displays both higher reactivity and
chemical heterogeneity. As diagenetic processes can potentially alter
lower temperature (<400  C) charcoals, there may be a need to
assess the level of diagenetic alteration with other methods for
charcoal characterization. The results presented here highlight an
overall continuum in charcoal ‘degradability’ that is dependant upon
fuel material and production conditions. Diagenetic alteration and
loss of material appears more likely if initial charcoal production
temperatures were <400  C. This has importance for the use of
charcoal as an archaeological and palaeoenvironmental proxy data
source. For example, post-depositional loss of charcoal could affect
interpretations of ﬁre histories that are based upon variations in
charcoal abundance. The concept of diagenetic alteration also has
implications for wider applications, including the use of ‘biochar’
charcoal as a long-term carbon sequestration tool.
