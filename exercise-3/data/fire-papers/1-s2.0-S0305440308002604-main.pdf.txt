New excavations have been undertaken at Diepkloof Rock Shelter (DRS; South Africa) since 1999. It is one
of the very few sites where Howiesons Poort and Stillbay assemblages can be collected from the same
archaeological sequence. These Middle Stone Age techno-complexes are particularly interesting for their
afﬁnities with the much younger Later Stone Age facies, and their association with evidence for symbolic
behaviour. Establishing their chronology is therefore particularly important for the understanding of the
apparition and the evolution of the so-called ‘‘modern’’ behaviours. Data already available suggest ages
ranging from 55 to 80 ka for the Howiesons Poort and from 70 to 80 ka for the Stillbay techno-complexes
in several South African sites. The thermoluminescence dating undertaken at DRS on 22 stone samples
originating from the entire stratigraphic record indicates intervals starting 10–50 ka earlier for these
techno-complexes in this site. Possible caveats in the dating process are examined but to the best of our
current knowledge must be rejected.

1. Introduction
Howiesons Poort (HP) and Stillbay (SB), two techno-complexes
of the southern African Middle Stone Age (MSA), have drawn
a particular interest, since they are considered as possible evidence
for early modern behaviour. This comes ﬁrst from characteristics of
the lithic assemblages themselves (e.g. Thackeray, 1992): standardised forms, use of exotic material, blade and backing technologies, which are frequent in Later Stone Age (LSA) assemblages but
absent in the classical MSA preceding them. Moreover HP and SB
techno-complexes occur in several sites with artefacts suggesting
an early use of symbolism: engraved ochre at Blombos Cave and
Klein Kliphuis, shell beads at Blombos Cave and Sibudu (D’Errico
et al., 2008), incised ostrich eggshells at Diepkloof Rock Shelter

(Henshilwood et al., 2002, 2004; Mackay and Welz, 2008;
Parkington et al., 2005). Therefore, understanding these technocomplexes is particularly important for the research on modern
behavioural origins. While an important revision of their technological evolution was being undertaken (Minichillo, 2005; Porraz
et al., 2008; Rigaud et al., 2006; Soriano et al., 2007; Villa et al.,
2005; Wurz, 2000, 2002), geochronological studies involving
radiometric methods were performed during the last decade
(Feathers and Bush, 2000; Feathers, 2002; Grün and Beaumont,
2001; Jacobs, 2004; Jacobs et al., 2003a,b, 2006; Jones, 2001;
Piennar, 2005; Tribolo, 2003; Tribolo et al., 2005a,b; Valladas et al.,
2005; Vogel, 2000).
Stillbay assemblages are rare and, with the exception of Sibudu
Cave and Apollo 11, are all concentrated in the Cape Province
(Fig. 1a). Up to now, the only dates available for this technocomplex are those of Blombos Cave: a mean age of 74  5 ka was
obtained with the Thermoluminescence (TL) method on stones
(quartzites and silcretes) heated in ﬁreplaces (Tribolo et al., 2006).

They were in agreement with indirect dating results for the SB
facies in this site, obtained by Optically Stimulated Luminescence
applied to sediment and by Electron Spin Resonance applied to
teeth (Jacobs et al., 2006; Jones, 2001). Howiesons Poort assemblages are more widely spread in the southern part of the continent
(Fig. 1a). However, few are dated by radiometric methods. Ages at
Klasies River, Apollo 11, Rose Cottage, Border Cave and Sibudu fall
within a 55–65 ka interval (at one sigma). Two dates only at Border
Cave are older than 70 ka (Grün and Beaumont, 2001), and Millard
(2006), based on Bayesian analyses, estimates its beginning
between 82 and 68 ka (probability 95%) in that site. These dates
suggest that the SB is anterior to the HP techno-complex. Diepkloof
Rock Shelter, Sibudu and Apollo 11 (Vogelsang, oral communication) are the only known sites where this suggested sequence is
stratigraphically conﬁrmed (Rigaud et al., 2006) and where the SB/
HP succession can be newly documented.
Diepkloof Rock Shelter (DRS) is particularly rich in burnt
material, with a high content of charcoal and ashes. Burnt stones
are numerous and the site is therefore propitious to the application
of TL dating. A previous work on 5 burnt quartzites and silcretes
allowed the proposition of an interval of 55–65 ka for the top of the
HP levels (Tribolo, 2003; Tribolo et al., 2005a). We present here
new results obtained on 17 stone samples for both the entire HP
and top of SB levels.
2. Archaeological and geological context
2.1. Location and previous excavations
DRS (32 23014.700 S, 18 270 13.500 E) is located in the Sandveld,
a semi-arid region, about 150 km north of Cape Town (Fig. 1b). First

investigations at DRS and at the nearby site Diepkloof Kraal Shelter
took place in 1973 (Parkington and Poggenpoel, 1987). Excavations
were then pursued intermittently during the next three decades. In
1999, a collaboration project between the Department of Archaeology of the University of Cape Town and the Institute of Prehistory
and Quaternary Geology of the University of Bordeaux was set up and
ﬁeldwork in DRS has been since performed yearly and is still ongoing.
2.2. Morphological and geological context
The shelter opens to the east, 140 m above the Verlorenvlei
River, which reaches the Atlantic Ocean 18 km further to the northwest at Elands Bay village. About 25 m wide and 15 m deep, it is
eroded into the lower part of a residual quartzitic butte (Fig. SM1).
Deposits of MSA archaeological levels correspond to a single
sedimentary unit displaying a bedded lithofacies (Lenoble, 2005).
The latter is due to the stacking of sandy silt lenses of variable
thickness (1 to 10–15 cm), of small extent (generally <1 m), and
having a black (5 Y 2/1), white (10 YR 8/2), very dark grey (10 YR 3/
1), dark brown (7.5 YR 3/3), light yellowish brown (10 YR 6/4) or
reddish brown (5 YR 4/3 to 4/4) colour. Micromorphologic and Xray diffraction analyses show that the black colour is due to a high
content in charcoal, the white due to carbonated ashes, the grey
due to a mix of both. The brown lenses contain quartz grains mixed
with material of biologic origin submitted to micro-aggregation
and brunization. They turn yellow when enriched with phosphates.
At the base of the sequence, the SB and unidentiﬁed MSA levels
contain more sands and less microfragments of charcoal than the
overlying layers.
The sedimentary material is primarily the result of human
activities (lithic artefacts, bone fragments, charcoals, ashes) and

732

C. Tribolo et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 36 (2009) 730–739

non-human biogenic activities (organic particles, phytoliths, etc.),
but is also partly the result of diagenetic processes related to the
occurrence of guano (phosphates). The enclosing rock is responsible for some of the quartzitic material: plates and blocks of
quartzite scattered throughout the matrix (rock fall and spalling)
and quartz grains in the sediments (granular disintegration).
Sedimentary features (prograding organization of the layers,
erosive contacts, rills, small stone pavements, cross-bedded structures, etc.) indicate that part of these deposits correspond to a small
colluvial (runoff) cone related to a ﬂow coming from a karstic pipe
located at the rear of the rock shelter.
Gypsum and halite concretions are found to be scattered
throughout the entire deposits. They are randomly distributed,
regardless of the facies of the beds or of the morphological situation.
These salts were probably brought up to the site by air (sea fogs and/
or aeolian dust), and by water oozing the cracks and the pipes of the
enclosing rock (Lenoble, 2005). The presence of these salty
concretions, which are highly soluble, together with the excellent
preservation of the organic material (carbonised grass, leaves,
twigs), ashes lenses and structured ﬁreplaces suggests that the
runoffs were hortonian, which means that they were not associated
with important percolations and remained a surface phenomenon.
2.3. Archaeological sequence
The post 1999 digging has concerned two main areas: a 3  3 m2
quadrate on the O–Q/10–12 sector and 1  9 m2 trench from square
C6 to N6 (Fig. 2), with a focus on squares L–M6, where the deposit
was expected to be the thickest (Lenoble and Martinaud, 2003).
Currently ca. 370 cm of deposit has been dug there (315 cm only are
shown on Fig. 4), and the bedrock has not been reached yet. Figs. 3
and 4 present the stratigraphy of the highest sections in squares
P–Q9 and K–M6 respectively.
Considering the difﬁculties for excavating such complex bedded
lithofacies, every single lens of the deposit has been given
a temporary name (John, Mike, Kim, Larry, .; in alphabetical order

from top to bottom) in order to record, in addition to the three
dimensional coordinate system, the accurate stratigraphic origin of
artefact, anthropic features and samples. The coordinates of 24 000
artefacts (fauna and lithics >1.5 cm) have been recorded up to now.
On the basis of diagnostic artefacts, the archaeological deposits
have been schematically and temporally subdivided into 6 main
complexes (see Fig. SM2 for the correlations between the various
excavated areas).
The top of the sequence is composed of a shallow LSA level, with
an estimated radiocarbon age of <2 ka (Parkington and Poggenpoel, 1987): it has been entirely removed, but for a few pits, during
the 70s excavations. The remaining pits constitute complex 1. The
other complexes, from top to bottom are:
 Complex 2 – post-Howiesons Poort with unifacial points
(temporal entities ‘‘Claude’’ to ‘‘Danny’’).
 Complex 3 – Howiesons Poort with numerous backed pieces
and decorated ostrich eggshell (temporal entities ‘‘Debbie’’ to
‘‘Fiona’’ and Orange black complex 1 to Orange black complex 4).
 Complex 4 – Howiesons Poort with few backed pieces and no
decorated ostrich eggshell (temporal entities ‘‘Governor’’ to
‘‘Jack’’ including John and Orange black complex 5 – OB5). As
previously noticed, this is still a preliminary subdivision.
Ongoing technological studies help to clarify the attributes of
Complex 4 which documents a more complex SB/HP succession than reported elsewhere. Indeed, a high percentage of
ﬁne-grained raw materials, the dominance of denticulates and
notches and the absence of any other tool markers, typologically characterize the ‘Jeff’ lithic assemblage. Its technological
analyses (Porraz et al., 2008) show that the systematic
production of blades, the use of a soft-stone hammer with
tangential percussion, as well as a systematic selection of ﬁnegrained raw materials, are speciﬁc features of this lithic
assemblage. It appears to be the expression of behavioural
innovations which clearly predate the conventional Howiesons
Poort complex, as it is currently deﬁned.

the spot at Diepkloof. The size variability appears to be clearly
linked to the origin and the quality of the raw material. The
Stillbay points from Diepkloof can be easily compared to the
points from other assemblages as Hollow rock shelter or Dale
Rose Parlour (Texier et al., 2008, oral communication).

Ionizing radiation and luminescence are the two physical
phenomenon involved in thermoluminescence dating (Aitken,
1985). Indeed, rocks made of quartz grains and sediments naturally
contain radioisotopes, whose decay leads to the emission of energy
carried by alpha, beta and gamma rays. The energy absorbed by unit
of mass of sample and by unit of time (i.e. per year) constitutes the
dose rate to which the sample is submitted when buried. The dose
rate depends mainly on the radioisotope contents (Uranium,
Thorium and Potassium) of the rock sample itself and of its
surrounding sediment; it also includes a contribution from the
cosmic rays. At ﬁrst sight, the dose rate can be considered constant
at the MSA time scale.
The Luminescence phenomenon allows the determination of
the dose equivalent (De) to the total energy absorbed per unit of
mass by the sample during its burial. Indeed, once irradiated, and
when submitted to a heating, the quartz grains constituting the
burnt stone emit a light whose intensity is dependant of the dose
received since the last high temperature (e.g. 450  C) heating.
Moreover, this heating removes all the previously recorded doses.
Therefore, such heating in a prehistoric hearth of a stone has led to
the total resetting of its luminescence signal, which has grown up
again with burial time. The TL age, referring to the time of the last
heating event, is simply the ratio of the De to the dose rate.

 Complex 5 – Stillbay with bifacial points and ochre pencils
(temporary entities ‘‘Jess’’ to ‘‘Lynn’’, including Kerry and Kate,
Kim and Larry) (Fig. 4 and Fig. SM3) The DRS Stillbay complex has
been excavated on 3 m2 until now. Several layers have given
a total of 35 fragmentary or whole Stillbay points shaped from 3
different raw materials (two local and one imported raw material). A preliminary analysis of the lithic assemblages already
well documented by rough out as well as characteristic bifacial
shaping ﬂakes and several broken points showing knapping
accidents indicates that most of the points have been shaped on

More than ﬁfty stone samples have been brought to the laboratory and been tested for their potential for luminescence dating.
For each, the natural TL signal was compared to TL signals obtained
after additional artiﬁcial irradiations. The samples are datable when
the TL signal is not saturated (i.e. signiﬁcant growth with the added
dose) and when the shapes of the glow curves (TL in function of
temperature) are not changing with heat treatments (i.e. a heating
up to 500  C at 5  C/s for the test). Seventeen samples have thus
been selected. Seven of them originate from the OB5 unit in squares
O11, P11 and O12 and are associated with the HP complex (sample
nos.: DRS 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25) (Fig. SM4). DRS 112, 132 and 133
were discovered in layer ‘‘John’’, square M6 and are also associated
with the HP levels. Stratigraphic relationships suggest OB5 and
John might be contemporaneous. The other samples all come from
squares L6 and M6. DRS 115 and 117 were found in layers «Kerry–
Kate» while DRS 30, 33, 38, 126 and 131 come from layers «Kim» or
«Larry», all being attributed to the SB techno-complex.
All these samples are quartzites, weighing between 26 and
264 g. For all of them, thin sections were prepared. Optical
microscopy indicates very few minerals (undetermined heavy
minerals, amphiboles) other than quartz.

3.3.1. Sample preparation
The external layer (2 mm) of the sample that was exposed to
alpha and beta radiations from the sediment was removed by
sawing in order to simplify the dose rate estimate. Moreover, this

procedure discards the part of the sample exposed to light during
discovery, whose TL can be partly bleached (Tribolo et al., 2003).
The core (ca. 2 g) was then crushed to a grain size less than 160 mm.
The 100–160 mm fraction was then selected by sieving, cleaned
with hydrochloric acid (but no chemical reaction was observed,
conﬁrming the absence of carbonates), and rinsed with water,
ethanol and acetone.

3.3.2. Apparatus for TL measurements
The TL measurements were performed with a homemade TL
apparatus (Valladas et al., 1994). Its large heating plate allows the
measurement of ca. 10 mg aliquots. The detection system was
composed of a blue ﬁlter (MTO 380 nm), and of an EMI 9635
photomultiplier tube. Artiﬁcial irradiations were performed with
a Cs-137 gamma source, delivering 0.02 Gy/s.

C. Tribolo et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 36 (2009) 730–739

variation of this ratio reaches a minimum (i.e. when the two curves
become homothetic). The calculation was performed for the
temperature interval (usually from 340 to 410  C) where the De is
constant (De plateau) (Fig. 5a).
The resulting De covers a large range of values, from 52.8  2.5
to 180.2  8 Gy (Table 1).

3.4. Determination of the dose rate
For each sample, the dose rate includes an internal component,
mainly due to the alpha and beta rays emitted by the radioisotopes
present in the artefact and whose ranges in siliceous materials are
short (ca. 20 mm and 2 mm respectively)1. The dose rate received by
the core of our samples has also an external component, due to
gamma rays coming from the surrounding of the stone sample
(maximum range ca. 40 cm) and cosmic rays (Aitken, 1985).

dose axis are also indicated (grey diamonds).

3.3.3. Characteristics of the TL signal
For all samples but DRS 30, the natural TL glow curve presents
two distinct peaks whose relative intensity varies from one sample
to another (Fig. 5a). One is centred on 270  C, which is not stable for
the considered time scale (>10 ka; Spooner and Quiestaux, 2000).
The second peak is centred on 375  C, and, because of its stability,
has been used for the determination of the De. DRS 33 is the only
sample to present only one peak, centred on 320  C and which is
also theoretically stable at the scale of hundred thousands years.
After irradiation, several other unstable peaks appear at
temperatures below 260  C. They are eliminated before each TL
measurement by a cut-heat at 230  C.
3.3.4. Methodology
Two growth curves were built up: the additive growth curve,
obtained when artiﬁcial doses were added to the natural one, and
the regenerative growth curve, obtained when the artiﬁcial irradiation followed a full resetting of the TL signal by heating (350  C
during 90 min). Four doses and four aliquots per dose were used to
build each growth curve (Fig. 5b). The obtained TL versus dose
points was interpolated either with a quadratic or with an exponential function. Then a slide method was used to calculate the De
(Mercier et al., 1992). It consists in sliding the additive curve along
the dose axis and calculating the ratio between the slid additive and
regenerative curves for different doses: the De is obtained when the

3.4.1. Internal dose rate
The internal dose rate depends primarily on the content in
Uranium, Thorium and Potassium of the material extracted. 200 mg
of the 0–160 mm fraction powder obtained by crushing has thus
been analysed for each sample by neutron activation. The contents
are highly variable, from 0.39  0.01 to 2.85  0.06 ppm for U,
2.23  0.04 to 9.52  0.20 ppm for Th and 0.0304  0.0023 to
0.6771  0.0078% for K (Table 2).
The dose rate also depends on the size of the quartz grains from
which the TL signals originate and on the distance between the
emitters. To get an estimation of this last parameter, ﬁssion track
analyses have been performed on 6 quartzites and 1 silcrete from
the top of the sequence (Tribolo, 2003). Evaluating more accurately
the distribution of Uranium inside these samples was thus possible:
as expected, this radioisotope is located in the contact between the
quartz grains, and in the few minerals other than quartz which are
observable in thin sections. It was assumed that the distribution
was the same for Th and K. For the sake of simplicity, the effect of
concentration in non-quartz minerals has been neglected and it
was assumed that the radioactive emitters were homogeneously
distributed outside the quartz grains. As the dose rate depends on
the size of the quartz grains (the larger the grain, the higher the
beta and alpha attenuation, and the lower the dose rate), the
granulometric diagram was determined for each dated quartzite
following Tribolo et al. (2006): volumetric frequencies of grain sizes
were determined by image analysis of the thin sections observed
with an optical microscope (Fig. SM5 and Table SM1) and were
combined with Mejdahl’s (1979) and Brennan et al.’s (1991)
attenuation factors.
For the estimation of the alpha dose rate, it is also important to
bear in mind the fact that alpha rays do not have the same efﬁciency as beta rays for inducing luminescence. The sensitivity factor
(S-alpha2) has been determined for 12 out of 17 samples, following
the methods described by Valladas and Valladas (1982) and Tribolo
et al. (2001) (Table 2). For eleven samples, the S-alpha shows little

Actually, a small contribution from the gamma produced by the radioisotopes
present within the stone is also taken into account (Valladas, 1985).

S-a ¼ ðLa  DbÞ=ðFa  LbÞ, where La and Lb are the luminescence intensities
induced by the artiﬁcial alpha integrated ﬂux fa (number of a/cm2) and the artiﬁcial beta dose Db (Gy), respectively. The equivalent beta dose rate Daequ.b to be
considered in the age equation is the product of the S-alpha value and the alpha
ﬂux rate, which depends on the speciﬁc U and Th alpha ﬂuxes (19 400 and 5377
respectively; Valladas, 1988) and on the radioisotopic contents of the sample. Thus,
S-alpha can also be expressed to a ﬁrst approximation as:

S-a ¼ k

½UdsU þ ½ThdsTh
½UfsU þ ½ThfsTh

where k is the usual k-value (Zimmerman, 1971) and dsU and dsTh are the speciﬁc
alpha doses for U and Th, respectively.

Table 1
Equivalent doses, dose rates and age data. The external gamma dose rates take into account the mean of the doses obtained for the associated dosimeters (see Fig. SM 5). A correction for the attenuation due to the stone sample itself
has been applied (Valladas, 1985). The current water content is considered representative of the past and no further correction was applied. The correction of the alpha dose rate accounts for the difference between beta and alpha
sensitivity. The cosmic dose rate is 0.02  0.01 Gy/ka for all samples and is included in the total external dose rate. The error associated to the dose rates is statistic, but for the external gamma dose where the standard deviation of the
doses for the associated dosimeter has been used. For the external gamma dose rate, a systematic error of 10% has been added quadratically for the ﬁnal calculations, taking into account the uncertainty for the calibrated source and
the uncertainty on the temporal stability of the dose rate. For the internal dose rate, a 10% systematic error is also used for the estimation of the U, Th and K content and 2% for the alpha sensitivity. For the equivalent dose, the
uncertainty in the table is statistic and a 1.5% systematic error has been used. The uncertainty on the age (one sigma) is the quadratic sum of the statistic and systematic error.

variation (relative standard deviation of 6% only) and the mean
value (6.2  0.4 mGy/1000 alpha/cm2) has thus been used for the
ﬁve samples left unmeasured. DRS 33 has a slightly higher S-alpha
value (8.49  0.97 mGy/1000 alpha/cm2).
3.4.2. External dose rate
The cosmic dose rate has been deduced from the estimated
thickness of the roof (25 m), and calculated after Prescott and
Hutton (1994). The contribution of cosmic rays passing through the
opening of the shelter was assumed to be negligible. The cosmic
dose rate is then 0.02  0.01 Gy/ka.
In order to determine the gamma dose rate, 27 CaSO4 dosimeters were inserted in the available sections and were left for ca. one
year. The deduced gamma dose rates are presented on Fig. SM5. The
high variability at the top of squares O–Q 11 and O10 (0.49–0.90 Gy/
ka), which appeared problematic for the preceding TL dating work
(Tribolo, 2003), seems to decrease in the lower levels in square P11
and in square M6 (8 values between 0.49 and 0.57 Gy/ka for
Z > 200 cm). These dose rates take into account the water content
of the sediment during the burial time of the dosimeters. We
believe however that the current water content is not signiﬁcantly
different from the past mean one. Indeed, as expressed earlier, the
exceptional preservation of the organic materials (seeds, plants.),
and the presence of salt crystals (gypsum and halite) which are
highly soluble, both suggest that the core of the sediment has
remained nearly dry, as it is the case nowadays; the runoff that
eventually reworked the surface sediments during their accumulation was not followed by important percolations.
This assumption also suggests that the 238U decay chain, which
contains several soluble radioisotopes (238U, 234U and 226Ra), was
not disturbed by water ﬂows during burial time. High resolution
gamma spectrometry was performed on 13 sediment samples
distributed all along the stratigraphy in order to observe the state of
equilibrium of the U decay chain and estimate the respective
contribution of U, Th and K in the gamma dose rate (Table 3).
Disequilibrium is actually observed for the U decay chain but
there is no clear correlation between the stratigraphic position of
the sample and the state of disequilibrium. The analyses also show
that the Uranium from the sediment contributes to ca. 22% of the
external gamma dose rate and subsequently to only 7–17% to
the total dose rate. The eventual evolutions of the dose rate due to
the disequilibrium in the U decay chain will therefore be of minor
impact regarding the age estimation. The disequilibrium might

For the gamma spectrometry measurements no radon escape is allowed and
Pb and 214Bi, the main responsible for the gamma dose, are in equilibrium with
Ra. However in the sediment, if there was some radon escape or capture, one can
assume that an equilibrium was reached in a given volume between the resultant
222
Rn activity and the rest of the chain, i.e. 214Pb, 214Bi and 210Pb. Thus, the 210Pb
activity measured would reﬂect this state and the gamma dose due to the 214Pb and
214
Bi decay should be deduced from it, rather than from their measured activities.

In a previous study, an inﬁnite radiocarbon age (GifA 102381,
55 ka) was obtained on plant fragments for the unit ‘‘Buddy–
Becky’’, above the HP, and 5 TL dates were obtained for the OB1–4
units (Tribolo, 2003). These ﬁrst results displayed some scatter
attributed to the high variability of the gamma dose rate in the area
where the samples came from. However, after taking into account
the spatial variability of the gamma dose rate, it was concluded that
the most likely time interval for OB1–4 was 55–65 ka.
The ages obtained in this study for unit OB5 and below are
presented on Table 1. They range between 60  6 ka and 87  14 for
OB5, 72  7 ka and 96  10 for John, both associated with HP artefacts. For the layers associated with SB artefacts ages range from
99  10 to 118  11 ka (Kerry–Kate) and 108  9 to 129  11 ka
(Kim–Larry).
Radiometric dates for the HP techno-complex fall within a 55–
65 ka interval at Klasies River, Rose Cottage, Boomplaas and Apollo
11 (Feathers, 2002; Grün et al., 1990b; Miller and Beaumont, 1989;
Miller et al., 1999; Tribolo et al., 2005a,b; Valladas et al., 2005;
Vogel, 2000) and are thus consistent with the results previously
obtained for the OB1–4 unit. The ages for OB5 and John units are
unusually large, but they are consistent at one or two sigma with
the oldest estimates for the HP at Border Cave (74  4 and
76  4 ka; Grün et al., 1990a; Grün and Beaumont, 2001).

3.4.3. Total dose rate
As it could be expected from the De variability, the total dose
rates are also highly variable (Table 1), from 0.691  0.021 to
1.608  0.031 Gy/ka (statistical uncertainties). The internal dose
rate contributes for 24–67% of the total dose. Note that the higher
the contribution of the internal dose rate to the total dose, the
lower the impact on the ﬁnal age of any variation in the external
dose rate.

have several origins and hypotheses can be proposed: in 7 out of 13
cases, the 226Ra activities are up to 39% lower than the 234Th
activities (Table 3). In order to conciliate the observations of the
234
Th/226Ra disequilibrium with the observation of the weakness of
percolating water, it must be assumed that the disequilibrium was
present from the time of deposition, with 226Ra supported by 230Th
(i.e. 238U and 234U in excess compare to 230Th and 226Ra). In that
case, the long half-life of 238U would have prevented any signiﬁcant
evolution of the 230Th and 226Ra activities over the last 100 ka.
Alpha spectrometry will be used in a future work in order to test
this hypothesis.
One can also observe that the end of the U decay chain is out of
equilibrium for some samples: in 5 of 13 cases, the 210Pb activities
are up to 59% higher or 22% lower than the 226Ra activities. This
could be imputed to radon escape or capture. While this hypothesis
remains to be tested, it must be noticed that the U-gamma dose rate
calculated from the 210Pb activities is only up to 12% higher than the
U-gamma dose rate calculated from the 226Ra activities3. Again,
the impact on the total dose rate is minor since the Uranium of the
sediment only contributes from 7 to 17% to the total dose rate.
Therefore, the current gamma dose calculated from the dosimeter
measurements has been used for the calculation of the age.

Table 3
Results for the analysis of sediments by high-resolution gamma spectrometry. Activities (in Bq/kg) are indicated for the U and Th decay chain, while for K, the content is given in %. The gamma dose rate for U is calculated with the
238
U activities for the head of the U chain, and 226Ra activities for the end of it. Total U-gamma dose rate includes the contribution from the 235U family. The last three columns give the relative percentage of U, Th and K contribution to
the gamma dose rate.

The ages for the SB however are much larger than those obtained at
Blombos Cave for the same kind of sample (TL: 74  5 ka – Tribolo
et al., 2006, in agreement with the OSL results on sediment – Jacobs
et al., 2003a,b, 2006 – and ESR on teeth – Jones, 2001), which is the
only site for which a SB age is currently published. As previously
mentioned, the analysis of the bifacial foliate points shows that
they are not technologically different from those of other SB
assemblages, which could have explained the apparent difference
in age. Possible methodological caveats that could lead to ages
erroneously high are further examined.
In order to get our SB ages about 75 ka, i.e. similar to those
obtained at Blombos Cave, the De should be up to 60% lower. The
estimated De could be erroneously high if the past heating had
been too low, i.e. the TL signal has not been fully reset before burial.
This should theoretically be apparent when plotting the De in
function of the temperature: the function should be growing
(plateau test). However, this behaviour has not been observed for
any of the samples.
The main caveat in the determination of the internal dose rate is
the modelling of the distribution of the radioisotopes. We have
assumed that the radioisotopes were homogeneously distributed
outside the quartz grains. If the distribution was not homogeneous,
the internal dose rates would be lower than those calculated, and
consequently, the ages higher. On the contrary, so as to get a higher
internal dose rate, a signiﬁcant part of the radioisotopes should be
contained inside the quartz grains, which is opposed to the usual
observations (Aitken, 1985) and to those performed with the ﬁssion
tracks method on quartzites from the top of the sequence.
It is possible that the thickness of the roof above the site has
been overestimated, or that the contribution of the cosmic rays
directly entering into the shelter is not insigniﬁcant, contrarily to
our assumption. If so, however, the underestimation of the cosmic
dose would be <0.2 Gy/ka, which would be too low to explain the
age difference between our results and those already published:
most of the dose rates for the SB samples should be at least 0.47 Gy/
ka higher if the ages were around 75 ka.
We have argued that the current water content was representative of the past mean one. Supposing that the water content was
high (e.g. 15%) during the dosimeter burial and was zero during the
burial time of the quartzite samples, the difference in the dose rate
for the dosimeters in M6 would be between 0.07 and 0.10 Gy/ka
only, well below the 0.47 Gy/ka needed.
The last possibility would be an important and recent departure
of some radioisotopes. However, as discussed above, while the
activity of 226Ra is low, its departure could be only through major
percolations, which is unlikely according to the observations (in
particular the preservation of fragile organic carbonised remains
and soluble salt crystals). Neither would the escape of 222Rn have
an impact strong enough on the gamma dose rate to explain an
underestimation of the dose rate. As to K input by guano, as
observed in Hayonim (Mercier et al., 2006), it would have the
opposite effect on the age estimates.
As a conclusion, we ﬁnd no valid argument that would support
the hypothesis of an overestimate in our results. While further
methodological studies are planed to conﬁrm these results, one can
already emphasis that 1) the ages for a given level are in general
agreement (Chi-square test validated) despite the strong variability
of the internal dose rates and equivalent doses, and 2) they are
stratigraphically consistent. They are reported on Fig. 6, together
with the ages obtained in the previous TL study of the OB1–4 units
(Tribolo, 2003).
A Bayesian analysis, using Oxcal 4.0 software (Bronk Ramsey,
1995, 2001) and following Rhodes et al. (2003) recommendations,
was performed with our TL results to calculate the most likely
intervals for each level. The boundaries of these intervals are
(at 68% conﬁdence): 61  4 ka (OB1–4/OB5–John), 93  8 ka

(OB5–John /Kerry–Kate), 113  8 ka (Kerry–Kate/Kim–Larry) and
128  10 ka (Kim–Larry/underneath). After these results, the SB
was in place at DRS during Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 5, while in
Blombos and Sibudu, it appeared during MIS 4 only (Wadley, 2007).
Our current best estimate for the switch from SB to HP at DRS is
93  8 ka. This is consistent with the Bayesian analysis performed
by Millard (2006), who suggested that the HP started at Blombos
cave as early as 82 ka (95% conﬁdence).
5. Conclusion
Until recently, the Stillbay techno-complex was radiometrically
dated at Blombos Cave only and was believed to be restricted to the
Southern Western Cape (e.g. Henshilwood et al., 2001). The
discovery of a Stillbay assemblage at Sibudu, 800 km east from this
area, has already contributed to change our view on its spatial
distribution (Wadley, 2007). The discovery of another rich Stillbay
assemblage at DRS now allows us to propose that we should
eventually also change our view on its chronology. Indeed, while
the stratigraphy conﬁrms its anteriority to the Howiesons Poort, the
TL dating of 22 stones samples, for which no major failure could be
found, suggests that the SB started much earlier than previously
assumed. Further geochronological and technological studies are
planed at Diepkloof to conﬁrm these results and try understanding
why, if need be, HP and SB could have appeared earlier in some sites
than in others.
