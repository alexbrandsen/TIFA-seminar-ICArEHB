ABSTRACT

Recently, Alcántara Garcı́a et al. (in press) presented a new method and criteria for
distinguishing between fractures imparted by hominid hammerstone percussion and carnivores chewing on ‘green’ limb bones of ungulates. The method uses a combination of fracture
plane and fracture angle data that are useful for elucidating the relative role of hominids in the
accumulation of prehistoric archaeofaunas, especially when employed in concert with other
classes of taphonomic data. We briefly summarise the method and apply it to the ungulate
limb bone subassemblage from Swartkrans Member 3, a c. 1.0 million year old site from South
Africa that preserves Early Stone Age lithic artefacts, hominid fossils, and an abundant
mammalian fauna with cutmarked, hammerstone-percussed and burned bone specimens.
Results of the fracture pattern analysis corroborate indications from other lines of taphonomic
data that there was minimal carnivore–hominid interdependence in the formation of the fauna,
and that carnivores were probably responsible for the majority of the bone collection in
Member 3. However, we also document a significant hominid influence on assemblage
formation, a finding that expands and refines our understanding of large animal carcass
foraging by hominids in southern Africa during the early Pleistocene. Copyright  2004 John

fracture patterns has often featured in zooarchaeological studies of Pliocene and Pleistocene
assemblages from both the Old and New Worlds
(e.g. Pei, 1938; Dart, 1957; Sadek-Kooros, 1972,
1975; Bonnichsen, 1973, 1975, 1979; Irving &

Patou Mathis, 1993; Pérez Ripoll, 1993; Rueda,
1993; Anconetani et al., 1996; Mateos Cachorro
1999, 2000).1 Prominent among this body of
work is Villa & Mahieu’s (1991) study of limb
bone fracture in anatomically modern human
skeletons from French archaeological sites,
research that corroborated and expanded that
of earlier workers (e.g. Myers et al., 1980;
Johnson, 1985) and anticipated that of others
(e.g. Martı́nez, 1998; Outram, 2001). Villa &
Mahieu (1991) concentrated on five limb bone
fracture attributes: fracture outline (the shape of
the fracture); proportion of original shaft circumference remaining; shaft fragmentation; shaft
breadth to length ratios; and, most relevant to
the present study, fracture angle (i.e. that ‘angle
formed by the fracture surface and the bone
cortical surface’; Villa & Mahieu, 1991: 34).
Importantly, fracture angles of limb bones that
are broken when ‘green’ (i.e. before significant
loss of a bone’s organic fraction and its desiccation) are usually either acute or obtuse. This is in
contrast to limb bones that are broken when dry,
which usually preserve fracture angles that are
right. Capaldo & Blumenschine (1994: 763) supplemented this work by investigating variability
in fracture angles imparted on green bone by
different taphonomic agents, finding that angles
on bone fragments ‘removed from percussion
notches are more obtuse than those removed
from carnivore notches, which are closer to
perpendicular’.
Another way in which zooarchaeologists have
considered fracture patterns relevant to the current study regards planes of fracture. Conventionally, it is agreed that with reference to its long
axis, any broken limb bone fragment can possess
one or more the following fracture planes: longitudinal, transverse and oblique (e.g. SadekKooros, 1972, 1975; Shipman et al., 1981;
Bridault, 1984; Patou Mathis, 1984; Johnson,
1985a; Todd, 1987; Alcalá & Martin, 1988;
1
Limb bones as defined here include the ungulate humerus, radioulna, metacarpal, femur, tibia and metatarsal, even though the
metacarpals and metatarsals are technically bones of the foot.
However, we group the metapodials with actual limb bones because
they are anatomically and functionally similar to limbs in most
ungulates. Further, we make this decision to avoid the often-used
but vague term ‘long bone’ that, in many systems, includes such nonrelevant elements as proximal phalanges (see also Pickering et al.,
2003).

Note that a curved (helical) obliquely oriented fracture is illustrated,
but that such fractures can also be straight.

Morales, 1988; Gifford-Gonzalez, 1989; Marshall,
1989; Anconetani, 1996) (Figure 1). GiffordGonzalez (1989) provided clear definitions of
fractures that are longitudinal (fractures parallel
to the long axis of the bone) and transverse
(fractures at right angles to the long axis of the
bone). In contrast, an oblique fracture departs
from the long axis of the bone at a <90 ,
subparallel angle, and can either be straight or
curved in a helical pattern (as illustrated in
Figure 1). Analytical consideration of the ways
in which these planes are combined in archaeofaunas has been used previously in attempts to
elucidate fracture patterns at the assemblage level
(e.g. Sadek-Kooros, 1975; Shipman et al., 1981).
Surprisingly, in the fallout of all this abundant
and important research was a sobering perception
Int. J. Osteoarchaeol. 15: 247–260 (2005)

Limb Bone Fracture at Swartkrans
that specific fracture types within these (and
other) systems are highly subject to equifinality
on at least one important level (e.g. Dart, 1957;
Zierhut, 1967; Sadek-Kooros, 1972, 1975; NoeNygaard, 1977; Bonnichsen, 1979; Shipman &
Phillips, 1976, 1981; Haynes, 1980, 1983, 1988;
Myers et al., 1980; Binford, 1981; Lyman, 1989,
1994; Johnson, 1985a; Badam et al., 1986; Gibert
et al., 1992, 1993; Charles, 1998; Marean et al.,
2000). For example, although Villa & Mahieu’s
(1991) system of fracture angle analysis does
reliably inform about the condition of bones
when originally fractured (i.e. whether they
were green or dry), it is still unable alone to inform
about the agent(s) of those fracturing events.
Because of this ambiguity in linking fracture
form with specific taphonomic agents (e.g.
hominids versus carnivores) and effectors (e.g.
hammerstones versus teeth), fracture pattern data
are still largely under-utilised by zooarchaeologists interested in reconstructing early hominid
behaviour.
Fortunately, however, Capaldo & Blumenschine’s
(1994) seminal study demonstrated the merit of a
refined consideration of fracture angles for reliably distinguishing breakage caused by the
dynamic impact of a hominid-wielded hammerstone from that caused by the static loading of
carnivore teeth. Alcántara Garcı́a et al. (in press)
have expanded usefully on this earlier research by
Capaldo & Blumenschine (1994). Here we
explain briefly the system introduced by
Alcántara Garcı́a et al. (in press), summarise its
experimental results, and then apply them to the
ungulate limb bone component of the c. 1.0
million year old (Ma) archaeofauna from
Swartkrans Member 3. This exercise illustrates
the utility of this novel analytical method by
providing new information about the carcass
foraging behaviour of early hominid and carnivore bone accumulators at Swartkrans.

Materials and methods

The fossil sample and general methodology
The Swartkrans Member 3 faunal assemblage
(excavated 1979–1986) was analysed originally
by Brain (1993a; Brain et al., 1988), Watson

249
(1993) and Newman (1993). Member 3 is estimated to be c. 1.0 Ma (Brain, 1993b) and preserves fairly abundant remains of Australopithecus
robustus in addition to fossils of many other
mammalian taxa (Brain et al., 1988; Grine,
1988, 1989, 1993; Watson, 1993). In total, the
Member 3 assemblage consists of 108,098 bone
specimens (Watson, 1993). Of that total, we reanalysed 1466 specimens. This sample includes
the complete ungulate limb bone shaft subassemblage  5 cm in maximum dimension,
regardless of preserved bone surface modifications on those specimens. In addition, those
limb bone shaft specimens <5 cm in maximum
dimension with observed prehistoric bone surface damage were also included in our analysed
sample. We collected data on numerous taphonomic attributes that are detailed elsewhere
(Pickering et al., 2004a,b, 2005), but included
for each specimen an assessment of skeletal
element, bone portion, subaerial weathering
stage, overall cortical condition, maximum
dimensions and bone surface modifications
(e.g. carnivore tooth marks, rodent gnaw marks,
insect damage, ‘random’ linear striae and stone
tool cutmarks and percussion marks). Following the recommendations of several experts
(e.g. Bunn, 1982, 1991; Bunn & Kroll, 1986;
Blumenschine & Selvaggio, 1988, 1991;
Blumenschine, 1995; Blumenschine et al., 1996),
bone surfaces were examined with the aid of
a strong low-incidence light and at least
10 magnification. Attribution of bone surface
damage was corroborated in a sample of specimens with scanning electron microscopy.

Application of new system of bone
fracture analysis
Using the system of Alcántara Garcı́a et al. (in
press), we also collected data on the condition of
all pre-fossilisation, green fracture planes in the
Swartkrans subassemblage of limb bone shaft
specimens. A fracture plane is considered green
if it possesses a smooth release surface and its
measured angle is <85 or >95 (see discussion
below, and that of Villa & Mahieu, 1991). Following these criteria, 903 individual fracture planes

Notes: Alca¤ntara Garcı́a et al. (in press) should be consulted for full experimental details. In summary,124 shaft specimens were created by
hammerstone percussion (dynamic loading) from a starting total of14 whole limb bones (three humeri, one radius, five femora and five tibiae). Bones were struck with the unmodified surfaces of four hammerstones, which ranged in diameter from 8^14 cm and in weight from
556^1164 gm.In each case, a defleshedbone still retainingitsperiosteum was rested onananvilpositioned directlybelow the intendedpoint
of impact (cf. Bunn,1989). However, because novice (student) bone-breakers were used in the study, impact points varied between bones
with respect to the aspect (medial, lateral, ventral or dorsal) on which force was directed and along the length of each. Next, 48 shaft specimens were created by pressure (static loading) from a starting total of11whole limb bones (two humeri, one radius, five femora and three tibiae). Most of these shaft fragments resulted from the chewing activities of a large domestic dog and spotted hyenas on nine of the limb
bones.However, in order to increase sample size, another two bones were broken by humans using pliers; this effectively simulated the static loading of carnivore chewing (see also Capaldo & Blumenschine,1994). Fractures imparted by dynamic and static loading on metapodials were not separable into exclusive groups (probably due to the greater thickness of metapodials relative to upper and intermediate
limb bones), and thus were not considered systematically in the study of Alca¤ntara Garcı́a et al. (in press). Data are summarised for each
fracture plane (longitudinal, transverse and oblique) and by animal body size. Using the well-known classification scheme of Brain (1981),
sheep fall into size classes 1 and 2 (small animals), while cows are size class 3 (large animals). Data include means, standard deviations
(S.D.) and 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) using a t distribution in which t 0.025 is the critical value with n ¼1degrees of freedom.

limb bone shaft subassemblage were used in this
analysis. Because the system of Alcántara Garcı́a
et al. (in press) is new to zooarchaeology we
outline it here, as well as presenting a summary
of their pertinent experimental results (Table 1).
We first classified each green fracture plane as
longitudinal, transverse or oblique. As Bunn
(1982, 1989) has observed and commented, it is
sometimes difficult to define boundaries between
the end of one fracture plane and the beginning
of another on a single bone specimen. Biddick &
Tomenchuck (1975) and Davis (1985) have proposed analytical systems that might circumvent
the problem highlighted by Bunn, but these
systems are cumbersome and extremely timeCopyright # 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

consuming (see discussions in Villa & Mahieu,
1991; Outram, 2001). Some of the limb bone
shaft specimens in the Swartkrans Member 3
sample could be described as ovate or possess
some other ‘irregular’ form. However, after our
extensive experience with the assemblage, we are
comfortable stating that the majority of specimens are less ambiguously classified. On this
latter type of specimen, inter-plane boundaries
were fairly straightforward to set, and we found a
high degree of agreement among our research
group for assigning those boundaries (Figure 2). If
there was no agreement, then the specimen was
not included in our sample. Next, we used a
goniometer to measure the angle of each

accepted fracture plane at the midpoint of the
plane (see also Capaldo & Blumenschine, 1994).
Midpoint measurements were the chosen standard because the fracture angle of a plane often
varies along its full length. Each fracture plane
was measured at least twice and measurements
were recorded to the nearest whole degree.
Based on the combined analysis of preserved
fracture planes and fracture angles (as defined by
Villa & Mahieu, 1991; see above), Alcántara
Garcı́a et al. (in press) documented statistically
significant differences between a sample of 124
green sheep and cow limb bone specimens (263
fracture planes) broken by modern human subjects using stone hammers (percussion or
dynamic impact) and 48 (94 fracture planes)
fractured by the chewing of a large domestic
dog and wild spotted hyenas (pressure or static
loading). The legend to Table 1 contains pertinent information on the experimental protocol of
Copyright # 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Alcántara Gracı́a et al. (in press), but readers are
encouraged to consult the original publication for
more details.
In general, a green bone will fracture, relative
to its long axis, along oblique and/or longitudinal
planes, and will preserve fracture angles that vary
but are usually <85 or >95 . This is in contrast
to a dry broken bone, which will typically break
along transverse and/or longitudinal planes at a
90 angle and with an irregular release surface
(see also Villa & Mahieu, 1991). More specifically, within Alcántara Garcı́a et al.’s (in press)
sample of green bone broken by human hammering and carnivore chewing, there is notable overlap in the range of angles imparted by each
activity along longitudinal fracture planes. An
exception is the occurrence of acute angles on
fragments from the larger cow bones (size class 3;
for size class definitions, see Brain, 1981). In
addition, there is also much overlap in the angles
Int. J. Osteoarchaeol. 15: 247–260 (2005)

T. R. Pickering et al.

252
of transverse fractures imparted by humans and
carnivores, especially on bone specimens from
large animals and with angles >90 .
In contrast to longitudinal and transverse fractures, there is much less overlap in the angles of
oblique fractures imparted by humans and carnivores. Fortunately, oblique fractures are also the
most common fracture type imparted by both
agents of fracture. Finally, it appears that transverse fractures are less informative than longitudinal and oblique fractures for two reasons:
they occur much less often than do longitudinal
and oblique fractures, and this smaller sample
size means that the range of variation of angles
along transverse planes is wider and with more
overlap.
The results of Alcántara Garcı́a et al. (in press)
can be summarised thus. Carnivore-imparted
fractures on green bone are usually between
80 –110 (but generally not in the 85 –95
range, characteristic of dry breaks), while
human-imparted fractures (especially those along
oblique planes) are usually more acute (<80 ) or
more obtuse (>110 ). These differences are statistically significant, and most apparent on longitudinal and especially oblique fracture planes.
Except in cases with extreme angle values, frac-

ture angles on transverse planes are generally
ambiguous indicators of the agent of fracture.

Results
Results of the Swartkrans Member 3 limb bone
fracture analysis are summarised in Table 2.
Comparisons of mean values and 95% confidence
intervals between Member 3 and the experimental sample of Alcántara Garcı́a et al. (in press) are
summarised in Figure 3. For acute angle fractures
on longitudinal planes, the Swartkrans small
animal mean is identical to that of the modern
sample created by human percussion, while the
Swartkrans large animal mean falls comfortably
within the ranges of and close to the means of
both modern samples. Obtuse angle fractures on
longitudinal planes in both the small and large
animal Swartkrans samples have means identical
to that of the modern carnivore-derived sample,
but within the range of both modern samples.
The majority of fracture angle means on transverse planes in the Swartkrans sample are closest
to those in the modern human-derived sample.

angles on oblique planes in the Swartkrans small

human- and carnivore-derived samples. The
same can be said of the obtuse angle mean for
the Swartkrans large animal sample, while the
acute angle mean in that sample is outside the
range of the modern carnivore-derived sample.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that
both hominids and carnivores acted as agents of
bone fracture during the formation of the Swartkrans Member 3 faunal assemblage. This sugges-

the complementary classes of taphonomic data of

high mean values for obtuse angles (92.0 –
125.2 ) (Table 3). These values are indicative of
hammerstone percussion with reference to the
modern experimental sample (Table 1). This
corroboration between percussion-imparted surface damage and angle creation implies fairly
robust diagnostic value for the use of green break
angles in identifying dynamic fracture events.

Conversely, examination of fracture angles on
specimens that also bear tooth marks reveals
values in the high range for acute angles
(71.4 –80.8 ) and in the low range for obtuse
angles (106.8 –116.0 ) (Table 3). These values
match closely those observed in the experimental
sample created by carnivores (Table 1). These
observations are particularly important to

Limb Bone Fracture at Swartkrans
zooarchaeologists attempting to reconstruct
hominid involvement in the formation of an
archaeofauna that was also impacted by carnivores. As Henry Bunn (personal communication,
2004) reminded us, carnivore tooth marks can
sometimes occur on bone specimens first broken
open by hammerstone percussion, indicating that
carnivores were exploiting the most marginal
residues of bone resources first consumed by
hominids. The tight agreement between fracture
angle values in the Swartkrans tooth-marked
sample and those values in the modern carnivorecreated sample, implies this was an unlikely
scenario in the formation of the Member 3 limb
bone subassemblage. In other words, based on
fracture angle data, we posit minimal hominid–
carnivore interdependence in the creation of that
assemblage. This result supports our previous
conclusion based on the very low co-occurrence
of hominid butchery damage and carnivore tooth
marks on individual fossil specimens in Swartkrans Member 3 (Egeland et al., 2004; Pickering
et al., 2005).

Discussion and conclusions

Implications for understanding early
hominid behaviour at Swartkrans
Most of the well-known early hominid cave sites
in South Africa have faunal assemblages that
preserve scant zooarchaeological evidence of
hominid involvement in their accumulation (e.g.
Brain, 1981; Pickering, 1999, 2002). An exception is the presence of several cutmarked bone
specimens and many other burned pieces from
Swartkrans Member 3 documented by Brain
(1993a: 263) and leading him to suggest ‘that
hominids were using stone tools for the removal
of meat from bones while sitting round their
camp-fires’. Pickering et al.’s (2004a,b, 2005) reanalysis of the Member 3 ungulate limb bone
shaft subassemblage supplements Brain’s original
observations by expanding the cutmark count to
60 total specimens preserving such damage; and
we have reason to suspect that our continued
work on the remainder of the assemblage will
result in the identification of even more cutmarks
on specimens from other body regions.

In addition to the new cutmarked specimens,
we also documented 50 specimens with hammerstone percussion damage (3.5% of total analysed
specimens)2 and 532 with carnivore tooth
damage (36.3% of total analysed specimens); a
very few specimens preserve various combinations of cut, percussion and tooth damage
(Pickering et al., 2004a,b, 2005; Egeland et al.,
2004). Blumenschine & Selvaggio (1988) demonstrated that 30% of all specimens in experimental limb bone assemblages broken by human
percussion bear at least one percussion mark. In
order to compare the Swartkrans data to that
experimental standard, we adjusted the fossil data
to compensate for several factors common in
fossil bone assemblages but non-existent in the
modern comparative sample (Pickering et al.,
2005). One of these factors most relevant to
the current discussion is the prevalence of diagenetic fracture in the Member 3 archaeofauna
and its complete absence in modern assemblages.
Thus, we sampled randomly several hundred
specimens across various standardised size-range
categories, allowing assessment of the magnitude
of diagenetic breakage in the Swartkrans
assemblage as a whole. In summary, when the
Swartkrans data are adjusted to make them more
comparable to actualistic samples created by
Blumenschine & Selvaggio (1988) and others,
percussion-damaged specimens drop to 1.1%
(n ¼ 28) of the new total number of specimens
of 2641, and carnivore tooth marked specimens
rise to 5.1% (n ¼ 135) of the total (Pickering et al.,
2005).
Thus, whether considering raw or adjusted
values, the very low proportion of percussionmarked specimens in the Swartkrans sample,
contrasted with the higher incidence of carnivore-damaged specimens, indicates that carnivores were more active agents of bone fracture
than were hominids during the accumulation of
the assemblage. In addition, we also recognise
that some of the Swartkrans fractures that seemingly indicate carnivore activity may have been
2
This total includes specimens with percussion pits, striae and/or
notches, and is exclusive of an additional 53 impact flake specimens
(Pickering et al., 2004b, 2005). With regard to those impact flakes, it
is interesting to note that while too small to measure, almost all of
them preserve obtuse fracture angles. This means that the corresponding bone specimens from which they were detached will
preserve acute angles along their release surfaces.

created by other types of static loading on green
bones (such as sediment compaction as the
assemblage was forming on the cave floor). However, neither alternative (i.e. static loading by
carnivores or sediment pressure) changes an
inference of minimal bone breakage by hominids
employing dynamic hammerstone percussion.
That said, it is still important to note that the
new data presented here combined with those
published elsewhere (e.g. Pickering et al., 2004a,b,
2005; Egeland et al., 2004) hold the potential to
alter dramatically our views of early hominid
carcass foraging in southern Africa—which until
this point had been based on a total of only 15
cutmarked and chopmarked bone specimens from
Swartkrans and Sterkfontein (Brain, 1993a;
Pickering, 1999), and an unspecified but very
low number of hammerstone-percussed specimens from Swartkrans (Bishop & Blumenschine,
1994).3 In sum, our analyses have increased by
nearly 150 new specimens the total number of
hominid-butchered bones documented from all
known early Pleistocene South African archaeofaunas combined, and moves Swartkrans
Member 3 behind only FLK 22 Zinjanthropus
(Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) for the total number
of hominid-modified bones from the whole of
Africa (Pickering et al., 2005). In addition, the
current analysis of fracture angle patterns
corroborates our previous suggestion that the
hominid- and carnivore-derived portions of
Swartkrans Member 3 were contributed mostly
independently of one another (Egeland et al.,
2004; Pickering et al., 2005). This means that
the assemblage might offer palaeoanthropologists the unique opportunity to examine assemblage-formation behaviour by hominids in
relative isolation from ‘taphonomic overprints’
more common in faunas that formed under
higher degrees of interdependence between
hominids and carnivores.

Broader analytical implications
As discussed above, bone surface damage data in
Swartkrans Member 3 corroborate the conclu3
Brain & Sillen (1988; Brain, 1993c) have also reported the presence
of 270 burned bone specimens from Swartkrans Member 3, which
may have resulted from the fire-using activities of early hominids.

sions about site formation drawn independently
from data on limb bone fracture patterns. However, few other South African cave sites that yield
archaeological remains also have fossils with
cortices as well-preserved as those in Swartkrans
Member 3 (e.g. Sterkfontein Member 5;
Pickering, 1999). This limits the utility of bone
surface modification analyses in these other
assemblages; and the same situation characterises
many other Plio-Pleistocene faunas of potential
zooarchaeological importance. This might be
initially disheartening since bone surface modifications are currently one of the most powerful
sources of data in constructing inferences of early
hominid foraging behaviour. However, this also
creates the impetus for important work to establish other types of datasets and criteria that can
accurately differentiate the relative taphonomic
impact of carnivores and hominids in an archaeofauna. The archaeological results presented here
for Swartkrans Member 3 supplement the original
experimental findings of Alcántara Garcı́a et al. (in
press) on fracture patterns. They indicate further
that, while not ideal, the system can be used in
isolation to infer the relative contribution of early
hominid behaviour in poorly preserved faunal
assemblages.
