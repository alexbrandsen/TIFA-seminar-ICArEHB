In order to gain insight into the timing and nature of hominin ﬁre use, the effect of heat on the physical and chemical properties of the materials entering the archaeological record needs to be understood. The present study concerns the ﬁre proxy heated bone. Two types of heating can be distinguished: combustion (or burning, with
oxygen) and charring (without oxygen), for both of which the formation of char is the ﬁrst step. We performed
a series of controlled laboratory-based heating experiments, in reducing conditions (i.e. charring), covering a
broad temperature range (20–900 °C), and applied a variety of different analytical techniques. Results indicate
that charred bone shows a distinctly different thermal alteration trajectory than combusted bone, which has implications for the suitability of the different analytical techniques when identifying and determining past heating
conditions (charring vs. combustion; temperature) of heated bone from archaeological contexts. Combined, the
reference data and techniques presented in this study can be used as a robust toolkit for the characterisation of
archaeological charred bone from various ages and contexts.

1. Introduction
Fire has played a key role in the development of humankind and fundamentally changed our relationship with the world (Goudsblom,
1992). The chronological distribution of heated remains in the archaeological record of Europe suggests that ﬁre (the chemical process through
which heat is generated) has been an integral part of the human technological repertoire from the later Middle Pleistocene (~350 ka) onwards
(Roebroeks and Villa, 2011), an interpretation that ﬁts well with recently reported data on ﬁre use from the Levant (Shimelmitz et al., 2014).
Since ﬁre is used in various domestic and non-domestic settings, data
on its use are crucial for our understanding of human subsistence strategies, fuel management, various pyrotechnologies, mortuary practices,
and even landscape management (Scherjon et al., 2015; Théry-Parisot,
2002). In order to reconstruct the heating conditions archaeological
ﬁre remains were exposed to, and in turn gain insight into the timing
and nature of the speciﬁc human behaviour that produced them (e.g.
the function of ﬁreplaces), the effect of heat on the physical and chemical properties of the materials entering the archaeological record needs
to be understood.

For a ﬁre to be ignited, and remain ablaze, the three components of
the ﬁre triangle need to be present: heat from an external heat source,
oxygen, and a fuel (Emmons and Atreya, 1982). It is the carbon-rich organic part of the fuel that carries the energy that can be transformed
into heat. When organic matter is exposed to heat, thermal energy
will be absorbed, mainly through radiation, causing the temperature
of the material to increase. When temperatures approach around
300 °C, chemical reactions start to take place that gradually change
the original organic constituents of the material (i.e. charring)
(Braadbaart et al., 2007). This is a reaction that requires heat, but no oxygen, resulting in the formation of aromatic compounds (i.e. char) and
the release of volatile gasses (Braadbaart et al., 2007; Rein, 2009). This
ﬁrst charring is a necessary chemical step towards combustion. In
the presence of air, when temperatures remain sufﬁciently high
(N 300 °C), the char and volatiles oxidise (i.e. combustion), producing
more thermal energy and ﬂames. When the oxidation is completed,
all organic material will have been removed, leaving only ash (i.e. the
inorganic components of the fuel) (e.g. Braadbaart et al., 2012; Rein,
2009). In the absence of oxygen (i.e. charring), with increasing temperatures (N 400 °C), the molecular structure changes, resulting in the formation of polyaromatic, planar sheets and increased ordering of the
char (e.g. Braadbaart and Poole, 2008). It is important to note that two
types of heating can be distinguished: combustion (or burning) and
charring, both of which require the formation of char. Consequently,

F.H. Reidsma et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports 10 (2016) 282–292

charring is not restricted to reducing conditions. In addition, it should be
noted that the physical and chemical properties of heated materials do
not just depend on temperature and the presence or absence of oxygen,
but also on other heating conditions, such as heating rate (°C/min) and
exposure time (Braadbaart et al., 2007; Rein, 2009).
While a lot of work has been done on the effect of heat on organic
materials, particularly on wood (e.g. Ascough et al., 2008; Braadbaart
and Poole, 2008; Cohen-Ofri et al., 2006; Scott, 2010), the understanding of another common bioorganic ﬁre residue, heated bone, is far
more fragmentary. The presence of a high amount of inorganic compounds in bone makes it distinct from wood and other organic plant
and/or animal tissues. While wood is composed of only about 2 wt% inorganic compounds (Braadbaart and Poole, 2008), bone on average contains 70 wt% inorganic material (White and Folkens, 2005). Bone is a
composite material in which equal volumes of the organic and inorganic
constituents are intimately intergrown (for details see Section 2)
(Pasteris et al., 2014). Because of these speciﬁc properties, bone is affected differently by heat, than organic compounds, for example in terms of
the ease with which air - and thus oxygen - disperses into the material.
Combined with the prevalence of heated bone in the archaeological record, this highlights the importance of research focussing on heated
bone.
Initially, studies in this direction concentrated on the macroscopically visible manifestations of heating (e.g. Kalsbeek and Richter, 2006;
Shipman et al., 1984; Stiner et al., 1995). Later, focus was shifted towards the physical and chemical changes underlying the visible manifestations by applying a broad range of analytical techniques including
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (e.g. Ellingham et al., 2015b; Etok
et al., 2007; Haberko et al., 2006; Jankovic et al., 2009; Lozano et al.,
2003; Mkukuma et al., 2004), x-ray ﬂuorescence (XRF) (e.g. Kalsbeek
and Richter, 2006; Thompson et al., 2011), x-ray diffraction (XRD)
(e.g. Enzo et al., 2007; Piga et al., 2008; Rogers and Daniels, 2002), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (e.g. Figueiredo et al., 2010;
Lebon et al., 2008, 2010; Mkukuma et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2009,
2013), Raman spectroscopy (e.g. Pasteris et al., 2004), and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) (e.g. Koon et al., 2003, 2010). While all of
these studies discuss the thermal alteration of bone, they all concern
combustion (i.e. heating in the presence of air), with the exception of
Mkukuma et al. (2004), and generally focus on just one or two analytical
methods, a limited temperature range or the effect of heat on one speciﬁc bone property (e.g. crystallinity). This means we only have a partial
understanding of the range of heated bone potentially available in the
archaeological record, both in terms of heating conditions (e.g. charring
vs. combustion; temperature) and of the interaction of the organic and
inorganic properties targeted by the different analytical techniques.
In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of
heating (i.e. the chemical process of ﬁre) on the physical and chemical
properties of bone, we performed a series of controlled laboratorybased heating experiments, in reducing conditions (i.e. charring), covering a broad temperature range (20–900 °C), and applied a variety of different analytical techniques. This allows us to gain insight in the effect of
heat on both the organic and inorganic compounds in bone and their interaction, as well as assess the usefulness of the different techniques for
the reconstruction of heating conditions in archaeological contexts. The
combination of techniques applied in this study was chosen in order to
infer changes in physical (colour, mass loss, TGA, reﬂectance analysis),
elemental (XRF, CHN), molecular (FTIR, Raman, DTMS), and structural
(XRD) properties. Furthermore, this speciﬁc combination of techniques
allows us to address changes in bone organic and inorganic content separately, as well as combined. By taking the process of charring as a
starting point, we were able to exert more control over the experimental conditions and provide valuable initial baseline data for further
research. From an archaeological perspective, improving our understanding of charred bone is important since the presence of charred organic materials, including bone, in the archaeological record implies
that not all char is oxidised during heating, even though the presence

283

of air may be expected in an open ﬁre. It should be noted that charring
can also occur within an open ﬁre (Albini, 1993). The data generated by
this study will help archaeologists identify the full range of heated bone
and reconstruct the heating conditions (e.g. temperature; charring vs.
combustion) bones from the archaeological record were exposed to.
Shedding more light on ﬁre function and speciﬁc human behaviour
(e.g. Braadbaart and Poole, 2008). Furthermore, this study provides
the ﬁrst comparative standard for charred bone that archaeologists
can use when reconstructing the taphonomic history of bones heated
in the past. Essentially, gaining insight into the process of charring is
the necessary ﬁrst step towards understanding combustion and the effect of diagenesis on heated bone.
2. What is bone?
Bone tissue is a composite material that consists of three major
parts: a large inorganic fraction (about 70 wt%), a much smaller organic
fraction (about 20 wt%), and water (about 10 wt%). The relative proportions of these constituents depend on the type of bone (cortical or trabecular) and may vary as a result of development and pathology
(Kuhn et al., 2008; Pasteris, 2014; Weiner, 2010, 102, 105; White and
Folkens, 2005, 33). The organic fraction mainly consists of an assortment of proteins, of which about 90% belong to a single type known as
‘type I collagen’ (Boskey, 2007; Weiner, 2010, 105). Collagen is
characterised by a triple helical structure formed by amino acid chains
(polypeptides) (White and Folkens, 2005, 42). The collagen molecules
intertwine to form ﬂexible, slightly elastic ﬁbres, which give the bone
its supple properties (Boskey, 2007). These ﬁbrillar structures are held
together by strong hydrogen bonds (Adamiano et al., 2013).
The inorganic fraction of bone consists of plate shaped nanocrystals
that are intimately associated, in equal volumes, with the organic matrix, by occupying the empty spaces between the collagen ﬁbrils and individual molecules (Boskey, 2007; Rey et al., 2009). It is these minerals
that give the bone its hardness and rigidity (Weiner, 2010, 104; White
and Folkens, 2005, 33, 42). Bone mineral is often described as a poorly
crystalline carbonated hydroxylapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), closely resembling geological hydroxylapatite (HAP). However, this is a persistent misconception that impedes a full understanding of thermal
alteration in bone. While the material has an atomic arrangement very
similar to HAP, bone mineral is a highly disordered (non-stoichiometric) apatite, containing a large degree of carbonate substitutions (3–
8 wt%), lattice vacancies and various other ionic substitutions (e.g.
HPO4, Na, Mg) (Boskey, 2007; Figueiredo et al., 2010; Kuhn et al.,
2008; Lebon et al., 2008; Pasteris et al., 2004; Rey et al., 2009; Weiner,
2010, 86). In addition, recent studies have shown that bone mineral is
depleted in hydroxyl ions (OH−) and contains water in its apatite structure (Pasteris et al., 2012, 2014; Wopenka and Pasteris, 2005), making it
distinct from geological hydroxylapatite. Furthermore, mature bone
may lose its HPO24 − ions (Pasteris, 2014; Wopenka and Pasteris,
2005). Within this study, the term ‘bone mineral’ is therefore used to
deﬁne a hydrated hydroxyl-depleted carbonated calcium phosphate
phase (Ca10 − x[(PO4)6 − x(CO3, HPO4)x](OH)2 − x·nH2O) (cf. Pasteris
et al., 2004, 2014; Wopenka and Pasteris, 2005).
3. Materials and methods
3.1. Sample preparation and heating experiments
Samples were taken from the cortical part of the femur of a mature
(9 years old) female bovine (Bos taurus). Bovine bone was chosen as
an analogy for the large herbivore bones dominating most Pleistocene
assemblages. Flesh and fat were mechanically removed, after which
the bone was further cleaned with water at a temperature of 40 °C
and air-dried. Cleaned bone was cut into longitudinal samples measuring approximately 5 × 5 × 35 mm. All samples were cut from the same
bone.

284

F.H. Reidsma et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports 10 (2016) 282–292

All samples were individually charred to the required temperature.
The temperatures used for this study include 200, 250, 300, 340, 370,
400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C and are based on previous research (Braadbaart, 2004). Additionally, one sample was left unheated
(20 °C), making for a total of 13 samples. Charring was done under controlled conditions using a Carbolite tube oven (model MTF 12/38/250).
Individual samples were placed in an open Pyrex© vessel and inserted
into a 30 cm long Pyrex© tube 18 cm from the inlet. Samples were heated for 60 min in the preheated oven, at atmospheric pressure and under
constant nitrogen ﬂow (150 ml/min) (cf. Braadbaart et al., 2009). Volatiles were vented. Samples were cooled for 24 h outside the oven, in
closed sample vials, and then powdered by hand using an agate pestle
and mortar. The unheated sample was powdered by gently sawing the
sample with a hand saw. Subsequent analyses were all performed on
the charred bone samples produced during these heating experiments,
as well as on the unheated control sample.
3.2. Physical analysis
3.2.1. Colour
Bone colour was determined on the powdered samples using the
Munsell Soil Color chart (Munsell, 1954).
3.2.2. Mass loss
All samples were weighed before and after heating in order to determine the mass loss during each heating experiment. Weighing was
done after cooling to ensure acclimatisation.
3.2.3. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
TGA was performed on a minimal amount of 1 mg of powdered sample, using a LECO TGA 701. Samples were heated to 950 °C with a
heating rate of 5 °C/min using air as the carrier gas to ensure complete
combustion. The water content was determined as the mass loss at
200 °C, the organic content as the mass loss between 200 and 600 °C,
and the ash content as the remaining mass at 950 °C.
3.2.4. Reﬂectance analysis
Reﬂectance analysis was performed on the bone samples charred to
300 °C and beyond. Samples were embedded in resin blocks and
polished in accordance with the international standard methods deﬁned in ISO 7404, part 2 (1985). Mean reﬂectance values were obtained
by measuring a total of 100 randomly selected points (i.e. a statistically
acceptable population). Reﬂectance was measured under oil immersion
at a wavelength of 546 nm, using a Leitz motorised DMLA microscope
equipped with an xyz-stage and a Basler video camera, in accordance
with the international standard methods deﬁned in ISO 7404, part 5
(1994).
3.3. Elemental analysis
3.3.1. X-ray ﬂuorescence (XRF)
The elemental composition (elements with atomic number ≥12) of
powdered sample was measured using a hand-held Thermo Scientiﬁc
Niton XL3t XRF device with a GOLDD detector equipped with a silver
anode operating at a maximum of 50 kV and 40 μA. Measurement
time was set to 110 s and measurements were taken in triplicate. Quantiﬁcation of the elements is based on the presence of oxides. Results are
presented as wt% of the dry organic free content (dof).
The machine is factory calibrated and results are used as received.
The following reference materials were used to check the internal calibration: high Ca and P was checked with Breitlander (Br) SP2, A3, B2b, C3, D2, E2, and F2A. Trace elements and medium level Ca and P and
other major elements were checked with reference material from:
ANTR (FK-N, UB-N), IGGE (GSD-1, GSD-2, GSD-3, GSD-4), GSJ (JA-2,
JB-3, JG-1a, JG-2, JGb-2, JSd-1, JSd-2) USGS, (MAG-1, PCC-1), NIST
(NISTSRM2710), MINTEK (SARM52, SARM2, SARM6), CCRMP (SO-1),

and pure calcite (J.T.Baker chemicals). Reference values and measured
values were positively correlated (r2 N 0.98). The performed measurements are semi-quantitative, as bone is not mineralogical equivalent
to the standards used. However, since all analysed samples have the
same matrix, the obtained results are mutually comparable.
3.3.2. CHN analysis
Carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and nitrogen (N) analysis was executed in
triplicate on powdered sample using a NA 1500 series 2 NC analyser
from Fisons Instruments. The temperature in the ﬂash combustion reactor was maintained at 1020 °C, and the combustion products (CO2, H2O
and N2O) were separated on a Porapak QS column with a length of 2 m.
Results are presented as wt% of the dry ash free content (daf).
3.4. Molecular analysis
3.4.1. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
Single measurements were performed on powdered sample using
an Attenuated Total Reﬂectance (ATR) Perkin Elmer Spectrum100 FTIR spectrometer, equipped with a diamond ATR crystal. Absorption
spectra were accumulated in 16 scans, for the 4000–450 cm−1 wavelength range, with a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. Spectra were background corrected and normalised on the highest peak. The FTIR
splitting factor (SF), which is often used to deﬁne crystallinity, is calculated following Weiner and Bar-Yosef (1990). The C/P (carbonate/phosphate) ratio was calculated using the height of the carbonate absorption
−1
peak at 1417 cm−1 (CO2–
3 υ3) and the phosphate peak at 1015 cm
3−
(PO4 υ3).
3.4.2. Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectra were obtained with a PerkinElmer RamanMicro 300
Raman microscope equipped with a 785 nm laser. Single measurements
were taken on powdered sample, for the 2000–400 cm−1 wavelength
range. Spectra were baseline corrected and normalised to the height
of the 959 cm−1 peak.
3.4.3. Direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry (DTMS)
Single measurements of powdered sample were taken using a JEOL
SX-102A double focussing mass spectrometer (B/E), with a direct insertion probe equipped with a Pt/Rh (9/1) ﬁlament for analysis under electron ionization (EI) conditions (for details see Braadbaart et al., 2007).
3.5. Structural analysis
3.5.1. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
Powdered sample was attached to an amorphous silica plate using
resin. Analysis was carried out using a Bruker D8 Discover XRD
equipped with a 2D General Area Detector Diffraction System
(GADDS) detector. A copper target X-ray tube (8 mm) was used and operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The measurements were collected in the 16–
68° 2θ range, with a step size of 0.04° 2θ and a step time of 5 s.
Diffractograms were background corrected and normalised to their
highest peak. Measurements were performed on untreated samples.
The XRD-crystallinity index (CI) was determined following Person et
al. (1995). The width of the [002] reﬂection was used to monitor changes in crystal size and/or strain (cf. Person et al., 1995; Rogers and
Daniels, 2002).
4. Results
4.1. Physical analysis
4.1.1. Colour
Bone colour (Fig. 1, Table 1) changed from white through yellowwhite and yellow to reddish brown at 300 °C, after this initial change

the bones darkened to black with increasing temperature at 600 °C and
higher (cf. Munsell, 1954).

4.2. Elemental analysis
4.2.1. XRF
Results of the XRF analysis are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 2 and indicate that with increasing temperature and temperature-dependant
mass loss both the Ca and P content (dof) remain stable (Ca: 43.04 ±
0.71 wt%, P: 22.99 ± 0.69 wt%).

4.1.2. Mass loss
Mass loss during heating occurs in two stages (Fig. 2, Table 1): below
370 °C the increase in mass loss follows an approximately linear trend
from 10.53 wt% at 200 °C to 24.93 wt% at 370 °C (± 6 wt%/100 °C),
above 400 °C the increase in mass loss slows down to an approximately
linear trend of 1.3 wt%/100 °C, from 25.79 wt% at 400 °C to 33.93 wt% at
900 °C.

4.2.2. CHN analysis
The C content shows an increase of ±15% between 200 and 450 °C,
from 49.08 to 63.20 daf wt%, after which the C level remains stable
(mean: 63.7 ± 0.8 daf wt%) (Table 1, Fig. 4). The N content gradually decreases ±4% towards 450 °C, from 14.10 daf wt% at 200 °C to 9.71 daf
wt% at 450 °C, and then remains stable as well (mean: 9.8 ± 0.8 daf
wt%). Results indicate no changes in the H content (mean: 7.33 ± 0.6
daf wt%). Values for the sample heated to 900 °C appeared to be
overestimated, due to insufﬁcient sample size, and were therefore not
included.

4.1.3. TGA
A number of temperature-dependant trends can be observed in the
TGA results (Table 1, Fig. 3). Below 200–250 °C mass loss is related to the
loss of the free and structural (organic) water content. Between 250 and
500 °C a steep decline in the organic content of approximately 8 wt%/
100 °C can be observed. This decline slows down between 500 and
800 °C to approximately 1.2 wt%/100 °C. In the ﬁnal stage (800–
900 °C) the organic content drops towards 1 wt%. Independently from
temperature, inorganic mass loss can be seen to ﬂuctuate around 2.8
wt%.

4.3. Molecular analysis
4.3.1. FTIR
FTIR was applied to assess the changes in the mineral and organic fraction of bone under the present experimental conditions (Table 2, Fig. 5).
The spectrum for unheated bone is characterised by a dominant peak at
1015 cm−1, which represents the PO3−
υ3 asymmetric stretching. The
4
presence of this peak at this particular location indicates that bone mineral is a non-stoichiometric apatite with substitutions of CO3 and/or HPO4 in
its crystal lattice (Paschalis et al., 1996). The PO3−
υ1 symmetric

4.1.4. Reﬂectance analysis
Reﬂectance analysis was performed to assess changes in the molecular structure of the aromatic compounds. Unfortunately, due to the intimate association and nano scale of the organic and mineral fraction in
bone, the target area could not be identiﬁed and reﬂectance could not be
measured. This problem could be addressed by testing if reﬂectance
analysis can be performed on charred collagen that has been chemically
extracted from the bone tissue.

mainly Type 1 collagen, is represented by a number of amide peaks.
Amide A and B N\\H stretching can be observed at 3288 cm−1 and
3086 cm−1, respectively (Berzina-Cimdina and Borodajenko, 2012;
Figueiredo et al., 2010, 2012). Two smaller peaks in this region, at 2959
cm−1 and 2887 cm−1, represent the CH2 asymmetric and symmetric
wagging. Another CH2 wagging peak overlaps with the CO2–
3 υ3 peaks
(Figueiredo et al., 2012; Vranceanu et al., 2012). Amide I (C_O
stretching), II (C\\N stretch and N\\H bend), and III (C\\N stretch and
N\\H bend) can be found at 1635 cm−1, 1546 cm−1, and 1235 cm−1, respectively (Alvarez-Lloret et al., 2006; Figueiredo et al., 2012; Lin et al.,
2007; Vranceanu et al., 2012). Finally, the elevated area between 500
and 750 cm−1 can be attributed to the overlapping vibrations of amide
IV–VII (Figueiredo et al., 2012; Vranceanu et al., 2012).
From 200 °C onwards a number of changes can be observed in the
FTIR spectra (Table 2, Fig. 5). Between 200 and 340 °C there is a decrease
in absorption of the amide peaks. At the same time the water content
can be seen to decrease. Less pronounced changes can be observed for
the phosphate and carbonate peaks between 250 and 340 °C. There is

a modest decrease in carbonate content (CO2–

of 600/700 °C are reached. At 600 °C splitting of the PO3−
υ4 bending
4
(splitting factor) starts to occur, which becomes more pronounced between 700 and 900 °C (increase in SF of ±0.25/100 °C, Table 1). In tan2–
dem, the CO2–
3 υ3 symmetric and asymmetric stretching and CO3 υ2
out of phase bending (or HPO2−
υ2 bending) can be seen to decline,
4
from 600 and 700 °C onwards, respectively, resulting in a decrease in
the C/P ratio (Table 1). In addition, new peaks appear at ~2020 and ~
700 cm−1 from 700 °C onwards, which increase in intensity towards
900 °C. Finally, a new shoulder appears on the PO34 − υ3 symmetric
stretching at 1087 cm−1 when temperatures of 900 °C are reached.
4.3.2. Raman
The Raman results for unheated bone (20 °C) show a typical spectrum for bone with a high and narrow symmetric PO4 band near 959
cm− 1 (not shown). However, upon heating the background ﬂuorescence increases, obscuring the signal of the symmetric PO4 band from
temperatures as low as 250 °C onwards. The background ﬂuorescence

comm.), indicating that it is not simply related to the presence of organic compounds. Raman spectrometry is therefore only deemed useful for
the analysis of heated bone with the addition of measures addressing
the ﬂuorescence problem.

4.3.3. DTMS
The total ion current (TIC) in the untreated bone sample is
characterised by one dominant peak resulting from the dissociation of
the proteins (not shown). The spectrum of unheated bone shows a
range of mass peaks that are typical of the presence of collagen in the
sample. Mass peaks m/z 154, 111, 98, 83, 70, 55 and 41 are attributed
to fragments of the dipeptide glycine-proline (Stankiewicz et al., 1996,
1997), which forms an important part (ca. 40%) of the collagen in bone
(Fig. 6A). Hydroxyproline (ca. 10%) is characterised by mass peaks m/z
210, 186, 138, 94 and 80. Pyrrole (m/z 67, 80, 94) and pyrroline (m/z
41) are derived from both proline (ca. 12%) and hydroxyproline. Mass
peak m/z 136 is tentatively attributed to an alkylated homologue of pyrrole. Alanine (ca. 10%), here considered as the proline-alanine dipeptide,
is characterised by m/z 70. A small lipid fraction is represented by the
fatty acids m/z 256 (M), C16:0; m/z 260 (M-H2O), C18:3; m/z 278 (M),
C18:3 and m/z 284 (M), C18:0. The origin of mass peaks like m/z 124,
164 and 170 cannot be attributed to any amino acid or dipeptide.

From 200 °C onwards, the DTMS spectra show mass peaks that describe the temperature-dependant conversion of the protein rich material. The spectra of the samples heated to 200 and 300 °C are still
characterised by the proteins present in the collagen (not shown). In
the sample heated to 340 °C (Fig. 6B) the collagen mass peaks, of relatively low intensity, are accompanied by a series related to new compounds. The latter are recognised as clusters of three mass peaks with
CH2 (14) mass increments such as m/z 146, 147, 148; 160, 161, 162,
etc., which correspond to homologue series of condensed aromatic
compounds (Braadbaart, 2004, 125 and references cited therein). In addition, mass peaks related to alkylated phenols and benzenes, such as
m/z 91, 92, 94, 107, 108 and 122, can now be observed. These compounds are typical products resulting from the thermal degradation of
organic material like protein (Braadbaart et al., 2007). At 340 °C the
thermal degradation of lipids is complete and no markers for this compound are observed. The spectrum of the sample heated to 370 °C has a
different conﬁguration (Fig. 6C). Protein markers are no longer observed and the spectrum is now characterised by masses representing
condensed aromatic compounds. Finally, at temperatures higher than
400 °C the material is characterised by a very low amount of pyrolysis
products (not shown). These spectra show mass peaks m/z 28 (CO)
and 44 (CO2) derived from O-containing poly-aromates. Additionally,
masses representing N-containing compounds are observed, such as
m/z 27 (HCN), 41 (CH3CN), and 42 (H2CN2). The continued presence
of m/z 44 relates to the presence of CO2 that is released during the thermal degradation of organic compounds as well as carbonates.

4.4.1. XRD
The results of the XRD analysis are presented in Fig. 7. The
diffractogram of unheated bone shows a spectrum typical for bone mineral with a relatively sharp peak corresponding to the [002] diffraction,
followed by a larger broad peak resulting from the combined [202],
[300], [112] and [211] diffractions also seen in hydroxylapatite
(Person et al., 1995). Changes in the crystal structure can be observed
to start around 600 °C and is visible as the increasing separation of the
combined [202], [300], [112] and [211] peaks, resulting in increased
crystallinity. This can also be observed from the XRD-CI (Table 1). Crystallinity increases gradually from 700 to 800 °C (from 0.02 to 0.04), and
exponentially towards 900 °C (0.43). An increase in crystal size and/or
decrease in strain, as measured through the decrease in peak width of

the [002] diffraction, was only observed for the sample heated to 900 °C
(Table 1). The formation of calcium pyrophosphate (Ca2P2O7) and βtricalciumphosphate (β-TCP) (e.g. Meejoo et al., 2006) was not observed in our sample. However, this is not surprising as these compounds have been found not to develop in bone until temperatures of
around 1200 °C are reached (Rogers and Daniels, 2002; Younesi et al.,
2011).
5. Discussion
The results of the different analytical techniques are combined to address the aims of this paper: determining the inﬂuence of heating under
reducing conditions on the organic and inorganic content of bone, and
determining the applicability of the various analytical techniques in addressing archaeological questions related to the identiﬁcation of heatinduced changes in charred bone and reconstructing past heating conditions. Gaining insight into charred bone and the methods available
to analyse this material is an important prerequisite for a comprehensive understanding of the full range of types of heated bone present in
the archaeological record, including combusted bone, as well as diagenetically altered heated bones, both charred and combusted.
5.1. The effect of heat: organic content
The ﬁrst phase of heat-induced alteration is characterised by dehydration reactions resulting in the loss of the free water content up to
100 °C and loss of a large part of the chemically bound water between
100 and 200 °C (TGA, FTIR). Thermal alteration of the proteins is initiated
at around 200 °C, as shown by the decrease in collagen markers (200–
300 °C) and conversion into alkylated benzenes and phenols, and condensed aromatic compounds (300–340 °C) (DTMS). Loss of water continues to occur during this second phase (see FTIR) related to the
release of volatile gasses (Shaﬁzadeh, 1975). From 370 °C onwards, the
organic content of bone mainly consists of aromatic compounds. The
thermal conversion of protein is accompanied by an increase in C content
(200–450 °C) and a decrease in N content (250–450 °C) (CHN). From
around 500 °C onwards (but only clearly visible in the FTIR from
700 °C), the aromatic content slowly declines until at 900 °C only a
very small amount is left (TGA, FTIR). Despite the decline in organic content the residues remain black at these temperatures. It is striking that
data presented on bone heated in oxidising conditions shows that the organic content decreases at a faster rate than in charred bone (Ellingham
et al., 2015b), and is commonly completely lost around 650 °C (e.g.
Munro et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2013). Interestingly, DTMS and
FTIR appear to suggest that between 400 and 600 °C further molecular
changes occur in the char; the aromatic compounds are still present
based on FTIR, but only give a minimal signal in the DTMS. Unfortunately,
reﬂectance analysis to assess the molecular structure of the organic compounds, cannot be applied to thermally altered protein in bone due to its
intimate association with the bone mineral. However, previous research
indicated that heat treatment under reducing conditions of biomolecules,
like proteins and polysaccharides (i.e. the main constituent of wood),
produces solid residues, composed of aromatic compounds, which are increasingly similar and ultimately indistinguishable (Braadbaart, 2004,
80). This suggests that the increased ordering and formation of poly-aromatic, planar sheets seen at higher temperatures (N400 °C) in charcoal
would also take place in the aromatic compounds present in charred
bone (for details see Braadbaart and Poole, 2008; Braadbaart et al.,
2009). Finally, the formation of new compounds was observed between
700 and 900 °C (Fig. 5). These peaks, at ~2020 and ~700 cm−1, have been
attributed to cyanamide (CN2−
2 ), which may form at elevated temperatures as the result of a reaction between the calcium of the bone mineral
and residual C and N from the organic content (Dowker and Elliott,
1979). This is in agreement with our CHN and DTMS (m/z 27, 42, 43) results, which indicate the continued presence of N within the three-dimensional network of the char (Braadbaart et al., 2007). Nevertheless,

289

at present, the exact reaction resulting in the formation of cyanamide
in our sample remains unclear.

5.2. The effect of heat: inorganic content
Thermal alteration of the bone mineral mainly concerns reordering
of the phosphate (PO4) crystals and a decrease in carbonate (CO3) content, as the Ca and P content remain stable during heating (Table 1).
Mild changes in the former properties can be observed in the FTIR spectra from 250° to 340 °C. However, these are likely an artefact of the
changes in organic content that occur around these temperatures and
with which spectral locations are shared (e.g. overlap of CO3 υ3 and amides/CH2 wagging). Between 340 and 600 °C CO3 and PO4 properties
ﬂuctuate slightly, but no real changes occur. From temperatures of
600/700 °C more severe alterations start to occur in the bone mineral,
with the most pronounced changes concentrating between 800 and
900 °C. Changes at these high temperatures relate to increased ordering
of the crystal structure (N600 °C, but most pronounced at 900 °C) and
increased crystal size and/or decreased strain (~ 900 °C) (FTIR, XRD).
Additionally, these changes are accompanied by loss of structurally
bound water and carbonate (FTIR). It should be noted that thermal alteration of the bone mineral appears to occur at a slower rate during
charring than during combustion. For example, Thompson et al.
(2013) reported C/P ratio values for combusted bone that dropped
below 0.10 between 600 and 700 °C, whereas for our study this did
not happen until 900 °C was reached. Similarly, XRD-CI values for our
samples remain virtually unchanged until 900 °C, while those reported
for combusted bone by Munro et al. (2007) steadily increase from temperatures of 275 °C onwards (from 0.07 to 1.27 at 900 °C).
It has been suggested that at elevated temperatures rehydroxylation
reactions occur that introduce hydroxyl (OH−) back into the apatite
structure (e.g. Pasteris et al., 2012; Snoeck et al., 2014). This change
has been explained as the result of thermal breakdown of CO3 and reaction with structural water or HPO4, resulting in the release of CO2 and
the formation of OH− and P2O4−
(when HPO4 is involved) (Pasteris et
7
al., 2012). While a reduction in carbonate and structural water can be
observed in our samples (N 600/700 °C, but most pronounced at
900 °C), no traces of hydroxyl or pyrophosphate were observed in our
samples (FTIR/XRD). Based on the present data, the lack of
rehydroxylation in our charred bone samples cannot be explained.
However, it may be related to the continued presence of organic material within our temperature range.

5.3. Implications for archaeological research: identiﬁcation and heating
conditions
5.3.1. Colour
Traditionally, heated bones are identiﬁed on the basis of their colour
and morphology, both characteristics that can be fairly easily recognised
with the naked eye, as opposed to requiring the aid of analytical techniques (Shipman et al., 1984; Stiner et al., 1995). Our results show
that colour can also be used to distinguish between unheated and heated bones, when bones are heated under reducing conditions. However,
due to the absence of oxygen, our bones display a different colour range
than those described in studies focussing on bones heated in air (e.g.
Munro et al., 2007). Additionally, bone colour may also vary as a result
of varying exposure time (e.g. 60 min vs. 120 min). Consequently, colour can only be used as a rough indication of the heating conditions
(i.e. charring vs. combustion; temperature). It should be noted that
post-depositional processes may alter the colour of both heated and unheated bones in such a way that they become increasingly similar (e.g.
Shahack-Gross et al., 1997). Considering the possibility of variations in
bone colour, it is suggested that this characteristic is merely used as a
starting point for further research.

5.3.2. TGA
Archaeological samples of charred bone can be compared to the reference data provided in this paper (Fig. 3), allowing quantitative temperature reconstructions. Future research will supplement this
correlation curve with more extensive experimental data on the effect
of oxygen, exposure time and various diagenetic pathways.
5.3.3. CHN
Elemental composition has the potential to be used to infer temperature and identify heat-induced changes in bone heated under reducing
conditions by measuring the C and N content (daf), which showed temperature-dependant changes (Fig. 4). However, temperature estimates
will only be semi-quantitative as the changes in both elements level
off at 450 °C.
5.3.4. FTIR
FTIR has been applied to bone experimentally heated under
oxidising conditions and on archaeological material, either with a
focus on curve-ﬁtting or on crystallinity indices (e.g. Berna et al.,
2012; Lebon et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2009, 2013). Our results indicate that FTIR has the potential to be used to identify heat-induced alterations in bone heated under reducing conditions in the same manner, as
well as the potential to be used to infer past heating temperature. However, since the type and speed of heat-induced alterations in bone heated under reducing conditions appear to differ from those in bone heated
under oxidising conditions, caution should be taken when determining
heating temperature. Therefore, the reference data provided in this
paper (Tables 1 + 2, Fig. 5) should be used when analysing charred
bone or be used in addition to reference data for combusted bone whenever the heating conditions are unclear. Furthermore, we suggest applying statistics such as Principle Component Analysis when determining
heating conditions (temperature and/or charring vs. combustion), as
this will allow for more accurate interpretations (Braadbaart, 2004). Finally, it should be noted that diagenesis may affect FTIR results (e.g.
Hollund et al., 2013). Research into the effect of different diagenetic
pathways is therefore needed to supplement the reference data presented here.
5.3.5. DTMS
Mass spectrometry also has the potential to be used to identify heatinduced changes in bone heated under reducing conditions and determine maximum heating temperature. However, due to the nature of
the method, it can only be used to describe changes in the organic components of a material. DTMS cannot be used to distinguish between
charring and combustion since both heating conditions produce the
same products for the temperature range DTMS can be applied to,
b400 °C. However, for higher temperatures reﬂectance analysis
may be used, as this method also depends on the molecular structure
of the compounds, provided that the mineral component of the bone
tissue can be removed.
5.3.6. XRD
Because XRD focuses on the inorganic fraction of bone, the method,
as applied in our study, can only be used to identify heat-induced changes in bone heated under reducing conditions to temperatures of 600 °C
or higher, with the clearest change visible around 900 °C. However, the
increase in crystallinity (CI) seen in bones heated to these temperatures
can also be the result of diagenesis (e.g. Ellingham et al., 2015a). XRD is
therefore only useful for determining heating conditions (temperature
and/or charring vs. combustion) in conjunction with other analytical
techniques. With regard to the use of the crystallinity index (CI), it
should be noted that different deﬁnitions of the concept exist that characterise crystallinity in slightly different ways. For example, Termine
and Posner (1966) deﬁne crystallinity as the relative percentage by
weight of crystalline material, whereas Reyes-Gasga et al. (2013) describe it as the relative volume of crystalline material. Furthermore,

the CI can be calculated either based on peak height (e.g. Person et al.,
1995; Weiner and Bar-Yosef, 1990) or based on the area under and/or
between certain peaks (e.g. Termine and Posner, 1966), which have
been shown to result in different values (Park et al., 2010). One can
imagine the same problems apply to the FTIR splitting factor. Because
of these issues and on-going discussion about the meaning of different
CI values (e.g. see Thompson et al., 2013), care should be taken when
applying this approach to archaeological material.
5.3.7. Toolkit approach
In order to enhance the robusticity of the interpretations of archaeological charred bone, different analytical techniques should be combined. Bone is a bioinorganic material composed of intimately
associated organic and inorganic components, which results show
react differently to heat, e.g. at different temperatures. Gaining comprehensive insight into past heating conditions from heated bone therefore
requires the use of a combination of techniques that target both the organic and inorganic content. In addition, the various analytical techniques target different aspects of the bone, e.g. elemental composition
(CHN and XRF) versus molecular composition (FTIR and DTMS) versus
physical properties (TGA and XRD). All of these give you different levels
of inference, which come with their own speciﬁc limitations. By combining techniques that target different aspects of bone these limitations
can be partially circumvented, resulting in more accurate interpretations of the archaeological material.
6. Conclusion
The use of ﬁre has played a deﬁning role within the development of
humankind. Heated bone, being more taphonomically durable than
charcoal due to the presence of a large mineral component, forms an important source of information for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the history and speciﬁcs of ﬁre use through time. It is therefore
essential to be able to unambiguously identify heated bone in the archaeological record, to trace back when and where ﬁre was used, and
to reliably determine past heating conditions, such as temperature
and oxygen level, in order to infer ﬁre function. More fundamental research geared towards identiﬁcation and explanation of the observed
changes in thermally altered bone is needed. Data of this nature will
have the advantage of being applicable to different contexts, and will
not only allow for a better understanding of past heating conditions,
but also provide insight into the preservation potential of differentially
heated bone.
Through a series of controlled laboratory-based heating experiments
and the application of a broad range of analytical techniques, this study
demonstrates that bone heated under reducing conditions shows a different thermal alteration trajectory than bone heated in the presence of
oxygen. In the absence of oxidation reactions the loss of organic compounds is slowed down. As a result of thermal shielding, changes in
the inorganic fraction of bone are delayed or prevented entirely. These
ﬁndings reafﬁrm the importance of considering charring and combustion as two different processes, as well as highlight the importance of
considering the speciﬁc heating conditions when analysing archaeological material. By focussing on the process of charring, this study provides
valuable initial reference data for the study of an important, yet still underrepresented part of the full range of heated bone potentially available in the archaeological record.
The difference between the physical and chemical properties of bone
heated with and without oxygen has implications for the suitability of
the different analytical techniques when identifying and determining
past heating conditions of heated bone from archaeological contexts.
The results of this study show that different/additional reference data
is required for the characterisation of charred bone. In addition, the retarded effect of heat on the organic and inorganic fraction renders certain techniques, such as XRD, less useful for the analysis of charred
bone. In order to increase the robusticity of the obtained data, it is

F.H. Reidsma et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports 10 (2016) 282–292

advisable to apply a combination of techniques that target both the organic and mineral components of bone. This will also allow some of the
limitations of the individual techniques to be negated. Results suggest
the most effective toolkit for analysing archaeological charred bone includes at least a combination of TGA, DTMS and FTIR. However,
robusticity is further improved by adding the other methods presented
in this paper. Following this approach, the reference data and techniques presented in this study provide the ﬁrst step towards a toolkit
for the characterisation of archaeological charred bone from various different ages and contexts.
The archaeological record of ﬁre use contains a complex mixture of
both charred and combusted bones, most of which will have been affected by post-depositional processes. This study takes an important
ﬁrst step towards a full understanding of archaeological heated bone
by providing comprehensive baseline data on charred bone, which can
be used for identiﬁcation purposes and determining past heating conditions, as well as aid in reconstructing taphonomic histories. Further research is underway to extend the reference data presented here both
with repeats and blind-tests, as well as to cover the effect of oxygen
on thermal alteration and the inﬂuence of post-depositional processes
on both charred and combusted bone.
