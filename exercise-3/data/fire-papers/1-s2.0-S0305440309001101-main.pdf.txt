The incorporation of plant biomass into soil usually leads to long-chain n-alkanes with a relative
predominance of odd carbon numbered homologues. Contrastingly, an increase in short-chain even
carbon numbered n-alkanes was found in charred biomass with progressing temperatures. We applied
lipid analysis to buried ancient topsoils that contained charred organic matter and to corresponding
control soils, which were characterized by a lighter color and lower contents of charred materials.
Commonly, the proportion of lipid extracts was found to be lower in the ancient soil than in the control
samples, which indicated an enhanced degradation of organic matter, e.g., by thermal degradation. All
samples displayed a particular pattern of short-chain and even carbon numbered n-alkanes (maximum
at n-C16 or n-C18). The ratios CPI (carbon preference index) and ACL (average chain length) for the
investigated soil samples matched the ratios found for maize and rye straw charred at 400  C or 500  C,
respectively. These molecular ratios indicate the presence of charred biomass. The predominance of
short-chain and even carbon numbered n-alkanes was a result of thermal degradation of biomass. The
degradation products were preserved in ancient soils and could be applied as molecular markers in
archaeological or palaeoenvironmental research.

1. Introduction
Geochemical methods are used to measure the changes in soil
inorganic and organic matter over time, either caused by natural
processes or by human impact (e.g., Bull et al., 1999b; Entwistle
et al., 2000; Schuldenrein, 1995). Anthropogenic changes in soil
organic matter composition could result from various activities, e.g.,
clearing of forests or individual agricultural practices like manuring
or burning. Until now, knowledge concerning prehistoric agricultural techniques is strongly limited (Bakels, 1997). The changes in
soil organic matter composition due to agricultural practice could be
considered part of the archaeological record, but the marker
substances that allow the assessment of anthropogenic activities are
diverse and their long-term fate in soil is often unknown (Heron,
2004). The ﬁre-history of a site can be reconstructed by the presence
of macrocharcoal or by applying chemical methods to determine the
amount of charred organic matter in soil samples (e.g., Bird and Cali,
1998; Carcaillet et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2005; Gerlach et al., 2006).
However, burning of grass or herbaceous vegetation does not

produce large amounts of charcoal particles and chemical methods
are rarely applied.
The analysis of lipids in soils became an established application in palaeoenvironmental and archaeological research (Knights
et al., 1983; Pepe and Dizabo, 1989; Evershed, 1993; Bethell et al.,
1994). Soil lipids derive mainly from plants or microorganisms
(Dinel et al., 1990). After their incorporation into the soil matrix,
the primary biogenic lipids are progressively reduced to lipid
moieties that are less susceptible against degradation and yield
the potential to be preserved in sedimentary environments and
soils (Kolattukudy et al., 1976) due to the higher recalcitrance of
degradation products like aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons
(Marschner et al., 2008). Hence, n-alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons are more resistant against microbial decomposition than
lipidic precursor compounds like fatty acids and alcohols
(Kästner, 2000; Nguyen Tu et al., 2001; Galiulin et al., 2002;
Wiesenberg et al., 2004b, 2008). The chain length of n-alkanes is
related to their provenance: odd carbon numbered long-chained
(>C25) alkanes are attributed to higher plants (Eglinton et al.,
1962), while odd carbon numbered short-chained (<C21) alkanes
derive from microbial organisms (Dinel et al., 1990). The distribution patterns of lipidic compounds like n-alkanes may therefore indicate the sources of biomass inputs in soils or sediments

(Jambu et al., 1991; Amblès et al., 1994; Marseille et al., 1999;
Peters et al., 2005). Lipid analysis has been demonstrated to be
a useful tool to detect vegetation or land use changes in soils after
several thousands of years, e.g., to identify the use of grass turfs
to build the Orkney plaggen soils (Bull et al., 1999a), or to follow
the environmental history in lake sediments (Schwark et al.,
2002; Fisher et al., 2003) and in a sequence of palaeosoils (Xie
et al., 2003). During the recent past, a variety of lipid patterns and
compounds have been described to be diagnostic for different
organic materials. They provide the potential to reﬂect soil
management practises in soil organic matter (Pepe and Dizabo,
1989; Bethell et al., 1994; Evershed et al., 1997; Simpson et al.,
1998; Bull et al., 1999a; Wiesenberg and Schwark, 2006).
The thermal degradation of biomass during a ﬁre causes
changes in lipid distribution patterns (González-Vila et al., 2001;
Simoneit, 2002) that differ from microbial degradation during
composting (Dinel et al., 2001; Spaccini and Piccolo, 2007) because
biomass burning induces faster and stronger reactions due to the
high temperatures reached. Wiesenberg et al. (2009) showed that
the distribution patterns of n-alkanes in biomass samples (maize
and rye straw) changed as a function of temperature. During the
charring process, the long-chain n-alkanes were strongly reduced
by heat, which caused short-chain even carbon numbered
n-alkanes with a maximum at n-C18 or n-C16 to dominate in
samples charred at 500  C. Hence, this extraordinary predominance
of short-chain even carbon numbered homologues was found to be
a useful marker for incomplete burning of biomass.
After burning events, either wildﬁres or deliberate burning,
a fraction of the charred organic material left on the soil surface is
incorporated into the soil mineral matrix (Eckmeier et al., 2007).
The lipid distribution patterns in some soils in Spain that were
affected by vegetation burning were dominated by short-chain
even carbon numbered n-alkanes (Tinoco et al., 2006). These
patterns were different from the patterns observed in unburned
biomass but in some cases similar to the composition of soot
(Simoneit, 2002; Oros et al., 2006) and to the results of Wiesenberg
et al. (2009) for charred biomass.
In the present study, we applied lipid analysis to buried ancient
topsoils in NW-Germany that contained charred organic matter.
The 14C-ages of macrocharcoals and black carbon indicated burning
of biomass during Mesolithic to Neolithic periods. The aim of the
study is to investigate if the distribution patterns of n-alkanes
detected in freshly charred biomass or recently burned soils (shortchained and even carbon numbered) are also detectable in ancient
soils after several thousands of years, and if n-alkanes might
therefore be applicable as molecular markers for ﬁre in archaeological or palaeoenvironmental research.
2. Material and methods
Soil samples were collected in the southern Lower Rhine Basin
(NW-Germany) from a gas pipeline trench and from four archaeological excavations within the region. We investigated ancient
dark brown humic soil horizons (relic Anthrosols) that were
distributed as patches (diam. < 100 m) in surrounding Luvisols.
Always connected to the dark soil horizons were anthropogenic
pits that were ﬁlled with the same soil material. The organic matter
found in the investigated dark soils is former topsoil material that
was preserved in the pits or that has been transported down the
soil proﬁle as a result of leaching and clay migration and accumulated in the Bt-horizon.
The pits have regular shapes but never contained visible artefacts. About one-third of the soil organic matter in pit ﬁllings and
soil horizons consisted of charred organic matter, or black carbon.
AMS 14C data of charred organic matter from soil samples selected

1591

for this study (Table 1) indicated the occurrence of ﬁres during
Mesolithic to Neolithic periods (Gerlach et al., 2006; Eckmeier et al.,
2009). The control samples were taken from the soil material
(Bt-horizon of Luvisols) directly next to the pits from an identical
soil depth. Additionally, two settlement pit ﬁllings were sampled in
a clearly deﬁned and archaeologically dated Early Neolithic settlement area. They contained artefacts, mainly settlement waste like
pot-sherds or bones, and charred organic matter.
After drying the soil samples at 40  C, the aggregates were
crushed and coarse material (>2 mm) was removed by dry sieving.
Total carbon concentrations were determined for all soil samples by
dry combustion via an elemental analyzer (Elementar VarioEL).
Lipids were extracted from soil samples (100–120 g) via
a Soxhlet-extractor for 24 h using dichloromethane/methanol (2/1;
v/v). According to Wiesenberg et al. (in press) the total lipid extract
(TLE) was separated into two fractions by elution on a KOH coated
SiO2 column: (i) a neutral fraction and (ii) an acid fraction, containing mainly fatty acids. The neutral lipids were subsequently
separated using the medium-pressure liquid chromatography
separation scheme (MPLC) described by Radke et al. (1980) to gain
the aliphatic hydrocarbons, which were directly amenable for gas
chromatographic analyses. For quantiﬁcation, a deﬁned amount of
d50-n-C24 alkane was added to each sample. Identiﬁcation and
quantiﬁcation of compounds were performed on an Agilent 6890N
gas chromatograph with a diphenyldimethylpolysiloxan-coated
(0.33 mm) silica capillary column (50 m  0.2 mm; J&W DB5),
coupled to an Agilent 5973 mass spectrometer. The initial
temperature was held at 70  C for 3 min after injection, then
ramped to 140  C at 10  C per minute, followed by a temperature
increase of 3  C per minute until 320  C and held constant at 320  C
for 30 min.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Total lipid extracts
Soil lipids usually contribute 20–60 g kg1 to soil organic matter
(Stevenson, 1982). Here, the lipid extract yields, normalized to soil
organic carbon (SOC), varied between 19 and 324 g TLE kg1 SOC.
They exceeded values determined for B-horizons from other loessderived soils in Germany (9–15 g lipid kg1 SOC; Wiesenberg et al.,
2006) and from a Haplic Podzol (4–24 g lipid kg1 SOC; Naafs et al.,
2004). The carbon concentrations were higher in the dark fossil
soils than in the control samples but as shown in Fig. 1, in six of
eight cases (average values; p ¼ 0.128) the proportion of lipid
extracts in SOC was lower in the dark fossil soils.
The age of the organic matter and the low concentrations of SOC
suggest the preferential decomposition of more labile organic
compounds over time, while mainly stable compounds like black
carbon or n-alkanes have been enriched. This would explain the
relatively high proportion of total lipids in our samples. The
reduced microbial activity in acidic soils (van Bergen et al., 1998)
and in buried soils due to limited oxygen access supports the
preservation of lipids, which is a prerequisite for investigating soils
in an archaeological context.
The lower proportion of lipids in the dark fossil soil horizons and
pit ﬁllings might nevertheless indicate an advanced degradation of
lipid compounds relative to the control samples. Otto et al. (2006)
found less extractable lipids in charred soil surface samples than in
the underlying mineral soil material, probably because of the
exposure of the plant litter to higher temperatures. Contrastingly,
burning could also increase the abundance of lipids in soil by
releasing organic compounds from charred biomass, which are
subsequently translocated into the soil (DeBano et al., 1970;
Czimczik et al., 2003). About one-third of the organic matter in the

investigated dark soils is charred (black carbon; Gerlach et al., 2006).
During one or more burning events, the lipid contents of the charred
biomass were most likely reduced. The charred organic matter, now
depleted in lipids, was incorporated into the soil. This causes the
lower lipid yields in the dark soil material, which is in agreement
with the observations made by Wiesenberg et al. (2009), where
charring of biomass resulted in a decrease in lipid contents.
3.2. n-Alkanes
As shown in Fig. 2, all sample sets displayed a particular pattern
of short-chain and even carbon numbered n-alkanes. The distribution patterns of n-alkanes were dominated by a maximum at nC16 or n-C18. Highly abundant in sample set 3 and in the settlement
pits (9, 10) were also n-C20 and n-C22. Sample sets 2 and 4 showed
a high abundance of n-C17, as well as n-C19 in sample set 5. A
predominance of n-C17 and n-C19 was found in sets 5–7. The highest
detectable carbon number in all samples was n-C31. n-C29 and n-C31
were relatively higher abundant than n-C21–28 and n-C30. Sample
set 8 revealed that the pattern of n-alkanes in different depths of

one pit proﬁle was similar. Here, the predominance of even carbon
numbered n-alkanes was not as clear as in the other samples. The
isoprenoid alkanes pristane and phytane, which are frequently
used for source apportionment and as a degradation parameter in
sediments, were present in all samples. Their relative abundance in
comparison to n-C17 and n-C18 alkanes was almost identical in all
samples and showed no distinct differences between and within
the sample sets. Unresolved complex mixtures (UCM) were present
in all samples, but never exceeded thrice the value of the baseline
and were lower than in common recent soils (e.g., Wiesenberg
et al., 2004a) and thus can be neglected.
The incorporation of higher plant biomass into soils usually
leads to long-chain n-alkanes with a relative enrichment of odd
carbon numbered homologues (Rieley et al., 1991; Jandl et al.,
2007). The elevated amount of n-C31 alkanes might indicate the
input of grass or crops (Maffei, 1996), while the n-C29 alkane
would be a signal for the incorporation of grass or woody biomass
(van Bergen et al., 1997). An exception was reported by Jansen
et al. (2006), who showed that mainly root extracts but also leaves
from some Andean plant species contain not only long-chained

n-alkanes but also high amounts of n-C18 and n-C20 alkanes. They
explained the latter with an origin from microbial biomass sitting
on the leaves, which has not been described elsewhere. Traces of
short-chain and even carbon numbered n-alkane homologues
were detected in the corresponding Andean soils, too, but in low
proportions (Jansen et al., 2008). Extracts from rye and maize
roots as well as from farmyard manure (Halle, East-Germany)
yielded high abundances of n-C16 and/or n-C18, but in the soils
under rye or maize cultivation these short-chain n-alkanes were
hardly present (Jandl et al., 2007), and their ﬁndings were not
supported by complementary studies on similar tissues (e.g.,
Wiesenberg et al., 2004b). Xie et al. (2003) found maximum peaks
at n-C16 or n-C18 in palaeosoils but with an odd-over-even
predominance above n-C22. An even-over-odd predominance of nalkane compounds, including n-C16–18 alkanes, was reported by
Love et al. (2005) for products derived from diverse marine and
freshwater microalgae and bacteria species. We can exclude these
species as sources for the pattern found in our soils, as there was
no evidence for water logging or high groundwater tables at the
investigated locations. Furthermore, the n-alkanes of aquatic algae
or bacteria are also dominated by n-C17, a pattern typically found
in lake sediments (Cranwell et al., 1987). The latter was the case in
three of our sample sets (5–7), which, however, were taken from
the same location as sample sets 3 and 4 that do not show
a predominance of n-C17. We are also not aware of the presence of
a higher water table at this location in the past.

An increase in short-chain even carbon numbered n-alkane
homologues was reported for charred biomass (Wiesenberg et al.,
2009), for aerosols produced during the burning of biomass (Oros
et al., 2006), for topsoil material after ﬁre (Almendros et al., 1988;
Tinoco et al., 2006) and for tar layers formed from soil and vegetation during a volcanic eruption on the island of Montserrat (Bull
et al., 2008). The reported patterns are all related to a loss of higher
n-alkane homologues during heating. Wiesenberg et al. (2009)
showed that a decrease in chain length and a decrease in
predominance of odd n-alkanes correlated with progressing charring temperatures or thermal degradation, respectively. They
proposed that a thermal degradation results in a breakdown of wax
n-alkanes at high temperatures (500  C) in combination with
a defunctionalization of precursor compounds resulting in the
predominance of short-chain even carbon numbered n-alkanes. A
transition with increasing temperature was determined: from
primary plant lipid distribution patterns, which could be detected
even at 300  C, to the predominance of mid-chain n-alkanes at
400  C (maximizing at n-C20–24) and ﬁnally towards the predominance of short-chain n-alkanes at 500  C. Only small amounts of
primary long-chain n-alkanes (n-C29–31) were present after charring at high temperatures. When compared to the results obtained
by Wiesenberg et al. (2009a), the distribution pattern of n-alkanes
determined in the dark soils might indicate the incomplete
combustion of non-woody plant material at temperatures between
400 and 500  C, but it should be considered that the exposure time

of biomass to ﬁre and the oxygen availability are also of relevance
and that we could not deduce a ﬁre-temperature of the observed
patterns.
Molecular ratios describe the patterns of n-alkanes measured in
the investigated soil samples and indicate possible lipid sources
(Table 2). Due to the lack of homologues >C31 we chose the
(i) carbon preference index of short-chain alkanes (CPIshort) and the
(ii) average chain length (ACL) to compare our results:
(i) CPIshort ¼ [(C16 þ C18)/(C15 þ C17) þ (C16 þ C18)/

(ii) ACL ¼ (zn  n)/ (zn), with zn as the relative amount of the

The average CPIshort of dark fossil soil material (3.3) and control
(2.7) samples match the ratios Wiesenberg et al. (2009) found for
maize and rye straw charred at 500  C, while the average ACL of pit

(20.8) and control (20.7) samples ﬁt to results for straw charred at
400  C (maize), or lies between 400  C and 500  C (rye), as shown
in Fig. 3. These molecular ratios indicate the presence of charred
biomass in the soil samples, i.e. the n-alkane patterns are most
likely a result of thermal degradation.
The presence of the even-over-odd distribution of n-alkanes in
the control samples is a problematic aspect. We suggest that this
could be a result of translocation from lipid material from the
adjacent dark soil material, as the control samples had to be taken
less than 50 cm away from the pits. It is unlikely that lipids from
former burnt topsoil material leached down the proﬁle because
then we would have found other charred biomass materials.
Additionally, a thermal alteration of material surrounding the pits
cannot be excluded if the biomass burning occurred within the pits
or if the pits were ﬁlled with hot residues of burned biomass.
The comparison of different sample sets indicated that the
results reveal the same trend, but that some variations occur

between the locations. It is unlikely that all sites have the same ﬁrehistory and history of landscape management. In addition, different
amounts of charred biomass from various sources (grass or wood)
might have been incorporated into the soil at different sites. The
similar shape of the pits does not indicate that they had the same
purpose or function. While recent soils are characterized by a low
recalcitrance of organic matter (Marschner et al., 2008), we can
assume that organic material preserved in buried soils and other
terrestrial sedimentary environments yields potential to be
preserved for several millennia as demonstrated for n-alkanes in
buried soils (Zech, 2006) and in peaty soils (Bol et al., 1996).
However, a modiﬁcation of lipid distribution patterns in individual
pits might have occurred over time, resulting in some differences of
lipid distribution pattern between the sites.
4. Conclusions
Lipid distribution patterns from soil material containing charred
organic matter of Mesolithic to Neolithic age showed a predominance of short-chain and even carbon numbered n-alkanes, maximizing at n-C16 or n-C18. This exceptional distribution pattern can
be attributed to thermal degradation or incomplete combustion of
preferentially non-woody biomass occurring most likely at
temperatures between 400 and 500  C. The pattern of small
amounts of plant derived long-chain n-alkanes and relatively large
amounts of short-chain n-alkanes derived from biomass burning
has been preserved for several thousands of years and therefore
yields high potential to be an adequate parameter to determine
biomass sources as well as burning of biomass in buried soils.
Archaeological research could beneﬁt from this analytical tool in
terms of determining the land use history or ancient agricultural
practice. The reconstruction of biomass burning relies either on the
preservation of macrocharcoals or chemical analyses. The n-alkane
patterns could give evidence for ﬁre events independently from the
occurrence of charcoal in soils.
