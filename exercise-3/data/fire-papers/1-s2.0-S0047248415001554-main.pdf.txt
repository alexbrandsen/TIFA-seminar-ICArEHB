Thermoluminescence (TL) data are presented for eight samples of heated ﬂint collected at the archae€ ningen 13/I-1 (Cycle I), for which a Holsteinian age is suggested by palynology of
ological site of Scho
stratigraphically similar positions within a cyclic sedimentological model for the Quaternary sequence of
€ ningen. Although the ﬁre responsible for the zeroing of the TL-signal cannot be unequivocally
Scho
attributed to human activities, any time difference between a natural ﬁre and the human occupation is
negligible for a site of this antiquity. The weighted mean age of 321 ± 16 ka places the last heating of the
ﬂints nominally in the age range of Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 10 to 8. By inference this data would
suggest an attribution of the Holsteinian to MIS 9 and may also serve as a maximum age estimate for the
€ ningen 13/II-4 (Cycle II). Considering the chronometric data available and following an
spear site of Scho
€ningen can be considered as
alternative sedimentological model the age of these two sites at Scho
belonging to the same climatic cycle. This suggests an attribution to MIS 9, and by inference provides an
age estimate of 337e300 ka for the oldest spears in human history.

1. Introduction
Chronostratigraphy, for which stratigraphic information is
combined with age estimates (Richter, 2015), provides the ultimate framework for the interpretation of human evolution, human behavior, and geological processes of the past. While relative
age information is sufﬁcient as a ﬁrst approximation, chronostratigraphical information on a deﬁned time scale and/or with
ﬁxed points in time is necessary to understand sequences of
€ningen, with its relatively
processes. The Quaternary site of Scho
large number of sites and large scale excavations, is situated
within a long sedimentary sequence, which reﬂects environmental changes and thus provides a unique opportunity to
investigate hominin land use. The interpretation of climate and
landscape change, and how these factors inﬂuence hominin
behavior, requires speciﬁc knowledge of the time depth involved
in such processes. However, the data necessary for placing the

Krbetschek, 2012; Sierralta et al., 2012; Urban and Sierralta,

the northern foreland of the Harz Mountains and at the southeastern edge of the Triassic limestone ridge called the Elm

The preservation of such a long Middle Pleistocene to Holocene

repeating ice advances at various times. Sediments deposited under
warm climatological conditions alternate with evidence of glacia€nen) of the major advances during Elsterian and

Since 1983, archaeological excavations have been conducted in

plant remains, wood, small and large fauna, molluscs, ﬁsh, amphibians, and insects (Thieme, 2007b).

differences in these types of records, correlations are not straightforward. The recent stacking of oxygen isotope data developed by
Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) functions as a representative model of
approximate age estimates for marine isotope stages (MIS) and
provides ages of 424e374 ka for MIS 11, 337e300 ka for MIS 9,
243e191 ka for MIS 7, and 130 to ~116 ka for MIS 5e (Table 1).
However, differences between the marine and the terrestrial record
are known (e.g., the base of the last interglacial [Eemian] appears to
be about 6 ka younger than the base of MIS 5; Shackleton et al.,
2003; Sier et al., 2011), and therefore such marine frameworks
can only serve as references.

Holsteinian interglacial in the isotope chronostratigraphies (MIS 9
or MIS 11), a topic which is hotly debated (e.g., Desprat et al., 2005;
Geyh and Müller, 2006; Nitychoruk et al., 2006; Koutsodendris,
2011; Geyh and Krbetschek, 2012; Stephan et al., 2012). Notable
€ningen and also
differences in the pollen assemblages within Scho
in comparisons with other stratigraphies do not appear to be a
unique feature because differences in pollen sequences attributed
to the Holsteinian are recorded elsewhere (e.g., De Beaulieu et al.,
2001). The differing views on the attribution of pollen assemblages to the Holsteinian may derive from the interpretation and
deﬁnition of pollen data, and hence the unequivocal attribution to a
single pollen stage. Given the recent observations on variations
within Holsteinian pollen sequences (Koutsodendris et al., 2010,
2011) and sediments it appears that the palynological record is
complex and that changes in climate might have produced several
similar pollen assemblages in the time range in question. Regional
variation and/or differential preservation also complicate matters.
However, isotope signals appear to provide a possible basis for the
inclusion of several interglacial-like events in the time range of MIS
11 and 9. Chronometric dating of sequences, or, as is the case here,
of single speciﬁc entities within sequences, helps to establish
chronostratigraphic frameworks and answer questions about the
age of speciﬁc sites.
2.3. The palynological biostratigraphic models
€ningen
A biostratigraphical model of the formation of the Scho
sediments (Urban et al., 1988, 2011, 2015; Urban, 1995b, 2007a;
Urban and Sierralta, 2012) is mainly based on palynological investigations providing a relative chronological sequence within a
series of sedimentological cycles (Table 1). Liminic-telmatic sediments in adepression of Elsterian age were attributed to the late
Holsteinian and early Saalian glaciation in the northern part of the
€ningen mine, unconformable located above erosional interScho
glacial Holsteinian gravels (Urban et al., 1991a). From the same area,
a series of peat is unconformable overlain by Saalian moraines
(Drenthe-Stadial) and attributed to a post-Holsteinian interglacial,
€ ningen Interglacial (Urban et al., 1991a;
locally known as Scho
Urban, 1995b, 2007a). Urban (2007a) describes parallels to the
€mnitz or Wacken interglacials, while Litt et al. (2007) favors the
Do
€mnitz interglacial (Table 1). The Scho
€ningen Interglacial is bioDo
stratigraphically located above the Holsteinian interglacial and
therefore might correlate with Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 7 (Urban,
2007a). In the southern part of the mine an additional interglacial
was identiﬁed and named Reinsdorf, being palynologically distinct
€ningen Interfrom the Holsteinian Interglacial as well as the Scho
glacial, and located stratigraphically lower from the latter (Urban
et al., 1991b; Urban, 1995a,b, 1999, 2007a). While Urban (2007a)
€ningen Interglacials as part of the
regards the Reinsdorf and Scho
Saalian complex sensu lato, Litt et al. (2007) interpret the Reinsdorf
as part of the Holsteinian (Table 1), which corresponds to its lithostratigraphical position (Urban et al., 2011). The Eemian inter€ ningen by its later
glacial is palynologically represented at Scho
phases, and early Weichselian Interstadials are present as well
(Urban, 1995a).
The mammalian biostratigraphy (Van Kolfschoten, 2012, 2014)
indirectly conﬁrms the attribution of the glacial sediments to the
Elsterian and Saalian. The mammals from the deposits lying
directly above the Elsterian (Holsteinian according to palynology,
cycle I or channel I in a sedimentological model described below)
are not discriminating for either exclusive glacial or interglacial
conditions. The following package of sediments (Reinsdorf/cycle
II/channel II) contains species younger than Boxgrove, Miesenheim I, Mauer, or Mosbach, but which are older than Maasd e
re or Weimar-Ehringsdorf. A correlation with
tricht-Belve

British fauna attributed to MIS 9 is considered as more plausible,
especially as the water voles do not match the British (MIS 11)
Holsteinian (Van Kolfschoten, 2014).
2.4. The sedimentological chronostratigraphic models
While the attributions of the glacial sediments to the Elsterian
and Saalian glaciations appear to be unequivocal, several
competing sedimentological models attempt to explain the depositional history of the observed sequences (Table 1). The lens shaped interglacial sediments were interpreted as ﬁllings of kettle
holes (Elsner, 1987), tectono-climatologically driven channels
reﬂecting the glacial series (Mania, 1995, 2006), or as river delta/
lake deposits in a tunnel-valley (Lang and Winsemann, 2012; Lang
et al., 2012, 2015).
According to Mania (1995, 2006), six major channels formed
due to ﬂuvial erosion during late glacials and due to subrosion
during the subsequent interglacial (Table 1). Formation occurred
parallel to the Ofﬂeben salt dome, which caused a shifting of the
channel positions due to its uprising and subsequently resulted in
partial overlap of channels (Mania, 1995). The channels are
€ningen IeVI from old to younger (from West to
numbered Scho
East) and correspond to the cycles in Urban (2007a,b). They
unconformable overlie the Elsterian glacial deposits. The model is
linked to the biostratigraphical interpretation of the sequence by
invoking climatological (glacial) cycles as cause of channel formation (Mania, 1995). This provides a more or less ﬁxed time
frame within a hemispheric system but also requires a good match
of observed erosion and cyclic patterns with this system, which
are not always warranted. The interglacial ﬁllings of channel I
(Holsteinian), channel II (Reinsdorf Interglacial), and channel III
€ningen Interglacial) consist of ﬁne-grained organogenic
(Scho
sediments and peat (Mania, 1995, 2006; Urban, 1995a, 2007a).
Channel IV is located above the Saalian glacial deposits, and its
ﬁlling consists of redeposited loess with paleosoils, which are
interpreted as periglacial formations, occurring between Drenthe
and Warthe interstadials (Urban, 2007a). The uncomformable
overlying channel V is ﬁlled with weakly consolidated secondary
carbonates, peat, and soils, which are placed in the Eemian
Interglacial, and followed by 6 m loess deposits in which the Late
Glacial/Holocene channel VI is cut in (Urban, 1995a, 2007a,b;
Mania, 2006). Correlations with the sedimentary sequence of the
Ascherslebener See (Mania, 1967), the travertine terraces of Bilzingsleben (Mania, 1999; Mania and Mania, 2005), and the site of
Neumark-Nord (Mania, 1996, 2004; Mania and Mania, 2008)
provide a climato-stratigraphical framework within the OIS system (Mania, 2006).
A contrasting model (Table 1) explains the interglacial sedi€ ningen as a river-delta system, where the
mentation at Scho
observed cyclic drying (Verlandungsfolgen) as well as the unconformable overlapping structures are related to lake level changes
and a delta sedimentation at the crossroad of a lake and the mouth
of a river (Lang and Winsemann, 2012, Lang et al., 2012, 2015).
€ningen is located in
According to this model, the succession at Scho
the sediment trap of a tunnel valley, and the interglacial sediments
consist of lateral and vertical stacks of lacustrine deltaic deposits.
While the observed large scale changes in sea levels are linked to
climate change (Lang and Winsemann, 2012) the causality of
observed sedimentology to changes in climate is negated and
rather related to the nature of depositional regimes of ﬂuvial deltas
and lake level changes (Lang and Winsemann, 2012). However,
there are no indications as to why climate changes should invoke
only major lake level changes. The palynological evidence, however, demonstrates that major changes took place at these particular times. The inherent variability of delta sedimentation

D. Richter, M. Krbetschek / Journal of Human Evolution 89 (2015) 46e56

precludes any correlation with chronostratigraphy, except the
evidenced glacial deposits of the Elsterian and Saalian glaciations.
The model by Lang and Winsemann (2012) does not require
climatological driven changes, and hence allows for short time
spans between stratigraphical units. But it neither contradicts the
palynological model.
Both sedimentological models require considerable ﬂuvial activity, for which there is currently little evidence, as the present day
creek ‘Missaue’ is rather small and it is questionable whether it was
ever large enough for such a degree of activity.
2.5. Chronostratigraphy and numerical ages
The different views, interpretations, and models for the
€ ningen sequence lead to rather different age estimates
Scho
(Table 1). Neither model can be entirely refuted, and numerical
dating is required for falsiﬁcation of models or the attribution of
sedimentological layers or units to marine isotope stages (MIS) or
any other reference. At present, only a few numerical ages are
available for the sequence. The majority are 230Th/U-disequilibrium
dates on peat. While Ueseries ages in general have to be checked
and corrected for detrital Th, U-series dates on peat must be viewed
with caution because peat is an open system. The presence of a
plateau age for several U-series age determinations along the
proﬁle of the center of a thick layer of peat might indicate quasiclosed system behavior and ages therefore considered as more
reliable (Geyh, 2008).
€ningen sequence was attempted
The ﬁrst dating of the Scho
with alphaspectrometric 230Th/U-dating, which resulted in un€ningen Interglacial (channel/
corrected dates on peat from the Scho
cycle III) of 180 and 227 ka (data from Sierralta et al., 2012), later
assigned to 320 ka (Heijnis and Urban, 1995), and should be
viewed with caution. In a more recent study with Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (TIMS), open system behavior was
detected for most samples (Urban et al., 2011; Sierralta et al.,
2012). No age results are therefore given for these samples, but
the ages for the uppermost ﬁve samples from the lower peat at
€ ningen 13/II (Reinsdorf interglacial, cycle II, level 2c5.2a) were
Scho
considered to be reliable. A weighted mean (n ¼ 5 @ 2s) of corrected ages of 294 ± 5 ka (Urban et al., 2011) was considered as
300 ± 18 ka in Urban et al. (2011) and a weighted mean (n ¼ 4 @
2s) of corrected ages of 290 ± 5 ka for apparently the same
samples was given in Sierralta et al. (2012). Inconsistencies in
these data sets require a re-analysis before ﬁnal conclusions are
drawn (M. Geyh, pers. comm. 2013), but it appears that the peat,
€ningen 13/I-4,
and by inference the spears from the overlying Scho
are around 300 ka in age.
There are few alternatives to date the sequence because of the
lack of datable material, (e.g., neither tephra for 39Ar/40Ar dating,
nor secondary carbonates for U-series), and it appears that only
dosimetric dating methods (luminescence and Electron Spin
Resonance) are suitable. A thermoluminescence (TL) estimate of
the last heating of a single piece of ﬂint from the archaeological site
€ningen 13/I-1 (channel/cycle I, layer 1) gave an age of
of Scho
470 ± 60 ka (Richter and Thieme, 2012). Such singular dating is not
providing a precise and good age estimate (Richter, 2007).
Furthermore, the reanalysis of this data revealed an analytical
inconsistency in the calculated proportional alpha dose-rate being
larger than the respective iteratively (Mercier, 1991) calculated
alpha induced TL. This should not be the case because TL-signal
growth with aeradiation is linear over the entire datable age
range, in contrast to the signal from b or g radiation (Mercier, 1992).
This unexplained contradiction in the analysis, which was not
observed in the data presented here, has to lead to the rejection of
this age estimate.

2.6. The Paleolithic site of Scho
Palaeolithic remains occur throughout the Pleistocene stratig€ningen, either in isolation or in association with
raphy at Scho
€ ningen are
faunal remains. All of the major Paleolithic sites at Scho
stratigraphically located between the Elsterian deposits and the
Saalian till (Thieme, 2007a; Serangeli et al., 2012). Many of those
provide excellent preservation of wood remains, which are sometimes modiﬁed (Thieme, 1999), including the famous spears from
€ningen 13/II-4 (Thieme, 1997; where the ﬁrst arabic number in
Scho
the site denomination refers to an area, the roman number to the
channel/cycle, and the last arabic number to sediment layers
within).
€ ningen is labeled as
The oldest archaeological site at Scho
€ningen 13/I-1 and is stratigraphically located above Elsterian
Scho
deposits. It is attributed to the earliest part of the Holsteinian
complex because of its location in sediments of the channel I system (Thieme, 2007b). Two different strata were excavated, with the
€ ningen 13/I-2) containing faunal remains only
upper one (Scho
€ningen 13/I-1)
(mainly bison) and only the lower one (Scho
providing archaeological material, which was embedded in and on
top of a gravel deposit. This sediment contains abundant pieces of
ﬂint, which were transported by glacial activities from the Baltic
Sea, many of which are frost shattered. Separation of artefact from
natural material is thus difﬁcult (e.g., Pasda, 2012), especially as the
€ ningen 13/I-1 are not very diagnostic and
ﬂint artefacts from Scho
consist mostly of small ﬂakes and some notched ﬂake tools, which
are considered to be Lower Paleolithic from a technological and
typological perspective (Richter and Thieme, 2012). Some ﬂints
exhibit macroscopic signs of severe heating to high temperature
like potlids, crazing, and craquelation. However, such macroscopic
features could be attributed to weathering as well (e.g., Richter,
2007). Large faunal remains of proboscidaea, Equus mosbachensis
cf, Bos primigenius, Bos/Bison and Cervus elaphus suggest an open
landscape (Thieme, 2007b; van Kolfschoten, 2012, 2014).
€ningen 13/I-1 is the stratigraphically lowermost site at
Scho
€ningen, and, regardless of the chronostratigraphical model,
Scho
one of the oldest Paleolithic sites in Germany. Establishing its age is
therefore important not only for pinpointing the stratigraphical
sequence but also for providing an age estimate for the archaeology
and, ultimately, a maximum age for the overlying spear horizon of
€ningen 13/II-4.
Scho
3. Thermoluminescence dating
Here we present thermoluminescence dating results on eight
€ ningen 13/I-1 to help establish the age of
heated ﬂints from Scho
this stratigraphically important site. While chronometric information is needed for the geological stratigraphy, and hence placing the
archaeology in a chronostratigraphic context, it is also desirable to
obtain dates for prehistoric events which can be related to human
activities, like lighting of a ﬁre which caused damage to ﬂint.
However, unequivocal attribution to human activities can be made
only on the basis of evident, and sometimes latent (e.g., AlpersonAﬁl et al., 2007), structures. The analysis of the site is ongoing and
no speciﬁc spatial patterns or evident structures were observed
during the excavation (H. Thieme, pers. comm.). The thermal alterations of ﬂints from the ﬁnd layer could therefore have been due
to either past human activities, or the heating could have been
caused by a natural ﬁre. However, if a natural ﬁre was the cause, we
would expect to see a large quantity of ﬂints with traces of ﬁre, not
just a fraction. The nature of the deposit (sandy/gravel) and its
location at a lake shore are not consistent with environments being
frequently exposed to ﬁre, and the occurrence of a natural ﬁre is
therefore unlikely, especially as sediment penetration depths of

50

D. Richter, M. Krbetschek / Journal of Human Evolution 89 (2015) 46e56

natural ﬁres are low (e.g. Richter, 2007). In any case, the time difference between a natural and an anthropogenic ﬁre and/or occupation seems to be negligible for a site of this antiquity because
neither artefacts nor natural pieces show signs of prolonged surface
exposure. In fact, both ﬁnd categories have relatively sharp edges
(H. Thieme, pers. comm.) and therefore any time difference between deposition and heating, if present, must have been
negligible.
3.1. Principle of thermoluminescence dating
Thermoluminescence (TL) dating of heated ﬂint artefacts is a
well-established method for dating Middle Paleolithic archaeological sites (e.g., Valladas et al., 1988; Mercier et al., 1991; Richter
et al., 2010b). In contrast to many other methods, the age of a
past human activity d the lighting of a ﬁre d can be directly
determined using TL dating.
In a simpliﬁed model, TL dating is based on the accumulation of
electrons in excited states in the crystal lattice caused by omnipresent ionizing radiation. The resulting metastable states are
quantitatively measured by thermoluminescence analysis and
provide the radiation dose the sample has received since the last
zeroing (heating, i.e. ﬁre), when excited states were all eliminated
before accumulation to the present state. Only such metastable
stages are considered, which have a life-time of at least an order of
magnitude longer than the age to be determined. If the rates of all
ionizing radiation sources (dose-rate) at the sample position are
known, an age can be calculated by dividing the radiation dose by
the radiation dose-rate.
Dosimetric dating presumes constant dose-rates over the entire
burial time. In ﬂint TL dating, dose-rates are comprised of internal
(a and b) radiation from the inner part of a sample, which is
considered stable, and external (g and cosmic) dose-rates, where
the g-component might have varied through time (e.g., Richter,
2007). The stability of the internal dose-rates is not contested
over the time range of interest because all parts of the sample are
discarded that show macroscopical traces of geochemical alterations d like patination d which could indicate changes in isotopic
composition. Spatially clustered distributions of radioelements can
lead to inhomogeneous dosimetric ﬁelds within solid samples (hot
spots), which results in erroneous ages if not corrected for (e.g.,
Tribolo et al., 2006). However, variations of magnitudes signiﬁcant
for age determination appear to be linked to visible zonations in
ﬂint (Schmidt et al., 2013) and thus can be easily detected and
discarded from analysis.
The constancy of the external g-dose-rate from the surrounding
sediment can be veriﬁed for the recent past (e.g., by High Purity
Germanium [HpGe] g-ray spectrometry), but ancient (repeated)
occurrences of disturbances (disequilibria) between the members
of the uranium decay chain, which give rise to the g-dose-rate,
cannot be excluded by such analysis. However, the failure to detect
disequilibrium by HpGe g-ray spectrometry is usually interpreted
as an indication that the decay chains have always been in secular
equilibrium, and the external g-dose-rate is thus assumed to have
been stable over the entire burial period.
HpGe g-ray spectrometry does allow the analysis of only the
small particles of sediments, but sediment layers in archaeological
sites often contain larger pieces of rocks. HpGe g-ray spectrometry
on sediment samples in the laboratory may therefore not be
representative of the actual radiation conditions at the sampling
spot (Schwarcz, 1994). Therefore the external g-dose of such
‘lumpy’ sites is preferentially measured with dosemeters buried at
least 30 cm deep into the proﬁles (Richter, 2007).
Flint samples are removed from their context by excavation,
and the external g-dose-rate therefore cannot be measured at the

sample's exact position. Therefore measurements in positions
considered as representative of the samples' immediate environment (geometry within a sphere of ~60 cm diameter) have to
be taken. In order to estimate the external g-dose, several positions next to the samples' locations are measured and the average
result is used for the age calculation. As a result of this approach,
the g-dose-rate used for the age calculation is not necessarily
identical to the g-dose-rate the sample was actually exposed to
during burial. Therefore, the resulting individual TL ages may be
too young or too old, which leads to an increased variation in age
results because a mean external g-dose-rate for all the samples
has to be used. This also explains the large variability of TL age
results often observed for a given layer, which is a priori assumed
to represent a more or less single event of a time length that
cannot be resolved by the chronometric dating method. However,
the positions for dosemeters are chosen quasi-randomly and
their individual geometries are unknown because they are
inserted 30 cm deep into the sediment proﬁles. This applies to
the independently and randomly chosen ﬂint samples for dating
as well. A precise and reliable TL age can be obtained only from a
large number of samples and where the average external g-doserate was obtained with a large number of dosemeters. This implies an assumption that the heating took place within a
reasonably short time interval or at the same time for all samples.
The latter is generally assumed for Paleolithic sites, which
commonly represent palimpsests that accumulated in time periods too short to be of signiﬁcant relevance for the interpretation. It is therefore necessary to date several samples from a
Paleolithic layer with TL to provide a good age estimate of the last
heating and thus the occupation of a site. Alternatively, the
dosimetric environment can be reconstructed for individual

3.2. Sample preparation and dosimetry at Scho
Heated ﬂint samples were identiﬁed by macroscopic inspection
€ningen 13/I-1 by H. Thieme, using the
of the inventory of Scho
criteria described in Richter (2007), and samples were prepared
accordingly (see Supplementary Online Material [SOM] for details).
For the external dose only the g-component needs to be taken
into account in heated ﬂint TL-dating, because the sample was
stripped of the parts affected by a and b radiation from the sediment. The preservation of organic material suggests that most of
€ningen was located below the water table for
the sequence of Scho
most of its burial time. Water reduces the g-dose-rate (attenuation)
signiﬁcantly. Therefore, any dosimetric measurement of the sediments needs to be corrected for complete water saturation of the
sediments, and the water capacity of the sediment has to be estimated in order to determine the effective external g-dose-rate.
Several sediment samples in steel tubes of about 10 cm in diameter
and 20 cm in length were taken from the proﬁles to measure the
sediment moisture. The tubes, which were completely ﬁlled with
sediment, were slowly ﬁlled up with water during the course of one
day, the surplus water removed and then weighed. After several
weeks of storage at 70  C the dry weights were determined and the
ratios of the weights provided the water saturation content after
subtraction of the weight of the steel tubes (Table 2). Results were
similar for the various samples, and water saturation was only
slightly higher than the moisture at sampling. The present day ‘as
is’ g-doses as measured in situ by portable g-ray spectrometry or
dosemeters (or in the laboratory by HpGe g-ray spectrometry of
dried sediment material; SOM Table 1) were corrected for the

The g-dose-rate results from the a-Al2O3:C dosemeters are given
in Table 3 (two additional ones were lost and one failed the
analysis).
The mining activities lowered the water table and the sediments
are therefore not water saturated any more. To correct for water
saturation conditions, which prevailed for almost the entire burial
time, average factors from Table 2 were employed for dose-rates in
age calculation (Table 3).
The internal dose-rate of the ﬂint samples may have been
affected by water saturation, given their location in a watersaturated environment. Therefore, the water saturation of three
geological, and therefore certainly unheated, ﬂint samples from
similar geological origin was experimentally determined by immersion in water for one month.
The internal dose-rates were calculated from the speciﬁc activities of the radioisotopes (U, Th, and K) of the ﬂint samples
(Table 4; SOM).

appropriate water saturation conditions (Table 2). Correction followed (Aitken, 1985) and not (Aitken and Xie, 1990) because the
external g-dose has to be corrected for the size and shape of the
ﬂint sample (effective external g-dose-rate after Valladas, 1985).
The in situ g-dose-rate was measured in the ﬁeld with two
portable g-ray spectrometers, both equipped with NaI crystals of
different sizes. The Target NanoSpec has multi-channel capabilities,
while the Harwell spectrometer can discriminate only four channels. The latter instrument therefore provides less resolution and is
more prone to temperature-dependent drift.
More reliable results for g-dose-rates of heterogeneous sediments can be obtained by dosemeters, which were placed into the
sediment body for one year. The accuracy of using this type of
material and this method was recently demonstrated by Richter
et al. (2010a). A total of ten a-Al2O3:C dosemeters were implanted in sediment proﬁles at depths of about 40 cm in order to
compensate for the sloping proﬁles and obtain a 4p-geometry.

3.3. Thermoluminescence measurements
Seventeen ﬂint samples with macroscopic signs of heating
(Richter, 2007), mostly originating from the screening of the
sediments and sampling for dosimetry, were available for TL
analysis. The exterior as well as the interior material (after
removal of the outer 2 mm rim) of each ﬂint sample were investigated by the TL heating plateau test after (Aitken, 1985) to
determine if the prehistoric heating was sufﬁcient to fully erase
the TL signal to allow dating analysis (Table 4). For the heating
plateau test (Aitken, 1985) the TL signal is increased by an additional irradiation in the laboratory, and a constant ratio to the
natural TL signal (heating plateau) over the peak temperature
range between 350 and 390  C (Fig. 1) provides evidence for the
past full erasure of the TL signal. Only ten samples passed both
tests and were therefore sufﬁciently heated for TL-dating analysis,
but two of these were too small for the method employed here
(see SOM for measurement details).
Because the luminescence signal of the samples is close to the
onset of saturation, a technique similar to the ‘Australian Slide
Method’ (Prescott et al., 1993) was employed to determine the dose
the samples received since their prehistoric heating. This paleodose
was obtained by a multi-aliquot-additive-regeneration (MAAR)
slide protocol (Valladas and Gillot, 1978; Mercier, 1991, 1992) on the
90e160 mm grain size fraction. In this protocol the additive and
regenerated TL data are approximated by an exponential function
(Fig. 2). While the mathematical function does not correspond to
the physical processes, it is a sufﬁcient approximation to describe
the TL growth curves (signal increase as a function of dose) and was
found to be empirically more appropriate compared to quadratic
functions, which showed a lesser degree of homoth
etie (or similarity, see below).

Figure 2. TL growth curves (exponential ﬁt) of additive (alpha contribution subtracted; hatched line), regeneration (dark gray line), and shifted (light gray line) regeneration
(scaled) TL-growth curves of the ﬂint sample Schon-13. The constant TL-ratios (polygon) of the additive to shifted regeneration growth curve for the additive dose points is a
measure of the similarity (‘homothetie’) of the two growth curves (Mercier, 1991). Glow curves were aligned to natural peak temperature prior to analysis.

The regeneration TL growth curve is subsequently scaled
(following Sanzelle et al., 1996) and shifted along the dose axis until
the best ﬁt with the additive growth curve is obtained, which is
deﬁned as the minimized variation of the ratio of the growth curves
within the measured dose ranges. A constant ratio of the additive
TL-signal to the TL-signal of the shifted regenerated TL growth
curve is a measure of the similarity (homoth
etie) of the two dose
response curves and is used as a veriﬁcation of the appropriateness
of the slide approach (after Mercier, 1991). The shift is the paleodose (Table 4), and TL-age estimates (Table 5) are calculated
following Aitken (1985).

surprisingly, the laboratory HpGe g-ray spectrometry on dry sediment provided the largest dose-rates (dry 1051 mGy a1 and watersaturation corrected 872 mGy a1) because it does not take into
account neither the contribution of the larger sediment components (gravel and small boulders) nor the sediment layers above
and below the ﬁnd horizon. The result is therefore not representative of the actual g-dose-rate for the samples. The in-situ doserates measured with the portable equipment are considerably
lower and yet still differ to some degree as well (Table 3). However,
as they were recorded in different years, in different seasons, and in
different positions, some variation is to be expected. The results of
the Nutmaq-Harwell are considered to be less reliable than those of
the NanoSpec due to the lower resolution and potential temperature drift problems of the former.
The g-dose-rates measured by the dosemeters are considered to
be the most reliable measurement of the external g-dose-rate
because they provide data for different geometries of the g-doserate, which are caused by differences in gravel content within the
layer and by its varying thickness, as well as differences in the
gamma dose-rate from the adjacent layers. The water saturation
corrected average value of 678 mGy a1 (Table 3), which was used in
age calculation, lies within the range of the results of the portable
equipment. As expected for such ‘lumpy’ sediment, some variation
(sd 14%) is observed (Table 3) and accordingly an uncertainty of 15%
was employed for age calculation.
The water saturation of the geological ﬂint samples was determined as <0.01%weight. While heated ﬂint is probably more porous
compared to unheated ﬂint, it is assumed that the attenuation of
ionizing radiation by additional water within the sample is neglirin et al.
gible. The internal dose-rates were calculated after Gue
(2011) from the speciﬁc radioisotope concentrations of the ﬂint
samples (Table 4), which were obtained by neutron activation
analysis (NAA), and accounting for each sample's sensitivity to aradiation (Table 4).
The cosmic dose-rate of 82 mGy a1 (57 78 445 N, 44 30 825 E at
108 m a.s.l. after Serangeli et al., 2012) was calculated with the
software ‘KosmDL’ (P. Karelin, 1997 using data from Prescott and
Stephan (1982), Barbouti and Rastin (1983), and Prescott and
Hutton [1994]) for a sediment cover of 15 m prior to excavation
(Thieme and Maier, 1995), which is assumed to have accumulated
constantly after burial of the sample. However, the TL-age results
are not signiﬁcantly 2-s affected for varying sediment overburden
between 10 and 50 m.

4.2. Thermoluminescence measurement results and TL-ages
The samples show good heating plateaus of lengths between 30
and 85 K, and the natural TL-peak occurs at temperatures between
355 and 375  C at a heating rate of 5 K s1 (Table 4). The paleodoses
exhibit a large range (Table 4), which is a direct consequence of the

53

differences in radioelement concentrations. Alpha sensitivities are
in the expected range, except sample SCHON-3, which has an unusually low value (Table 4). However, the calculated age of this
sample almost equals the average from all samples (Table 5). This is
also the case for the sample exhibiting the highest concentration in
uranium (SCHON-10), which, as a consequence, exhibits the largest
paleodose. The sample with one of the lowest content in uranium
(SCHON-13) has, as expected, a relatively old age (Tables 4 and 5),
but an age of similar antiquity is also obtained for SCHON-111,
which has higher radionuclide concentrations. The sample with
the second largest dependency on the external gamma dose-rate,
which might be expected to be more prone to variation in gdose-rate, provides an age close to the overall average. All this indicates that the external dose-rate estimate is appropriate, and we
conclude that there are no apparent systematic trends in the data.
Within the limitations of the methods used, the data therefore
provide reliable age estimates (Table 5).
The TL-ages, presented in Table 5 at 1-s, show some variability
between 302 ± 37 ka and 365 ± 46 ka. The calculated ages are
rather dependant on the external g-dose-rate, which contributes
between 49 and 84% of the total dose-rate, and the internal dose,
which is considered stable over burial time, accounts for only
5e43%. The sample with the lowest proportional contribution of
the external g-dose-rate (SCHON-10) could be considered to be the
most reliable (Richter, 2007) because this parameter is the least
well known and could have undergone ﬂuctuations. For sample
SCHON-14 the external g-dose-rate is responsible for 78% of the
total dose-rate, and the age is therefore highly dependent on the
external dose-rate estimate. The age of 313 ± 41 ka, however, is
almost identical to the mean from all samples and close to the most
reliable age from SCHON-10. This might again indicate a good
approximation of the external dose-rate and that the TL-dating
overall appears appropriate.
Statistical tests after Dixon (after Rorabacher, 1991) and Grubbs
(Grubbs, 1969) show the absence of outliers. The data set belongs to
a normal distribution which was tested by passing the ShapiroWilk-Test (software package Origin 8) and a Chi-square test.
Therefore, a weighted average of 321 ± 16 ka (including the systematic uncertainties twice [after Sachs, (1992)]) was calculated as
the best age estimate for the last heating of these samples under
the assumption that the heating took place at the same time or
within the limits of the method.
5. Discussion and conclusions
At a level of 95% probability the weighted TL age of 321 ± 16 ka
€ ningen 13/I-1,
provides an age range of 353 to 289 ka for Scho
which nominally comprises marine isotope stages (MIS) 10 to MIS
8 (MIS after Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). The pollen and sediment at
stratigraphically similar locations in channel I within the channel
system of Mania (1995, 2006) appear to indicate the onset of an
interglacial climate, which is interpreted as Holsteinian (Urban
et al., 1991a). This is in accordance with the mammalian record,
where no species unequivocally attributable to either glacial or
interglacial conditions were recovered from this cycle, but the
€ningen
same mammals occur in the following interglacial at Scho
(Van Kolfschoten, 2014). Despite the mammals in summary indicating non-glacial conditions (Van Kolfschoten, 2014), it does not

Within the TL-dating age range a nominal correlation to an
interglacial is possible only for MIS 9. Under the assumption that
the attribution of this sediment to the Holsteinian is correct, MIS 9
has to be assigned to the Holsteinian by inference. However, the

appearance of the Holsteinian in the Northern Central European
Plain (e.g., De Beaulieu et al., 2001) appear to indicate a rather
complex picture which does not allow for simple correlations. This
is also evident by the frequent Central European discrepancy to
the British record with correlations of the Holsteinian to MIS 9 and
MIS 11 respectively (e.g., Geyh and Krbetschek, 2012 and references provided above). Especially in light of potential problems in
pollen preservation, bias in deposition, and other factors in the
sedimentation environments at a lake shore/partially lacustrine/
delta/ﬂuvial/channel, i.e. independent of the sedimentological
model, age estimates based on palynology do not seem to be
unproblematic.
While the lacustrine-deltaic sedimentation model (Lang et al.,
2012) does not require a speciﬁc age, the TL result does not
appear to be compatible with the channel model for the sequence
€ ningen proposed by Thieme and Mania (1993), Mania (1998,
of Scho
2006). Additionally a disagreement of the presented dating result
has to be stated with the mammalian record which correlates
€ ningen 13/I with MIS 11 (Van Kolfschoten, 2014), as well as
Scho
with the palynological model if the Holsteinian is correlated with
MIS 11. However, considering the model put forward by Lang et al.
€ ningen 13/I and 13/II do not
(2012, 2015), the sediments of Scho
have to correspond to different MIS and the only discrepancy of the
TL-dating result lies with the generally disputed correlation of the
Holsteinian palynology to MIS 11.

results have to be considered as statistically of the same age. Stra€ nintigraphy, however, provides evidence of the older age of Scho
