THE NEOLITHIC DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION
IN THE U.S. SOUTHWEST
Timothy A. Kohler, Matt Pier Glaude, Jean-Pierre Bocquet-Appel, and Brian M. Kemp

Maize agriculture was practiced in the U.S. Southwest slightly before 2000 B.C., but had a negligible impact on population
growth rates until the development or introduction of more productive landraces; the ability to successfully cultivate maize
under a greater variety of conditions, with dry farming especially important; the addition of beans, squash, and eventually
turkey to the diet; increased sedentism; and what we infer to be the remapping of exchange networks and the development of

efficient exchange strategies in first-millenium-A.D. villages. Our estimates of birthrates and growth rates are derived from
the proportions of immature individuals among human remains. These proportions are somewhat affected by warfare in our
region, and perhaps also by climate. Nevertheless, there is a strong identifiable Neolithic Demographic Transition signal in
the U.S. Southwest in about the mid-first-millennium A.D. in most subregions, visible a few hundred years after the intro
duction of well-fired ceramic containers, and more or less contemporaneous with the first appearance of villages. Indepen
dent genetic data derived from the mitochondrial genomes of present-day indigenous populations of the Southwest are also
consistent with the hypothesis that a major demographic expansion occurred 1,500-2000 years ago in the Southwest.

among those rare periods in human history where

populations found themselves for a time at least
generally below the carrying capacities of their eco
nomic systems in their natural environments.

Summary and Afterthoughts
The long dawn of the Formative in the U.S. South
west reminds us that the line between foraging and

tion were slight or have been blurred by the more

observations we acknowledge the possibility that
more demographic and genetic data from popula
tions predating the appearance of agriculture, and
during the Early Agricultural period, may eventu
ally reveal modest increases in growth rates in con
junction with the earliest appearance of maize. We
would be very surprised, however, if these were as
dramatic as the later increases we document here.
We also remind our readers that our samples are
larger in the northern (Puebloan) Southwest, pos
sibly affecting our conclusions.
As we interpret our results, there is material here

to please and aggravate both the population
pressure theorist, and the aggrandizer theorist, on
the "origins of agriculture" question. The very slow

agriculture is not fine and clearly drawn but should

achieved growth rates for more than two thousand

be conceptualized, especially here, as encompass
ing a diverse set of societies practicing various
degrees of low-level food production or protoagri
culture (Keeley 1995; Smith 2001b) in a variety of

years following the introduction of maize to South

settings, using different strategies. One usual bench

western economies suggest, to us, that populations

were generally near their economically governed
carrying capacities. We suspect that the initial adop

tion and slowly increased dependence on domes

mark for agricultural societies?domestication?

ticated species emerged from nothing more

was passed very early in much of the Southwest.
As we saw in the first part of this article, though,
archaeologists have held conflicting ideas about
the importance and effects of domesticated plants
in societies predating the late prehistoric periods.
Some of this ambiguity can be resolved, as we

dramatic than people seeking the least-costly means

attempt to do here, by considering not just the "sup

ply" side of the subsistence equation (e.g., domes
ticated plants constitute n percent of the diet, which

is typically difficult to reconstruct), but also what

of meeting their subsistence needs in contexts of
changing climates, environments, and demographic
pressures. The changing environment includes the
genomic changes that domesticated species were
undergoing in response to the selective pressures
of domestication.

It seems probable to us, though, that the NDT
beginning around the mid-first-millennium A.D.
coincides with an increased salience for various

we might call the demand side: what are the birth

social and political interactions that may have the

rates, and growth rates, of the populations in ques

growth. We have suggested above what some of
those might be, but much still remains to be con

western Europe, and in the Levant, and as predicted

vincingly unraveled. Is the burst of growth due only

for sedentary agriculturalists? Here we show how
that might be assessed.
Our results, as we interpret them, do not shed

to a completely achieved sedentism in these con

tion? Specifically, have they undergone a Neolithic

allows, or provokes, that sedentism? Though we
