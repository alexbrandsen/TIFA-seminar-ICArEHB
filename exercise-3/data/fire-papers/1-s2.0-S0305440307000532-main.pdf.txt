Abstract
During recent reinvestigations in the Great Cave of Niah in Borneo, the ‘Hell Trench’ sedimentary sequence seen by earlier excavators was
re-exposed. Early excavations here yielded the earliest anatomically-modern human remains in island Southeast Asia. Calibrated radiocarbon
dates, pollen, algal microfossils, palynofacies, granulometry and geochemistry of the ‘Hell Trench’ sequence provide information about environmental and vegetational changes, elements of geomorphic history and information about human activity. The ‘Hell’ sediments were laid down
episodically in an ephemeral stream or pool. The pollen suggests cyclically changing vegetation with forest habitats alternating with more open
environments; indicating that phases with both temperatures and precipitation reduced compared with the present. These events can be correlated
with global climate change sequences to produce a provisional dating framework. During some forest phases, high counts of Justicia, a plant
which today colonises recently burnt forest areas, point to fire in the landscape. This may be evidence for biomass burning by humans, presumably to maintain forest-edge habitats. There is evidence from palynofacies for fire on the cave floor in the ‘Hell’ area. Since the area sampled is
beyond the limit of plant growth, this is evidence for human activity. The first such evidence is during an episode with significant grassland
indicators, suggesting that people may have reached the site during a climatic phase characterised by relatively open habitats w50 ka. Thereafter, people were able to maintain a relatively consistent presence at Niah. The human use of the ‘Hell’ area seems to have intensified through
time, probably because changes in the local hydrological regime made the area dryer and more suitable for human use.

1. Introduction
This paper describes stratigraphic, sedimentary and palynological evidence for changing environments during Oxygen
Isotope Stage 3 (OIS 3) at an area known as ‘Hell Trench’
in the West Mouth of the Great Cave of Niah, Sarawak, and
Malaysian Borneo (Fig. 1), which was the find-spot for the
‘Deep Skull’, a morphologically modern human skull associated with a radiocarbon date for w42 BP (Harrisson, 1958)

and thus for many years the oldest morphologically modern
human remains known in the region. The evidence described
in this paper enables us to address two much-discussed but still
under-researched issues. These are outlined below.
2. Biogeography and rain-forest refugia in
OIS 3 e evidence and conjecture
Although the period w35e50 ka is of critical importance
for understanding the dispersal and subsistence of anatomically modern humans, there is a dearth of palaeoecological
information from OIS 3 terrestrial sites in Island SE Asia.
Biogeographical arguments, on the basis of modern faunal

distributions, hold that the ‘coastal’ lands of north and northwest Borneo, including Niah, may have remained sufficiently
humid during the Late Pleistocene to have been a refugium for
lowland rainforest (Brandon-Jones, 1998; Gathorne-Hardy
et al., 2002). As yet, there is no palaeoenvironmental evidence
to test this theory.
Pollen diagrams from Lake Sentarum and Setia Alam in
west-central and south-central Borneo (Anshari et al.,
2004; Kershaw et al., 2001) provide evidence for tropical
rainforest during the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM) in those
areas. It is suspected, however, that during these times dry
dipterocarp woodland and savannah expanded into regions
now occupied by humid lowland rainforest (Hope et al.,
2004; Bird et al., 2005). It was hypothesised that, in ‘‘Sundaland’’ (the continental shelf north-west of Borneo exposed
by sea level fall during glacial periods: Molengraaf 1921,
Voris 2000) and other low-lying areas, the extent of lowland
rainforest increased (Sun et al., 2000). Further to the northwest, however, palynological evidence from the continental
shelf suggests episodically more open vegetation, perhaps associated with the input of abundant Artemisia pollen and
loess from central Asia (Sun et al., 2000). Cranbrook
(2000) investigated the many vertebrate and invertebrate

remains that are broadly associated with the Niah ‘‘Deep
Skull’’ at w40 ka. These included Presbytis and Pongo:
the overall assemblage implying the local presence of tall
evergreen rainforest forest and some open habitats.
The Late Pleistocene was generally subjected to highly
episodic climatic fluctuations with a wide range of variations
in precipitation and temperature (Shackleton et al., 2004). During the Last Glacial Maximum in Borneo, offshore sea water
temperatures may have been w2e3  C lower than today, while
air temperatures may have been reduced by 6e7  C (Bird et al.,
2005). The estimated reduction in annual precipitation at the
LGM compared to the present is substantial, the cooler annual
air temperatures being associated with a reduction of precipitation of w30e50% (Sun et al., 2000; Kershaw et al., 2001; van
der Kaars et al., 2000; Hope et al., 2004; Bird et al., 2005). The
modern climate in the area is affected on a daily basis by coastal
winds, modulated within the year by the distinctive seasonal reversal of winds and storms associated with the East Asian and
Australian monsoons, whilst El Ni~no episodes can bring strong
and sustained droughts and sometimes fire in the region. It is
probable that similar variability occurred in the past. There is,
however, little compelling evidence to help us reconstruct the
vegetation of this area between w30 and w50 ka.

3. Palaeobiogeographical modelling, human dispersal,
subsistence and biomass burning
The environment offers potential opportunities and constraints to people: thus a detailed understanding of the environment at the time of the early use of the cave constrains
archaeologically based models of human activity. Recent modelling constrained by palaeo-topographic and palaeo-climatic
information, but not supported by any new palaeoecological
data (Bird et al., 2005) suggests that much of ‘‘Sundaland’’
at and before the LGM could have included substantial areas
(or indeed a corridor) of savannah or open woodland, reviving
an earlier interpretation of this landscape. This model could
have critical importance for understanding human behaviour,
dispersal and subsistence in the lowland tropics of Island
Southeast Asia during OIS3. Human movement and activity
in terrain covered in wet lowland rainforest are very different
from similar activity in grasslands, savannah or even open
woodlands. According to some commentators, sustained human activity based on foraging for animal proteins would
have been difficult, if not impossible, in an environment dominated by deep wet tropical forest, as is present at Niah today
(e.g. Headland, 1987; Hutterer, 1988; Bailey et al., 1989;
Townsend, 1990; Bailey and Headland, 1991; Dentan, 1991).
Limited archaeological evidence (Bellwood, 1997) suggests
that foraging in wet tropical lowland forest might have occurred during the Late Pleistocene elsewhere in Island Southeast Asia: the biogeographical evidence discussed above might
suggest similar environments around Niah. Yet, it is clear that
people were at Niah during OIS 3. Thus, if tropical forest was
present at Niah, the people must have developed strategies to
deal with it. If tropical forest was not present, this suggests different scenarios for human activity.
One important strategy e biomass burning e seems to have
been widely used by people to deal with dense wet tropical
forest. Biomass burning apparently related to human activity
at w40,000e30,000 BP has been widely recognised in the
region. High concentrations of micro-charcoal have been detected in deposits correlated with OIS 3, through the southern
parts of Island SE Asia and into Australasia, and offshore in
the Bandung Basin, Java, on the Lombok Ridge south of
Flores, in the Banda Sea, on the north Australian continental
slope at ODP 820 and on land in north Australia at Lynch’s
Crater (Turney et al., 2001; Haberle et al., 2001; Kershaw
et al., 2002; Hope et al., 2004; Thevenon et al., 2004). The
practice of biomass burning during the Late Pleistocene has
not yet been recognised in the northern part of Island Southeast Asia. As a result, it was not known how Late Pleistocene
human activities around the Great Cave might differ from
those of people further south who appear to have burned
biomass as part of their pattern of activities.

4. The Great Cave of Niah
The Great Cave of Niah is one of the largest and most
intensively studied caves in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. In

1955

many ways the site is still a cornerstone archaeological site
in Southeast Asia.
Between 1954 and 1967, Tom and Barbara Harrisson excavated in the West Mouth of the Great Cave of Niah (Fig. 1).
They recorded and partially published probably the most important archaeological sequence yet recovered in Island
Southeast Asia. A critical find was the ‘Deep Skull’. This was
recovered from some 1.6 m below the local surface of the sedimentary fill of the West Mouth in an excavation unit named ‘Hell
Trench’ by the Harrissons. The trench name apparently refers to
the extremely uncomfortable working conditions in this area,
characterised by confined air circulation, strong ammonia flux
from the sediments, very high humidity and extreme warmth.
Associated charcoal was subjected to one of the earliest archaeological applications of radiocarbon dating, through
an ‘enhancement technique’ at Groningen, and an age of
w42,000 radiocarbon years established (Harrisson, 1958,
1959a,b; Barker et al., 2002b; Gilbertson et al., 2005), for
decades making this skull the oldest skeletal remains of an
anatomically modern human in the world.
It is clear from Tom Harrisson’s manuscript notes and from
notes and diagrams made by Lord Medway that they distinguish distinct sedimentary units, but these were not described
in their published accounts (Gilbertson et al., 2005). A combination of the absence of a published stratigraphy, the possibility that the ‘‘Deep Skull’’ might be intrusive from much
younger burials, and general doubts about the ageedepth approach used by the Harrissons has led to doubts not only about
the antiquity ‘‘Deep Skull’’ (Anderson 1997; Bellwood, 1997;
Gilbertson et al., 2005), but also perhaps about other aspects of
T. Harrison’s work (see also Zuraina Majid, 1982). Further, in
spite of the involvement of a number of specialists in these
early excavations, there was no published detailed assessment
of the environmental context of this e at that time e earliest
modern human activity in Island Southeast Asia and Australasia.
The position was still substantially the same before the start
of the Niah Cave Project (of which this paper is an outcome)
in 2000.
The Great Cave lies at the northeast corner of the Gunung
Subis, an isolated tower karst massif in Miocene patch-reef
limestones of the Subis Limestone Member of the Tangap Formation (Leichti et al., 1960; Wilford, 1964; Banda, 2001). The
Great Cave lies some 64 km SSW of Miri, the regional capital,
and 12 km inland from the coast of the South China Sea. It lies
only 1e2 km from the tidal waters of the Sungai Niah, however, and the very deepwater of the Northwest Sabah-Palawan
Deep Ocean Trough is just 150 km to the north. The Island of
Borneo lies in some of the warmest seas on earth, with modern
temperatures averaging w28  C (Yan et al., 2002). The South
China Sea, to the North, is part of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool,
which has a major effect on the present-day wet tropical climate in Borneo (Tapper, 2002). Hazebroek and Morshidi
(2001) note mean annual rainfall of w2000 mm a1 at Niah,
reaching w5000 mm a1 on higher ground further inland,
and a daily temperature range from 22  C before dawn to
32  C in the afternoon. Around the Gunung Subis are coastal
mangrove and alluvial swamp forests, with lowland

C.O. Hunt et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 34 (2007) 1953e1969

1956

dipterocarp forests on low-relief topography developed in Tangap Formation siltstones and sandstones (Pearce, 2004).
The West Mouth is the largest of the mouths of the Great
Cave, a low arch up to 60 m high and 180 m across. It opens
w12 m up the cliff-like side of the rock-floored gorge which
separates the karst tower containing the Great Cave from the
main massif of the Gunung Subis. The cave mouth is partly
blocked by a rampart of speleothem and rockfall debris and
by vegetation (Gilbertson et al., 2005). The Harrisson excavations are on the north side of the West Mouth, immediately inside the entrance to the cave (Fig. 1). Further location details
are given by Barker et al. (2000, 2002, 2007).
The research reported here has proceeded directly from
cleaned-up exposures left by T. Harrisson and Zuraina Majid
in the West Mouth. It is part of a multidisciplinary re-investigation which has examined both the remaining exposures and
the large archived collections in the Sarawak Museum’s collections (Barker et al., 2000, 2001, 2002a,b, 2003, 2005,
2007; Barker, 2005; Gilbertson et al., 2005). Taphonomic research investigating the contemporary depositional patterns
of guano and airfall material in the West Mouth (Hunt and
Rushworth, 2005a) showed that there are gross lateral variations in sedimentation rate and type, with a zone in the cave
mouth dominated by wind-blown silt and airfall pollen, with
the interior of the cave dominated by guano from bats and
swiftlets containing very abundant pollen derived from their
foraging activities. The stratigraphy of the remaining Late
Quaternary sedimentary sequence exposed in the West Mouth
has been described recently (Dykes, in press; Gilbertson et al.,
2005; Stephens et al., 2005; Table 1). The West Mouth sediments are the result of airfall, wash, fluvial, colluvial and mudflow processes, with episodic surface ponding and drainage
(Gilbertson et al., 2005). Recent unpublished and published investigations of the remaining excavation faces in and around
the ‘‘Hell Trench’’ also indicated that traces of human activity
in the West Mouth of the Great Cave occur from 45,900  800
BP uncalibrated (OxA-V-2057-31) (Barker et al., 2001,
2002a,b, 2007; Barker, 2005; Gilbertson et al., 2005). Thereafter, there was episodic human activity through the Late Pleistocene and most of the Holocene. This research is offering
insights into human behaviour in the cave and in its hinterland.

As part of this, the palynological, sedimentological and geochemical investigations described here identify changing environments and traces of human activity inside and outside the
cave during part of OIS 3.
5. Materials and methods
In the West Mouth excavation area, Gilbertson et al. (2005)
distinguish four major sedimentary units of Pleistocene age
(apart from a thin band of fluvial deposits (unit 5) adjacent
to the cave wall). These are briefly described in Table 1,
with present emphasis on their Unit 2 which yielded the samples described here. Unit 2 is a sequence of waterlain and colluvial deposits. Field and micromorphological studies
indicated that this deposit accumulated during episodic small
floods of limited power, in small pools and as small mudflows,
in a linear hollow eroded into underlying components of Units
2C and 1 and the limestone bedrock of the cave entrance lip.
The accumulating sediments of Unit 2 were prone to dry out,
producing polygonally cracked muds that were re-entrained by
later flows and re-deposited as rip-up clasts. The hollow
opened to the north into a basin 10e15 m across where the water drained through the sedimentary fill into a swallow-hole inferred from geophysical data. In sediment-thin sections, bone,
charcoal, and other localized evidence of human activity were
observed upon former palaeosurfaces together with fluviallyproduced graded bedding and water-escape structures (Stephens et al., 2005). Small accumulations of ash and charcoal
lie in shallow depressions, typically 30 cm across, on old
land surfaces in this unit. These might be interpreted as the remains of fires. One surface could be extrapolated directly to
the inferred find-spot of the ‘‘Deep Skull’’ (Barker et al.,
2002a,b, 2007) although the actual location was completely
removed by the earlier investigations. The western margin of
Unit 2 interdigitates with Unit 2C, a complex of slope, colluvial and organic deposits and archaeological remains (Table
1). Unit 2C also includes the debris from the collapse and disintegration of a large speleothem column, which on the evidence of field relationships, took place during the
accumulation of this unit. Material shed from human activity
on the cave entrance lip accumulated with Units 2 and 2C.

C.O. Hunt et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 34 (2007) 1953e1969

Distinct variations in the three-dimensional geometry and lithological properties of Unit 2 were mapped in the field; and it is
probable that many plant and animal remains and distinctive
‘‘concentrated bone’’ assemblages recorded by Harrisson
(1965, 1970) were parts of the deposits that are now attributed
to this lithofacies.
The faces of the excavations by the Harrissons and their local extension by Zuraina Majid (1982) were sound and in good
condition and were thoroughly cleaned back to reveal fresh
sediment for the stratigraphical study. These faces were then
further prepared using a cleaned trowel, immediately before
sampling for this study. Five monoliths were taken to provide
a continuous set of samples through the thickest and most
complete sequence remaining of Unit 2 (Figs. 1 and 2). Monoliths were wrapped in aluminium foil and cling wrap and
stored briefly in an air-conditioned room before return to the
UK. In the UK, they were stored in a cold room at 4  C before
analysis. This study reports investigations of monoliths 1e3.
Macroscopic charcoal was extremely rare in this sequence.
Spot samples for dating were taken, therefore, where charcoal
was visible in the cleaned faces and AMS dated using the
ABOX-SC technique (Bird et al., 1999) at Canberra in the
Research School of Earth Sciences. The results of the dating
programme are described and evaluated by Bird (2001) and
further discussed below. The studied sequence lies stratigraphically immediately below a feature containing charcoal dated
by Bird (2001) to 42,600  670 BP (Niah-310). A few
centimetres higher a fragment of charcoal gave a date of
41,800  620 BP (Niah-311). Below these dates the chronology
of the section is thus largely inferential. It is ‘anchored’ at the
top by the radiocarbon ages, but no material suitable for radiocarbon analysis was found below these levels in this profile. As
yet, attempts to provide parallel series of OSL age estimates are

1957

not yet fully resolved (Stephens, 2004; Stephens et al., 2007).
As a result, the somewhat risky procedure of matching the studied sequence against global standards, such as the GRIP record
(Dansgaard et al., 1993; Johnsen et al., 2001; Shackleton et al.,
2004) is followed here. There are problems with this approach,
because the GRIP record is itself dated largely by extrapolation
from relatively few securely dated points (Shackleton et al.,
2004) and not all authorities are yet convinced that the
sub-Heinrich climatic changes have global expression. Shorttimescale climatic oscillation in the Australian tropics has,
however, been argued to be in phase with the GISP2 O18
DeO cyclicity (Turney et al., 2004).
All analysed samples reported here for palynology, diatoms
and geochemistry were taken from monolith faces 1e3 that
were cleaned immediately before analysis in the laboratory.
Each monolith was opened in turn and 5 cm thick subsamples
were taken for analysis. These were divided between various
analyses described below.
Samples for chemical and granulometric work were dried at
room temperature in covered food-grade plastic trays, and then
gently disaggregated with pestle and mortar until fine enough to
pass through a 2mm stainless steel sieve. Geochemical analysis
on bulk powder samples was carried out using a Spectro X-Lab
XRF machine. Further detailed analysis was carried out using
ICPMS (Grattan et al., 2004). Calcium carbonate was determined with a Bascomb Calcimeter following the procedure of
Gale and Hoare (1991). Magnetic susceptibility was determined using a Bartington MS1. Loss on ignition was done using
the low temperature method of Gale and Hoare (1991) with
combustion at 425  C for 24 h. Analysis of granulometry was
done using the Pipette method (Gale and Hoare, 1991).
Palynological methods follow a variation of the method of
Hunt (1985), which has been shown to give the best recovery

in cave sediments where acetolysis destroys fragile pollen and
spores (Coles, 1989). Subsamples of 5 cm3 were disaggregated
by boiling in 5% sodium hydroxide solution for 10 min, then
3% sodium pyrophosphate solution for 10 min, and then
sieved on nominal 6 mm nylon mesh to remove fines and
solutes. Coarse clastics and small fossils were removed by
sieving through 120 mm nylon mesh. The resulting suspension
was decalcified by addition of 5% hydrochloric acid. One slide
was made up from each sample at this stage, but pollen concentrations were rather low in many samples. The samples were
then treated with cold 20% hydrofluoric acid for two days,
and then carefully neutralised by dilution. The neutralised samples were then washed in warm hydrochloric acid, sieved on
6 mm nylon mesh, alkalinised using 5% KOH solution and
stained with safranin before mounting in modified Gurr Aquamount. All procedures were carried out using distilled or filtered
water and blanks were run to ensure the integrity of the procedures. Analysis of pollen was done in transmitted light and
Nomarski interference contrast at 400 and 1000 magnification.
The pollen samples were checked for integrity and coherence
using UV-fluorescence microscopy (Hunt et al., 2007).
Palynofacies analysis enumerates all the particulate organic
matter present in a palynological sample. It differentiates local
patterns of environmental change and human activity by using
patterns of particulate organic matter occurrence (Hunt and
Coles, 1988). This approach, while successful in other archaeological contexts (Hunt and Coles, 1988; Hunt, 2000; Hunt
et al., 2001, 2002; Hunt and Rushworth, 2005b), has not been
used in an archaeological cave site previously, so this study
evaluates the usefulness of this approach. Palynofacies counts
used the slides prepared for the pollen analysis using the conventions of Hunt and Coles (1988). In the palynofacies counts,
material which is brown to dark brown in colour as a result of
strong heating is described as thermally mature. Much thermally mature material shows residual cellular structures and
can be equated with the material described as ‘microcharcoal’
by some pollen analysts. Other thermally mature material is
without regular structure and can be described as amorphous:
unpublished taphonomic studies by COH suggest that this
material results from the heating of unstructured (amorphous)
organic matter in the soil below small fires. The other categories
used in this account should be self-explanatory.
6. Results
6.1. Sedimentology
Monoliths 1e3 in Unit 2 of the ‘Hell’ sequence consist of
trough cross-bedded and occasionally plane-bedded strongbrown sands, silts, clays and diamicts (Gilbertson et al.,
2005). Most samples are relatively poorly sorted and can be
described as sandy silty clays, silty sandy clays and silty
clayey sands. Ripple marked sand bodies and diamict plugs
are apparent in the infills of some scours. Occasional concentrations of bone and charcoal, together with isolated reddened
clay rip-up clasts are present at the base of some scours. Grainsize analysis (Fig. 3) shows at least 10 cycles of changing

grain-size in the sediments sampled in this study, with sand
peaks at 203, 188, 153, 143, 123, 103, 78, 68, 43 and 8 cm.
The change in grain size is variable in direction e a coarsening-upward unit is apparent at the base of the section and
others at 103e88 cm and 38e30 cm, but fining-upward units
are also apparent, e.g. at 203e190 cm, 143e128 cm and
43e33 cm. These cycles of changing grain size are consistent
with the trough cross-bedding seen in the sampled sections and
most probably reflect pulses of ‘flashy’ discharge in a small
channel aligned NortheSouth through the ‘Hell’ area (Gilbertson et al., 2005). Coarsening-up probably reflects increasing
turbidity, while fining-up cyclicity most probably reflects declines in the turbidity of flows. The diamict plugs most probably reflect places where either the ‘tail’ of a flow event was
exceedingly turbid and graded into a small mudflow, or where
a small mudflow from the guano pile in the cave entered the
channel. The ripple-marked horizons suggest that shallow water subject to slow flow or (less probably in the context of the
cave-mouth) to wind disturbance. The concentrations of bone
and charcoal sampled are most probably lag deposits, where
fine materials were winnowed out by fluvial erosion leaving
these larger elements behind. Samples with over 50% clay
occur at 213e208, 193, 168, 148, 128, 113, 88e83, 63 and
33e3 cm e these may reflect episodes of quiet-water sedimentation, where clay settled out of residual pools, except between 33 and 3 cm, where the sediments appear to be mostly
sand-sized clay pellets, which probably behaved hydrologically as sand. Alternatively, it is possible that some concentrations of clay may reflect formation of clay minerals by
pedogenic processes during still-stands in deposition, though
this remains to be verified by thin-section analysis. Clay ripup clasts reflect desiccation of clay-rich quiet-water deposits,
with the consolidated hardened clay fragments then caught
up in subsequent flash-floods and redeposited. The red-brown
colours of the unit suggest that some, but not all, of the material is either derived from, or shares a common origin with, red
clay soils that can be observed on the summit of the Gunung
Subis massif. Red clays are also visible lower in the depositional sequence in the cave (Gilbertson et al., 2005). The origin of the silt-sized material which is predominant in the Hell
sequence is problematic e the Subis Limestones contain remarkably little silt-sized clastic material. Loessic input to
the South China Sea during the Late Pleistocene was suggested by Sun et al. (2000) and the grain size characteristics
of these cave deposits are perhaps consistent with them being
partially derived from loess.
6.2. Geochemistry
The geochemistry through the ‘Hell’ sequence is remarkably uniform across the studied section (Figs. 4e6). The
most common elements through the whole sequence are Silicon (34e57%), Aluminium (19e29%), Phosphorus (18e
27%) and Calcium (1e16%). Loss on ignition, which varies
between 3 and 17%, is likely to include organic matter and
weight loss by the dehydration of gypsum during the combustion (although this is likely to be minor given the low figures

for sulphur, discussed below). Low-frequency magnetic susceptibility is low, between 0.4 and 1.2 susceptibility units. It
is highest in zones H-9 and H-10. The Aluminium and Silicon
relate to silicate and alumino-silicate minerals, probably
mostly quartz silt-sand and clay minerals. The high Phosphorus is likely to be derived partly from bone apatite (Calcium
Phosphate) and partly from bird and bat guano. Some Calcium
is present as Calcium Carbonate, but the calcimetry indicates
that this is minor except in zones H-5 and H-6. A little Calcium is also likely to be present as gypsum (hydrated Calcium
Sulphate), but the low figures for Sulphur suggest that this is
an unimportant component of the sediments. Elsewhere,
most Calcium not present as calcite is probably present in
bone apatite. There is no evidence for human occupation in
the metal geochemistry. Values for zinc (10e44 ppm) and copper (4e7 ppm) both fell below crustal averages (Wedepohl,
1995). Lead values (9e51 ppm) do occasionally fall above
the crustal average, but the mean value 20 ppm is very
close to the crustal average value of 17 ppm. Crudely, the
sequence can be divided into seven (Table 2), the boundaries in most cases coinciding with the boundaries of pollen
zones.
6.3. Palynology
In general, the preservation of pollen in monoliths 1e3 is
extremely good, with virtually all grains in all samples threedimensional and taking stain in a uniform way. The fluorescence colour of pollen in all samples under UV is a uniform

dark red. The uniformity of the fluorescence signature, and
the uniform staining characteristics of the material are consistent with a simple and uncomplicated taphonomic pathway
and a lack of recycled or intrusive material (Hunt et al.,
2007). Pollen was identified using Bernard Maloney’s type
collection, held at Queen’s University, Belfast. Some pollen
could not be identified because no type material existed or
because it was obscured by debris. These were logged as Indeterminate. The upper part of the sequence, however, contains a number of horizons containing no pollen at all,
although in most of these, particulate organic carbon is present and was evaluated in the palynofacies counts. High concentrations of phytoliths are present in the pollen slides from
samples that do not contain pollen. This phenomenon is
discussed further below.
A series of eleven pollen assemblageebiozones (hereafter
termed zones) was distinguished (Table 3). In the following
sections and in Figs. 7e10, pollen taxa are described as %
total pollen and spores, excluding Justicia, together with juvenile pollen which are sometimes so common that all other
palynological signals would be obscured if they were included
in the pollen sum and which are therefore calculated and displayed as a percentage of the other pollen and spores (Fig. 9).
Algae are computed as % pollen and spores (Fig. 9) and palynofacies are computed as % palynofacies (Fig. 10). In Figs.
7e9, where the pollen sum is less than 100 the histogram
bars of the pollen diagram are unshaded. The pollen biostratigraphy is used as a framework for the later parts of the
paper.

7. Discussion
7.1. Establishment of a chronology
Deposition in the Hell sequence was certainly not continuous. Textural, geochemical, field and stratigraphic evidence
have been presented in this paper to show that deposition
was episodic, with several still-stands. The boundaries between pollen assemblage biozones in this sequence are mostly
very sharp, suggesting of discontinuities in deposition. Thus,
occasional relatively short-lived depositional events were
most probably sampling airfall pollen that had accumulated
on surfaces in the cave over the preceding weeks, months
and years. The fact that there is systematic variation of pollen
assemblages within some zones suggests, however, that some
depositional events took several hundred years during episodes
when climatic change drove vegetational change. There are,
however, most probably gaps of considerable e and irregular e
duration between the depositional events. There is therefore the
likelihood that entire climatic events, associated with vegetational

change, are not represented in the sequence described here and
hence there is a possibility that the number of climatic fluctuations is under-counted. Therefore, ages derived this way can
be regarded only as provisional minimum estimates. Nevertheless, the pattern of vegetational change does suggest that a series
of climatic events is recorded, and the dating of charcoal in
nearby baulks in the same stratigraphic unit in the cave fill, at
the same altitude and less than 5 m away (Barker et al.,
2002a,b, 2007), suggests that there are no very long gaps in
the sequence.
Immediately above the studied section, Bird (2001) obtained radiocarbon dates in stratigraphic sequence of 41,800 
800 BP (Niah-311) and 42,600  670 BP (Niah-310), the latter
in an archaeological feature, thus precluding recycling
(Fig. 2). These were calibrated using the program of Fairbanks
et al. (2005) to provide ages of 45,500  695 and
46,200  624 cal. BP (Table 3). The substantial percentages
of mangrove and lowland forest pollen during biozones H-9
to H-11 at the top of the studied section (Fig. 9) is consistent
with this being a time of major marine transgression and

temperatures perhaps similar to modern. The evidence from
the mangrove pollen for a high sea stand and the high percentages of swamp forest and lowland forest taxa suggest that this
is probably a major interstadial. In contrast, biozone H-8 is
characterised by high percentages of herbaceous taxa and little
mangrove pollen (Fig. 9), suggesting a drier, more open environment and low sea levels. In many parts of the Australasian
tropical zone, arid episodes are likely to be contemporaneous
with northern hemisphere stadials (Hope et al., 2004: 108e
112). It thus seems likely that episodes with high percentages
of lowland forest taxa may be correlated with global interstadial phases, and episodes with high percentages of open
ground taxa correlate with global stadial episodes. The calibrated dates immediately above the studied section fall between 45.5 and 46.2 thousand calendar years and perhaps
the most likely correlation for the immediately underlying biozones H-11 to H-9 is with GRIP Interstadial 12 of Johnsen
et al. (2001). Using a ‘count from the top’ approach (Table
4) this would suggest that the interstadial represented by the
lowland forest episode in H-7 to H-5 is GRIP Interstadial
13, (w49 ka: Johnsen et al., 2001) and the base of the Hell sequence is possibly late in GRIP Interstadial 14, which ends
w52 ka (Johnsen et al., 2001) (Table 5).
7.2. The Pleistocene environment at Niah
In this section, the results are synthesised and the Pleistocene environment at Niah reconstructed. In the absence of
secure dating, the framework for this section is the pollen biostratigraphy. The biogeography and ecology of the plant taxa
follow Muller (1972), Anderson and Muller (1975), Ashton
(1988), Kamaludin and Azmi (1997), Morley (2000) and
Pearce (2004). The ecology of the algal taxa follows Pals
et al. (1980), Hunt et al. (1985) and unpublished work by
COH. Taphonomic calibration is provided by Hunt and Rushworth (2005a).
The start of the studied sequence in monoliths 1e3 is
provisionally inferred to lie late in GRIP Interstadial 14 at

w52 ka. Zone H-1, dominated by Podocarpus with some herbaceous species, is consistent with a lowered treeline e Podocarpus today is not found below 100 m regionally (Pearce,
2004) and is most common in montane forest (Muller,
1972), for instance forming monospecific stands on Mount
Kinabalu. Podocarpus today is very rare in lowland Borneo
outside kerangas (sparse forest developed on well-draining
highly acid sand substrates: Morley, 2000: 202), suggesting
that it is relatively tolerant of drought stress. Dacrydium and
Casuarina, also characteristic of kerangas (Morley, 2000:
202), are present in H-1. The drought-tolerant taxa Myrica,
Casuarina, and Oleaceae are found in coastal dune systems today and are also found at altitude (Muller, 1972). Most of the
open-ground taxa recorded are also drought-tolerant. A climate drier and cooler than present is indicated. The abundant
Saeptodinium sp. reflect an algal bloom, and thus relatively eutrophic conditions, in a relatively deep, permanent water body
(Hunt et al., 1985). The high clay content may reflect deposition in quiet water. A substantial rainfall event during a relatively dry cold period can be inferred.
Zones H-2 to H-4, dominated by open-ground taxa, mostly
Poaceae and Cyperaceae, with herbaceous taxa such as Chenopodiaceae, Asteraceae, Lactucae and Artemisia suggest major
drought stress and the retreat of forest vegetation. A rise of
freshwater swamp and lowland forest taxa during H-3 might
suggest a minor interstadial and a climate more similar to
that of the present day than that of H-2 and H-4.
The current archaeological excavations at Niah have located evidence for human activity e lithics, charcoal and
cut-marked bone e at similar altitudes to the base of the sample column, less than 4 m away in the cave fill (Barker et al.,
2007). The appearance of thermally mature material (often
known as micro-charcoal) in H-2 suggests fire, but because
this material disperses widely during burning, it is unclear
whether this reflects combustion inside or outside the cave,
and the agency is thus necessarily obscure. Thermally mature
amorphous matter, which has a small peak in H-2, however, is
likely to indicate burning local to the deposition site, since the

taphonomy of this extremely fragile material is very localised.
This material is typically derived from the heating of amorphous organic matter within sediments or soils below small
surface fires. Spherules resulting from the burning of fatty or
resinous material are also present at this level. The excavations
in Hell Trench are far enough back in the photic zone of the
cave mouth that no plants grow at this point and thus there
is no local source of combustible material unless imported
by people. Hence, if the dating framework suggested above
is correct, there is evidence for human activity in the cave before GRIP Interstadial 13, at w50 ka.
During H-3, fire in the landscape around the cave is indicated by the presence of frequent Justicia (Fig. 9) which today
forms monospecific swards in the Niah Cave National Park
following fire (K. Pearce, pers. comm. 2003). Albizia and
Kleinhovia are also present in H-3 (Fig. 8), pointing to a disrupted forest canopy. At this point, there is little evidence for
fire within the cave e the thermally mature amorphous counts
are low (Fig. 10). In the Hell Trench pollen diagram, Justicia

regularly peaks during pollen zones characterised by high arboreal pollen counts, suggesting that fires coincided with episodes with dense forest. Although fire is common in the
Borneo forests today (Goldammer and Seibert, 1989), much
of this is anthropogenic: fire is today more commonly perceived to be associated with open savannah-like environments
rather than with tropical forests. It is possible that the Justicia
curve may reflect biomass burning, most likely to maintain
open areas for hunting or to maintain forest-edge habitats
which are rich in accessible wild foods (E. Kerui, pers.
comm. 2003). Biomass burning has been inferred from high
charcoal flux during OIS 3 in Iryan Jaya, western Kalimantan
and deep-sea cores across the region (e.g. Hope, 1998; van der
Kaars et al., 2000; Turney et al., 2001; Haberle et al., 2001;
Kershaw et al., 2002; Anshari et al., 2004; Hope et al.,
2004; Thevenon et al., 2004).
The lower part of the sequence is generally fairly rich in
Calcium and Strontium (Figs. 4e6) and consistent with the input of limestone particles resulting from slow granular

disintegration of the cave rook and walls. The sudden, marked
rise in calcimetry values at the start of H-5 at 163 cm probably
reflects an increase in this influx, probably as the result of the
fall and partial disintegration of part of the cave-entrance stalagmite curtain. Gilbertson et al. (2005) showed that this occurred during the accumulation of the Hell sequence. The
correlation discussed above (Table 3) would suggest an age
of w49.5 ka. The palynofacies (Fig. 10) shows distinct minima in thermally mature amorphous matter and thermally mature matter at 168 cm, but both rise at 163 cm, suggesting that
if these curves reflect anthropogenic activity to any extent, the
event had little impact on human use of the cave. The sediments continue to have high calcimetry values until 133 cm.

Thereafter, Calcium and calcimetry are low, suggesting that
disintegration of the stalagmite entrance curtain had ceased.
Most forest taxa expand in H-5 to H-7, including taxa typical of lowland, montane, coastal and swamp forest, although
Podocarpus contracts (Fig. 8). This probably reflects a rise in
rainfall and temperature relative to the previous biozones.
Justicia goes through a series of expansions (Fig. 9), perhaps
consistent with further biomass burning in response to afforestation. In H-6, Justicia and much palm pollen is immature and
in clumps, suggesting derivation from fructifications introduced into the cave rather than the airfall taphonomic route
is likely for most pollen in this sequence (Hunt and
Rushworth, 2005a).

Open ground taxa expand in H-8, mostly Poaceae and Cyperaceae, but also the psilate monolete fern spores (Fig. 8)
which are produced by the ferns that colonise open areas today
(COH, unpublished). Other groups decline. This could reflect
a decline in rainfall and temperature.
At the base of H-9 a very abrupt change in palynological
assemblage composition and a sharp decline in numbers of
pollen (Figs. 9 and 10) recovered per sample suggest a period
of non-deposition and a change in sedimentary facies. H-9 and
H-10 have very high mangrove pollen and high lowland forest
percentages. In H-11, coastal taxa expand, mangroves remain
high, while swamp forest taxa are rare. The most important
mangrove species in H-9 to H-11 is Avicennia. Taphonomic
study (Hunt and Rushworth, 2005a) shows that while pollen
of the mangrove genus Sonneratia is brought into the Great
Cave by vegetarian bats at the present day, Avicennia pollen
is not transported into the cave, although it grows along the
coast in some numbers. As a result it is argued that the high
Avicennia in H-9 to H-11 reflects airfall deposition from
nearby mangrove vegetation. Thus, H-9 to H-11 suggest
warm, perhaps increasingly dry environments and a high sea
stand. Justicia occurs at the base of H-10 and in H-11, perhaps
consistent with further biomass burning.
The number of algae per sample drops at the base of H-9
and the deeper water planktonic species (Peridinioid cysts
and Saeptodinium) virtually disappear. The decline in numbers
of pollen per unit sediment is likely to reflect an increase in the
deposition of clastic material and thus the dilution of pollen,
while the decline of algae in general and the deepwater planktonics in particular indicate shallower, perhaps more ephemeral discharges through the Hell area. Although the pollen
assemblages suggest that it was relatively dry at this time, similar dry phases in H-2 to H-4 and H-8 were not accompanied
by a similar shift in algae. The decline in algae and disappearance of the deepwater planktonics are thus most probably
linked to a change in the hydrological regime inside the cave.
A number of samples in H-9 to H-11 do not contain pollen
and a few contain no organic matter. The properties of the sediment in the field and the magnetic susceptibility data suggest
that the absence of organic materials in some samples may be
the result of hot fires on the sediment surface causing the

oxidation of surface and subsurface organic matter and this
may explain the decline of thermally mature amorphous matter in H-9. It is possible that the sediment surface in the ‘Hell’
area became more attractive to people because it was drier and
less often flooded as a result of the hydrological changes suggested above.
H-9 to H-11 contain many siliceous microfossils e diatoms
and phytoliths. Diatoms from this part of the section include
a variety of estuarine species, including Diploneis spp. (Sarah
Davies, pers. comm. 2005). The near approach of estuarine
waters seems to have enabled the diatoms to be introduced
into the cave by wind, people or animals. Such biological
transport might be on elements of mangrove flora or fauna encrusted with diatoms, or in fauna containing the diatoms in gut
contents, or on the feet or bodies of people or animals who had
been moving about on estuarine mud. The phytoliths are probably the result of the import and burning of wood and other
vegetable matter in the cave (L. Kealhofer, pers. comm.
2005) and are thus consistent with the other evidence of
frequent fire discussed above.
7.3. Human activity
The palynofacies analyses, with thermally mature amorphous matter through most of the sequence, suggest the presence of fire and resultant scorching of the sediments within the
cave and thus (with the concurrent archaeological evidence)
that humans were present virtually from the initiation of deposition at this site, tentatively suggested to be w52 ka. The date
is as early as humans are reported in well-dated contexts anywhere else in Island SE Asia or Australia. In this paper, in the
absence of evidence to the contrary, and given the presence of
the ‘‘Deep Skull’’ and other fragmentary human remains, we
assume that this palaeoecological evidence is the result of anatomically modern humans, rather than Homo erectus or
Homo floresiensis. It is impossible to be sure from the evidence discussed here precisely what people were doing in
the cave other than making fires (see Barker et al., 2007, for
further details of the archaeology), but it can be suggested
from the palynofacies that the human activity became more intense in the cave after w47 ka.
Despite the fact that the palaeoecological evidence at the
site indicates that the climate, and consequently the regional
vegetation, went through a series of very rapid and intense
changes, the palynofacies indicators suggest that human presence was relatively uninterrupted at the Great Cave. This
attests to the flexibility and adaptability e attributes of
behavioural modernity e of the Niah people. These findings
also suggest that palynofacies analysis may have a key role
in the investigation of caves where there is only sparse evidence for human activity as evidenced by more conventional
methodologies.
Deliberate biomass burning may be indicated by the coincidence of abundant Justicia pollen with forest phases. This
first happens in H-3, shortly after the first convincing signs
of human presence w50 ka, and close to the time that biomass
burning is first reported in Indonesia and Australia (Kershaw

C.O. Hunt et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 34 (2007) 1953e1969

et al., 2002, 2003; Thevenon et al., 2004) and but earlier than
western Kalimantan (Anshari et al., 2004). Justicia then recurs
again in H-5 to H-7 (w49e48 ka), and again, to a small
amount in H-10 (w47 ka). This may point directly to people
controlling their environment by creating resource-rich forest-marginal and regenerating environments during times of
high forest. These observations must, however, be treated
cautiously until corroborated by other lines of evidence, particularly as natural fires are held to be part of Bornean ecosystems today (Goldammer and Seibert, 1989).
These finding also offer a local resolution of anthropological debates concerning the ability of Pleistocene foragers to
find sufficient protein within wet tropical forested environments (Bailey et al., 1989; Townsend, 1990; Bailey and
Headland, 1991; Dentan, 1991). In brief, the adjacent
landscape was sometimes forested e giving rise to the palaeontological evidence for forest (Cranbrook, 2000) e at other
times savannah-like vegetation was prevalent. But people at
Niah may also have already developed strategies to cope
with forest growth by biomass burning. Likewise, considerations of human dispersal in the region take on a new perspective with the demonstration of episodes characterised by
significant areas of open vegetation, through which movement
would not have been arduous. The spatial details and precise
chronology of the shifting landscape mosaic during the Late
Pleistocene still require exploration, however.
8. Conclusion
This paper has integrated several proxies which provide evidence for a series of significant shifts in the character of the
vegetation adjacent to the Great Cave of Niah during part of
OIS 3. These shifts reflect the impact of climatic, vegetational,
sea-level and human influences. Radiocarbon ages anchor the
upper part of the sequence at w45e46 ka cal BP. Correlation
between local biotic signals and the GRIP sequence (Dansgaard et al., 1993) suggests the studied sequence may extend
to w52 ka. The sequence is, however, discontinuous: it is possible therefore that the base is older than a simple count from
the top would suggest.
Northern Borneo has been suggested as a major refugium
for tropical rainforest during the Late Pleistocene. This paper
shows that lowland rainforest species occurred only episodically at this location during OIS 3. This finding is compatible
with the earlier conclusions of Cranbrook (2000). The biogeographical results of Gathorne-Hardy et al. (2002) are perhaps
explained by the retention of closed forest on the higher parts
of the island, for instance on Mount Kinabalu, which would
have had orographic rainfall even during drier episodes.
This research suggests a more complex and dynamic local
biogeography than envisioned previously for northern Sarawak during the Late Pleistocene. The Niah area was cyclically
dominated by lowland forest, montane forest, and open savannah-like vegetation. These indicate combinations of lower
temperatures and much reduced precipitation compared with
the present day. The data presented here offer support for
the savannah corridor hypothesis of Bird et al. (2005) for the

1967

dispersal of the earliest modern people in the region. Biomass
burning may have taken place during more forest-rich phases
and therefore people were not necessarily foraging under
closed canopy high forest. The first palynofacies evidence
for people in the entrance to the Great Cave at Niah is during
a savannah phase, tentatively dated to w50 ka. Thereafter,
people seem to have maintained a more-or-less consistent
presence at Niah.
