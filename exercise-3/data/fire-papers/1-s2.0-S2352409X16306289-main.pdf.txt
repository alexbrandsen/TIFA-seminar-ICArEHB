According to radiometric dates and the current state of research, the Balearic Islands were not colonized by
humans prior to c. 4420/4220 cal yr BP. Therefore, it is possible to know the natural evolution of the landscape
of the Balearic Islands for the ﬁrst two-thirds of the Holocene (c. 10,000 to c. 4300 cal yr BP). This study aims
to improve our understanding of the respective roles of human societies and/or climate in the transformation
of vegetation cover during the Late Holocene in this Western Mediterranean archipelago. The results show the
importance and control of climate oscillations in the evolution of vegetation throughout the Early and Middle Holocene. Our data clearly show that the transformation of the landscape started before the ﬁrst human settlements.
In Minorca (north-eastern Gymnesian Islands), this upheaval occurred between 5825 and 4675 cal yr BP (fourth
to third millennium BC), while in Majorca (the largest of the Gymnesian Islands) the transition is less well dated,
oscillating between 7169 and 2535 cal yr BP. In the southern Pityusic Islands, observed changes in Ibiza are less
pronounced and coincide with the 4.2 cal kyr BP climate event, synchronous with human colonization. The correlation between forest ﬁres and rapid climate events, as well as the resilience of vegetation until the Middle Ages
(tenth century) in Ibiza, suggest that the evolution of climatic conditions is the preponderant parameter for
explaining Holocene vegetation changes on these islands.

1. Introduction
Palaeoecological research focused on the Holocene has allowed for
assessing the relationship between climate change and vegetation history. Generally, drying and cooling oscillations are documented during the
Holocene, and a transition from wetter to drier conditions is observed in
the Mediterranean area, which consolidated after the Middle-to-Late Holocene transition and affected the landscape conﬁguration with the expansion of Mediterranean sclerophyllous woodland (Jalut et al., 2000;
Roberts et al., 2001; Sadori and Narcisi, 2001; Carrión et al., 2010;
Pérez-Obiol et al., 2011). However, there is debate about the causes of
changes in vegetation evolution from the Neolithic onwards due to the

increasing trend of human impact. The adoption of farming practices presupposes an alteration of natural landscapes and presents a remarkable
new factor to consider when investigating palaeoenvironmental changes
(Ruddiman, 2003; Ruddiman et al., 2015), and especially vegetation
changes, as found in some pollen records from the Mediterranean area
(Riera-Mora and Esteban-Amat, 1994; Sadori and Narcisi, 2001; Yll et
al., 2003; Drescher-Schneider et al., 2007; Colombaroli et al., 2008; Kouli
and Dermitzakis, 2008; Vannière et al., 2008; Vescovi et al., 2010;
Marinova et al., 2012; Revelles et al., 2015).
Islands have always been considered ‘experimental laboratories’ for
the detailed study of environmental change because of their high sensitivity (isolated areas and low resilience) to climatic and anthropic factors. Most studies have shown that the human colonization of islands
contributed to environmental change and landscape transformation
(Flenley et al., 1991; Dumont et al., 1998; Vigne, 1999; Prebble and
Dowe, 2008). However, with more detailed research, it is possible to

assess whether climatic factors were important variables in vegetation
resilience (Athens et al., 2002; Sáez et al., 2009; Cañellas-Boltà et al.,
2013; Rull et al., 2013, 2015). Distinguishing between the two aforementioned factors is often very difﬁcult, especially considering possible
sedimentary hiatuses and reversals in radiometric dating in the studied
palaeoenvironmental sequences (e.g. Horrocks et al., 2013). This does
not facilitate an understanding of natural landscape evolution and the
role of humans in such changes. Our interest in the Balearic Islands
stems from the fact that human presence is not attested until around
c. 4320 cal yr BP (2500–2300 cal BC), with a population increase occurring around 3650 cal yr BP. The archipelago, with islands of small and
medium dimensions (Table 1), is located in the Western Mediterranean
(Fig. 1) and presents a typical Mediterranean climate (Table 1).
In Minorca and Mallorca, potential vegetation is typically Mediterranean, made up of Balearic evergreen oak forests (with Quercus ilex as the
main component) and, in lower and windier areas, shrub formations related to thermo-Mediterranean forests (Peinado and Rivas-Martínez,
1987). These are dominated by Olea europaea var. sylvestris, Prasium
majus, Euphorbia dendroides, and Phillyrea rodriguezii (Rivas-Martínez,
1987). The domain of the Phoenician juniper (Juniperus phoenicea) appears in Ibiza and Formentera.
This article summarizes pollen and anthracological results obtained
up to now in the largest archipelago of the Western Mediterranean in
archaeological and natural contexts. The fact that the Balearic Islands
were uninhabited until the Late Holocene permits assessment of the climatic control of vegetation evolution in a Mediterranean area during
the Middle Holocene. We aim to show the importance of climate in
the Mediterranean Holocene landscape with or without human inﬂuence. Here, we i) evaluate the inﬂuence of climate change on vegetation
evolution during the Middle-to-Late Holocene, ii) reconstruct the impact of human colonization on the landscape from the Late Holocene
onwards, and iii) assess natural differences and compare climate change
inﬂuence and vegetation evolution between the islands.
2. History of human occupation
Archaeological evidence from the Balearic Islands is relatively recent
compared to other insular Mediterranean territories, and to date there
are no vestiges from the Neolithic period (Micó, 2005, 2006). Nevertheless, the dates of the ﬁrst occupation and permanent human settlement
of these islands are not well deﬁned yet. Although evidence reveals that
humans arrived on these islands during the sixth millennium BP, the
most detailed dates for their arrival range from 4850 to 4300 cal yr BP
(2900–2350 cal yr BC) (Alcover, 2008; Guerrero and Calvo, 2008;
Guerrero and Calvo, 2008). From then onwards, Chalcolithic settlements are developed on all the islands (Calvo et al., 2002; Calvo and
Guerrero, 2002; Micó, 2006) (Table 2), but remains from this period
are still rare. However, it is clear that around 4300–3800 cal yr BP a sedentary culture with demographic continuity throughout the archipelago
developed, known as the Naviform (Middle Bronze Age) (Guerrero,
2007; Lull et al., 1999). It was from this time that cyclopean

monumental architecture appeared with the generalization of
navetiforms—megalithic structures forming the Naviform villages.
These villages do not present surrounding walls or urban traces. Later,
around 2850–2750 cal yr BP (900–800 cal yr BC), Naviform society experienced structural changes culminating in the birth of the Talayotic
Culture (Early Iron Age) (Lull et al., 1999; Guerrero et al., 2002). This culture involved a monumental architecture of public buildings and varied
typologies, with the so-called talayots being the most representative.
From 2500 cal yr BP (550 cal yr BC), the destruction of some Talayotic
villages is detected, as well as the diversiﬁcation of funeral rituals and
the emergence of new religious monuments. These changes led to the
birth of post-Talayotic Culture (Late Iron Age), which extended until
the Roman conquest of the Balearic Islands in 2073 cal yr BP (123
cal yr BC) (Lull et al., 1999; Guerrero et al., 2002). With this conquest,
the Romanization of the archipelago began, which resulted in the creation of three cultural and economic focal points: the new cities of Palma,
Pollentia, and Bocchoris. Roman domination lasted until 1416 cal yr BP
(534 CE), when the Vandal conquest opened a period of instability
with the domination of or relationship with Byzantium. This period
ended with the conquest and domination of the archipelago by Muslims
in 1048 cal yr BP (902 CE), and later in 721 cal yr BP (1229 CE) with the
Christian conquest, which annexed the Balearic archipelago to the
Catalano-Aragonese crown.
3. Reviewed sites and palaeovegetation data
These islands have not been widely studied from a
palaeoenvironmental perspective. For this study, we selected the sites
which have well-dated continuous palynological sequences (Fig. 1).
From the island of Minorca, we selected the sites of Cala'n Porter (Yll
et al., 1997; Carrión et al., 2012), Algendar (Yll et al., 1997;
Pérez-Obiol and Sadori, 2007; Carrión et al., 2012), and Es Grau
(Burjachs, 2006; Carrión et al., 2012). From Majorca, we chose the site
of Albufera d'Alcúdia (Burjachs et al., 1994; Pérez-Obiol and Sadori,
2007; Carrión et al., 2012), while on Ibiza we selected the site of Prat
de Vila (Yll et al., 2009; Carrión et al., 2012). In addition, the sites of
Els Closos de Can Gaià, Son Ferrer (Picornell-Gelabert et al., 2012), Cas
Canar (Llergo-López and Riera-Mora, 2010), Cornia Nou (Portillo et al.,
2014), Cova de Sa Parra (Yll, 2011), and Cap de Barbaria-II (Revelles
and Burjachs, 2015) were chosen, taking into account anthracological
(Picornell-Gelabert, 2012) and pollen analyses conducted in archaeological contexts (Fig. 1).
3.1. Minorca
The three sequences studied on the island of Minorca are, ﬁrst, Es
Grau, which is particularly well dated; second, Algendar, which was
the subject of a high-resolution analysis; and, third, Cala'n Porter,
which is an incomplete sequence that includes, nevertheless, the moment of vegetation transition. These pollen sequences show an abrupt
change in the composition of the vegetation between 5825 and 4675

yr cal BP (Table 3). During the ﬁrst two-thirds of the Holocene, the vegetation landscape was largely dominated by Buxus, Juniperus, Ephedra,
and Thymelaea, accompanied by deciduous tree species (mainly Corylus,
Quercus deciduous, and Tilia; Figs. 2, 3, and 4; Table 4). In contrast, the
last third of the Holocene is dominated by wild olive (Olea), oaks
(Quercus evergreen type), mastic (Pistacia cf. lentiscus), heathers (Erica
spp.), and rockroses (Cistus spp., Figs. 3 and 4). However, since the M7
event (c. 7.2 cal kyr BP; Fig. 9), before the sudden transition, changes
in the vegetation composition are identiﬁed, and they can be connected
with the global trend towards an increase in drought (Bar-Matthews et

Ayalon, 2011; Pérez-Sanz et al., 2013; Chabaud et al., 2014; Donges et
al., 2015). It is possible to observe this tendency through the decrease
of Corylus and Buxus and the simultaneous increase of Juniperus, Ephedra, and Thymelaea (Figs. 2, 3, and 4). An accentuation of driest environments is also noted from c. 6.2 to 5.9 cal kyr BP (M6/B4 event; Figs. 2, 4,
and 9), and it is associated with the highest representation of taxa such
as cf. Juniperus, while Buxus begins to decline.
3.2. Majorca
The palynological sequence studied in Majorca is located on the
Albufera of Alcúdia (Fig. 1; Burjachs et al., 1994). The stratigraphic
framework is constrained and did not permit the development of an
age-depth model to precisely interpret the timing of the vegetation
changes during the Holocene (Fig. 5). However, the results suggest a
sudden shift around c. 4900 cal yr BP (Table 3), where the predominance of Juniperus, Ephedra, Quercus spp., Corylus, and Buxus changed towards the prevalence of wild olive (Olea), pines (Pinus), and oaks
(evergreen Quercus). The beginning of this landscape change occurred
after the M6 event (c. 6.2 cal kyr BP; Fig. 9), especially with the fall in
Juniperus/Ephedra and the rise of evergreen Quercus and Pistacia.

Two palynological sequences have been studied on this island (Yll et

the Prat de Vila sequence (Figs. 1 and 6) because it is the best dated
(Table 3). This island, along with Formentera (without natural pollen
records to date), constitutes the southernmost part of the archipelago,
with a clear thermo-Mediterranean bioclimatic domain. It presents different vegetation communities and a distinctive landscape evolution,
compared to the northernmost Balearics islands (Majorca and Minorca).
At the beginning of the middle Holocene, around 8000 cal yr BP, the vegetation landscape was dominated by oaks (Quercus spp.), pines (probably Pinus halepensis), and some deciduous arboreal species (Corylus,
Alnus, etc.), whereas during the Late Holocene the vegetation was

dominated by pines and herbaceous plants (NAP; Fig. 6). Juniperus,
Buxus, Olea, and Ephedra are signiﬁcantly less represented in Ibiza
than in the Gymnesian Islands. It must be highlighted that the synchrony of vegetation changed with recognized climatic events (Fig. 9), especially after the dry/cold M7 event (c. 7.4 cal kyr BP), where a decline in
Quercus spp. and a simultaneous increase in Pinus is observed, until the
M6 event (c. 6.2 cal kyr BP; Fig. 9). After this arid phase, a period characterized by the dominance of evergreen Quercus began, with a maximum peak around 4.7 cal kyr BP. From this period, the values of
Quercus spp. decreased while Pinus values simultaneously increased.

From 3.7 cal kyr BP, a major change in the composition of vegetation occurred, probably related to the anthropization of Ibiza and the effects of
the post-M4 dry event (Fig. 9).
4. Composition of vegetation during the Holocene
It is remarkable that before humans arrived on these islands, Majorca and Minorca (Gymnesian Islands) had signiﬁcantly different landscape compositions relative to Ibiza and Formentera (Pityusic Islands)
and the nearby Iberian coast. During the ﬁrst part of the Holocene, the
northern island landscapes were basically composed of endemic box
(Buxus cf. balearica), Mediterranean junipers (Juniperus cf. phoenicea, J.
cf. oxycedrus), some oaks (Quercus deciduous and evergreen type),
and a small presence of pines (Pinus). Between 5825 and 4675 cal yr
BP (more precisely dated in Es Grau to around 5350 cal yr BP; Table
3), the composition of the plant landscape changed abruptly, becoming
a maquia-type landscape with the presence of wild olive and evergreen
oaks (Quercus cf. coccifera, Q. cf. ilex, Q. cf. suber), which still remain at
present. Meanwhile, the vegetation composition in Ibiza was similar
to that of the nearby Iberian continental coast (only about 100 km
away), where Pinus and Quercus were predominant. Likewise, vegetation changes occurred more gradually than on the Gymnesian Islands
(e.g. Elx site in Carrión et al., 2012).
Palaeobotanical data (Figs. 7 and 8) obtained from archaeological excavations reinforce the concept of human impact on landscapes from
the ﬁrst permanent occupation. Thus, by comparing pollen data obtained in archaeological contexts with those obtained from natural sites, we
ﬁnd a dominance of the same taxa (Fig. 7). In the archaeological sediments, signiﬁcant quantities of ruderal and crops taxa are found,

suggesting disrupted environments around the sites from the Early
Bronze Age (Naviform period). Besides, anthracological data (Fig. 8),
with the same predominance of taxa identiﬁed in the pollen analysis,
further indicate uniformity in the exploitation of taxa existing in the
landscape over time (from the Bronze Age to Romanization): Naviform,
Talayotic, and post-Talayotic cultures.
It is also noteworthy that anthracology revealed the presence of taxa
that are difﬁcult to determine through pollen analysis due to low conservation or the dispersal of the pollen, especially, ﬁg tree (Ficus carica),
Clematis lianas, laurel (Laurus nobilis), lavender (Lavandula sp.), and
myrtle (Myrtus communis) (Picornell-Gelabert, 2012; Fig. 8).
5. Human settlements and associated ecological changes
The Balearic archipelago was the last in the Mediterranean to be colonized by humans. Despite numerous studies focusing on the arrival of
the ﬁrst humans in these Western Mediterranean islands, the dates remain highly uncertain (Ramis et al., 2002; Alcover, 2008). At present,
one radiocarbon date for ovicaprid bone associated with Bell-Beaker
pottery, dated to 4327 ± 62 cal yr BP (calendric age) or 2470–2270
cal yr BC (95.4% probability) (Aramburu-Zabala and MartínezSánchez, 2015), can be accepted as the oldest trace of human
occupation.
Importantly, the abrupt change in vegetation composition in the
Gymnesian Islands occurred between 5825 and 4675 cal yr BP (Table
3) and thus before the ﬁrst documented human presence on the islands.
Further evidence of this mismatch between landscape changes and
human impacts is provided by the record of the extinction of the only
two autochthonous small mammals (Bover and Alcover, 2008). Eliomys

morpheus (=Hypnomys morpheus) and Asoriculus hidalgoi (=Nesiotites
hidalgoi), which inhabited these islands, probably disappeared c. 6715
cal yr BP and c. 4869 cal yr BP, respectively, clearly before the arrival
of the ﬁrst humans.
On the other hand, the extinction of the unique large fauna
of the Gymnesian Islands—the endemic goat-like deer Myotragus
balearicus—was likely associated with the arrival of human societies
on Majorca and Minorca, and occurred later than the aforementioned
sudden vegetation change (Alcover et al., 1999; Bover and Alcover,

2003). Simultaneously, the Gymnesian Islands had an atypical plant
community based on boxwood and hazel, signiﬁcantly different from
the plant communities of Ibiza, an island lacking large fauna. It may be
said that Myotragus played a role in shaping this vegetation. For example, the scarce importance of pines (Pinus) on the Gymnesian Islands,
which differs from Ibiza (which means ‘island of pines’ in Phoenician),
is noteworthy. Does this suggest that seedling pines were a preferred
food for goat-like deer rather than junipers? Moreover, it is difﬁcult to
understand how this goat-like deer became extinct due to climatic

change—without taking into account the competition of humans or
other animals—considering it had survived since the Pliocene, having
experienced many different climate changes. Some conjectures can be
made, such as an epidemic disease that spread through contact with
other animals brought by humans (MacPhee and Marx, 1997; Bover
and Alcover, 2008), or other situations, such as over-depredation
(Diamond, 1989; Costa-Ribas, 2000). In any case, the debate about the
cause, or combination of causes, of the extinction of the Myotragus remains open, along with proper dating of human arrival on the
archipelago.
Furthermore, anthropogenic pollen indicators (Behre, 1986; Brun,
2011) could be helpful for clarifying the entrance of humans on these
islands, but these taxa are naturally common throughout the Holocene,
before and after human arrival (Figs. 2–6; Cerealia-type Cannabaceae,
Juglans, Vitis, Plantago, Asphodelus, Rumex, Urticaceae, located to the
right of the diagrams). However, they could have become more abundant after human colonization and with the occurrence of new animals
and crops brought by humans (Fig. 7).
6. Climate interpretation of vegetation evolution
First, deliberately avoiding deterministic climatic assumption, this
study aims to demonstrate the existence of natural changes in vegetation composition on the Balearic Islands before the arrival of the ﬁrst
humans. Indeed, humans were not responsible for the transformation
of plant landscapes during the ﬁrst two-thirds of the Balearic Holocene.
Thus, the curves in Figs. 9 and 10 show that environmental moisture
(mesic trees) had a tendency to decrease throughout the Holocene,
while shrubs (indicating more arid conditions) rose. This is interpreted

as a tendency towards minor rainfall and an increase in seasonality. All
shrubs present in the Balearics are well adapted to summer dryness.
Nevertheless, in the Gymnesian Islands, the mesic trees were more
abundant than shrubs until the 4.3 event (Figs. 9 and 10), while in the
Pityuses shrubs dominated earlier, since 7.2 cal kyr BP (M7, Fig. 11a).
North–south differences are thus clearly evidenced.
Moreover, it is possible to establish a link between the minimum
values of mesic trees and global cooling episodes (Bond et al., 1997;
Mayewski et al., 2004; Frigola et al., 2007) associated with greater aridity in the Mediterranean (Jalut et al., 2000; Fletcher et al., 2010). These
correlations are quite obvious, especially for the major events at 8.2,
5.9, and 4.3 (Carozza et al., 2015), but also for the minor events at 9.5/
9.2, 7.5/7.3, 2.9/2.7, and 1.55/1.38 cal kyr BP (Fig. 9) (Bond et al., 1997;
Bar-Matthews et al., 1999; Cacho et al., 2001; Frigola et al., 2007;
Fletcher et al., 2010; Fletcher and Zielhofer, 2013; Rasmussen et al.,
2014; Donges et al., 2015). Therefore, it is evident that these global climate events directly inﬂuenced the composition and evolution of the
vegetation of these islands. Similarly, forest ﬁres (charcoal in Fig. 11b)
had a visibly natural origin before the arrival of the ﬁrst humans and
can be correlated with global climate events, especially those taking
place at 8.2, 5.9, and 4.3 cal kyr BP (Burjachs and Expósito, 2015).
The date of the human colonization of these islands during the
Chalcolithic period coincides with the 4.3 climatic event, while the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age synchronizes with the 2.8
event. Likewise, the 1.4 event correlates with the end of the Western
Roman Empire (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11b). It is logical to suppose that
these are not coincidences, and that climate events are important variables to consider in historical studies since they can promote or accelerate social changes.

and blue bars to Minorca events (Frigola et al., 2007). The yellow bar shows the range of the ﬁrst human presence.

In the nearby continental areas, zones with local substrates and climates similar to the Gymnesian Islands do not show these abrupt
changes. The sequences from Amposta and Torreblanca (Dupré et al.,
1994; Pérez-Obiol et al., 2011) reﬂect ecosystems absorbing the disturbances. The pollen data suggest that this could be because many mesic
forests are present in the region, even in ecotonic habitats. For example,
Pinus sylvestris or deciduous Quercus, which prior to the Middle Holocene developed at a lower elevation than at present, were simply
displaced with increased seasonality. In any case, the trends identiﬁed
in the Balearic palaeoenvironmental records do not seem to be reﬂected
in the continental ones.
The Pityusic Islands do not show correlating abrupt changes, and the
starting point appreciated in the changing trends is quite different. The
Middle Holocene climate change affected xeric communities that were
already established. The precipitation changes allowed the continuation
of the woody xeric landscapes. If we consider the nearby semi-arid regions of the continent, the San Rafael sequence in Almería
(Pantaleón-Cano et al., 2003; Carrión et al., 2012) and Cabo de Gata
(Burjachs and Riera, 1996; Jalut et al., 2000) shows an abrupt vegetation
change after the Holocene optimum. A radical landscape transformation
was produced by the establishment of the steppe conditions and persists today. This fact is related to a threshold phenomenon: the mean
annual precipitation is less than 250 mm and does not facilitate the
spread and development of woody formations, which is not appreciable
in the landscape trends of Ibiza.
7. Conclusions
Based on the examination of the available chronological,
palaeoenvironmental, and archaeobotanical data, the main ﬁndings of
this study are as follows:
i) Substantial differences existed between the palaeovegetation of
the Gymnesian Islands (northeast Balearic archipelago) and the
Pityusic Islands (southwest Balearic archipelago). Before the arrival of the ﬁrst humans, the vegetation and fauna in the
Gymnesian Islands were in equilibrium with the climate during
the ﬁrst two-thirds of the Holocene.
ii) Regarding palaeovegetation, there are good correlations
between the data from natural sites and the data from archaeological excavations.

iii) Each global and rapid climatic event during the Holocene
corresponded to steps in the evolution of vegetation on the
islands. With the current state of available radiometric and palynological data, abrupt vegetation changes are observed at 5200
cal yr BP in S′Albufera d'Alcúdia (Majorca), at 5825 cal yr BP in
Cala'n Porter (Minorca), at 5350 cal yr BP in Es Grau (Minorca),
and at 4675 cal yr BP in Algendar (Minorca).
iv) Some changes took place before the permanent occupation of
these islands by human societies. Further studies based on
chronostratigraphy are needed to discriminate the anthropogenic and climatic origins of these vegetation changes occurring between the Middle and Late Holocene.
v) Different pollen types commonly used as ‘anthropogenic indicators’ are not relevant for the studied natural sites since they are
found before and after human colonization of the Balearic
Islands, and the percentages are similar.

New multidisciplinary research could produce more accurate
knowledge about vegetation changes linked to climate and anthropic
factors during the Holocene in the Balearic Islands.
