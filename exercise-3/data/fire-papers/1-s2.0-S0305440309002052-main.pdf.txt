The consumption of small prey dates back to the Plio-Pleistocene chronologies in some African sites.
However, the systematic acquisition and consumption of small prey in the pre-Upper Palaeolithic times
is still a highly debated topic in Europe. Although the utilization of leporids has been recorded in several
pre-Late Pleistocene European sites, the evidence of bird consumption is not as common for these
periods. Nevertheless, Level XI (MIS 6) of Bolomor Cave has clear diagnostic elements to document the
acquisition and use of birds (Aythya sp.) for food in the form of: (1) cutmarks on bones of both the front
and hind limb; (2) presence of burning patterns on the extremities of the bones (areas of the skeleton
with less meat); and (3) human toothmarks on limb bones. The capture of birds is classiﬁed as quickﬂying game in the archaeological sites. The acquiring of fast-running (mostly lagomorphs) and quickﬂying small prey requires a sophisticated technology and involves obtaining and processing ways
different from those used for large- and medium-sized animals. From this perspective, the aim of this
paper is to examine possible patterns in the processing sequence of birds from Level XI of Bolomor Cave
and to improve the data on their butchery and human consumption in the Middle Pleistocene of Iberian
Peninsula.

1. Introduction
Although several studies have used bird remains to determine
the time of site occupation and past environmental conditions, too
little attention has been given to the cultural signiﬁcance of bird
remains in the sites. Avian remains may have been ignored
because some researchers have assumed that birds contribute
little energy to the human diet (because of their low fat-to-lean
ratio) or that the technology required for their obtaining is too
complex and sophisticated for pre-Upper Palaeolithic chronologies. A potential problem is that the activities of anthropogenic
processing are unlikely to leave telltale physical evidence on all
bones (Lyman, 1994; Laroulandie, 2001; Steadman et al., 2002).
Furthermore, there is an additional problem. The use of the hands
or teeth as a tool for the immediate consumption of small prey
seems to be a possibility. The smaller the prey, less need there is
for the use of stone tools, and consequently, less evidences of

human activity on the bones is likely to be observed. In these
cases, the identiﬁcation of other characteristics that identify
anthropogenic processing on skeletal remains, such as human
toothmarks, breakage or burning should be considered before
ruling out the human groups as responsible for the accumulations.
Ericson (1987) asserted that bird bones from archaeological sites
cannot be considered the result of human activity unless obvious
anthropogenic modiﬁcations are present or that the species does
not naturally occupy the site (implying human transport). Vigne
and Marinval-Vigne (1983) used burning patterns on speciﬁc
skeletal parts to identify the human activities related to birds. On
the other hand, several authors argued that the skeletal representation is also a valid criterion to identify the origin of avian
accumulations (humans or raptors) (Mourer-Chauviré, 1979, 1983;
Vilette, 1983; Bramwell et al., 1987; Dı́ez et al., 1995). For these
researchers, the abundance of coracoids, humeri and femuri is
related to the human activities and, on the contrary, the abundance of the distal elements (tarsometatarsi and carpometacarpi)
is associated with the accumulations made by bird of prey.
Diagnostic evidences of human consumption have been identiﬁed on bird remains in several sites of Upper Palaeolithic and
Holocene chronologies (Eastham, 1986; Vilette, 1999; Steadman

and Intoh, 1994; Dı́ez et al., 1995; Cassoli and Tagliacozzo, 1997;
Gotfredsen, 1997; Higgins, 1999; Laroulandie, 2000, 2003, 2004,
2005a; Louchart and Soave, 2002; Steadman et al., 2002; inter alia).
However, little evidence of anthropogenic processing marks on
bird remains in the pre-Upper Palaeolithic times has been documented. So far, the older evidences on avian remains were identiﬁed in the Early Pleistocene of Sima del Elefante (Spain) (Huguet,
2007) and of Dursunlu (Turkey) (Güleç et al., 2009). At the Sima del
Elefante site, one cutmark on a proximal metaphysis of a large
sized-bird radius was observed at Level TE9a. In Dursunlu, several
incisions on distal metatarsus of a large bird were also documented. In more recent chronologies, an anthropogenic use on
Pyrrhocorax graculus bones was suggested in the ‘‘acheulean cabin’’
of the Lazaret in France (Bouchud, 1969). This study was based on
the spatial distribution of the bird remains, which are more
abundant inside the cabin. Nevertheless, this distribution has been
the subject of debate. According to Villa (1983), this phenomenon
is due to the natural formation process at Level V of the site. Some
species, such as crows and pigeons, are known to nest on the wall
of the caves and their bones are frequently found in karstic
contexts. It is possible that some of these birds died from natural
causes and others may have been brought by birds of prey (Bubo
bubo) in form of pellet or by carnivores (Vulpes vulpes, Felis silvestris or Lynx spelaea) that occasionally inhabited the cavity
(Lumley et al., 2004). However, cutmarks on one Columba livia
right humerus have been identiﬁed at UA 25 of Lazaret cave
(Lumley et al., 2004; Roger, 2004). On the other hand, the bird
accumulations in the Middle Pleistocene of the Áridos site (Spain)
were interpreted by Mourer-Chauviré (1980) as the result of
human hunting. However, the avian skeletal representation of this
site is not biased (Mourer-Chauviré, 1980) and therefore, the
interpretation of bird accumulation by hominids could be
problematic. In these cases, the identiﬁcation of other diagnostic
elements of anthropogenic processing on skeletal remains should
be considered.
In more recent chronologies, incisions have been noted on
Aquila chrysaetos phalanges in the Mousterian site of Pech de l’Aze
in France (Mourer-Chauviré, 1975; Soressi et al., 2008) and at
Mousterian Level A of Grotta di Fumane in Italy (Fiore et al., 2004).
According to Fiore and colleagues, the cutmarks on one phalanx of
a golden eagle were probably produced when the talon, or its
keratin sheath, was being removed, possibly for use as an ornament. Also, cutmarks on Cygnus cygnus remains were recovered at
Mousterian Level XV from Baume de Gigny in France (MourerChauviré, 1989). In Grotte de l’Hortus (France) anthropogenic processing marks on bird bones were not documented, however,
statistical analysis of avian remains by Mourer-Chauviré (1972)
suggested that Neanderthals were hunting birds.
From the above it is clear that the systematic acquisition and
consumption of avian prey during pre-Upper Palaeolithic times
is still a highly debated topic in Europe (Brugal and Desse,
2004).
In Bolomor Cave, the consumption of small prey is common
throughout the entire stratigraphic sequence. At this site, cutmarks on leporid bones (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are documented
repeatedly from MIS 9 to MIS 5e (Blasco, 2006; Sanchis Serra and
Fernández Peris, 2008). Anthropogenic processing marks are also
observed on tortoise remains (Testudo hermanni) at Level IV
(Blasco, 2008) and on one swan humerus (Cygnus olor) at Level
XII (Blasco, 2006). This paper aims to add available data on the
consumption and butchery of birds at Level XI in Bolomor Cave.
Level XI is one of the levels, within the stratigraphic sequence of
the site, which presents the highest percentage of very smallsized animals in relation to ungulates and allows us to examine
possible patterns of bird consumption.

2. Bolomor Cave
Bolomor Cave is located on the southern slope of the Valldigna
valley, approximately 2 Km southeast of the town of Tavernes
(Valencia, Spain) (Fig. 1). The site is a karstic rock shelter in the
Monduver Mountain, which was opened around 500 Ky, when the
Bolomor Ravine, in which it is located, was eroded. The cave is
situated approximately 100 m above sea level and northeast; the
coast runs almost perpendicular to the valley. The sedimentary
sequence of Bolomor Cave consists mainly of allochthonous
material of colluvial origin. In addition to these deposits, there are
other autochthonous sediments of gravitational origin from the
roof subsidence, due to tectonics or weathering processes. Seventeen geoarchaeological levels have been identiﬁed (Fumanal, 1995).
Level XI consists of a clayey sediment with subangular limestone
clasts. The sedimentary characteristics display a marked brecciation
to the east due to the constant precipitation that produces the drip
line of the cave. The karstic deposit of Bolomor Cave has been dated
by amino acid racemization (AR) and thermoluminescence (TL) to
between MIS 9 and MIS 5e (Fernández Peris, 2007). Levels are
numbered from the top of the deposit. Several TL dates have been
obtained: 121  18 Ky for Level II, 225  34 Ky for Level XIII and
233  35 Ky for Level XIV. AR dates have also been made:
228  53 Ky for Level XIII and 525  125 Ky for Level XVII (Fig. 1).
The fauna from Bolomor Cave includes 20 species of macromammals. The biostratigraphic sequence is mainly characterized by
the presence of Hemitragus cedrensis, Hemitragus bonali, Equus
ferus, Cervus elaphus and Dama sp. and by more speciﬁc records at
certain times of other species such as Megaloceros giganteus, Sus
scrofa, Macaca sylvana, Equus hydruntinus, Bos primigenius, Stephanorhinus hemitoechus, Paleoloxodon antiquus, Hippopotamus
amphibius and Castor ﬁber. The presence of carnivores in the cave is
sporadic, however fossil remains of Ursus arctos, Ursus tibetanus,
Canis lupus, Panthera leo, Lynx pardina, Vulpes vulpes and Meles
meles have been recovered (Martı́nez Valle, 2001; Blasco, 2006;
Sarrión and Fernández Peris, 2006; Blasco, 2008; Blasco et al.,
2008). The fauna from Level XI includes 12 species and among
these, Oryctolagus cuniculus and Aythya sp. are common. It is
important to point out that in contrast to the rest of the levels; the
small preys from Level XI represent more than half of the identiﬁed
species.
The lithic industry recovered from Bolomor Cave is classiﬁed as
a Middle Palaeolithic techno-complex. The used raw materials
consist of ﬂint, limestone and quartzite, which come from marine,
colluvial and ﬂuvial stones from the immediate area around the site
and from areas further aﬁeld up to 15 Km from the site (Fernández
Peris, 2007). The Level XI industry mainly consists of variously
retouched pieces, small tools (scrapers and denticulates) and
sporadic ﬂakes of ﬂint.
The investigations carried out to date at the site have yielded the
remains of combustion structures at Levels II, IV, XI and XIII. At
Level XI, seven hearths have been excavated. These showed an
average depth of 50 mm and an average diameter of 1.1 m. To date,
seven human bones and dental fragments have been recovered
from Bolomor Cave. Their morphology is compatible with those
from the Middle Pleistocene (Arsuaga et al., 2001).
3. Methodology
Level XI faunal analysis of Bolomor Cave was carried out
following standard archaeozoological methods (Lyman, 1994; Reitz
and Wing, 1999) and includes all fossil material from the 2007 to
2008 excavation seasons. Currently, the rest of species from Level XI
are being studied. Anatomical, taxonomic and modiﬁcation details
were recorded.

To assess completeness of the sample, number of identiﬁed
specimens (NISP), minimum number of elements (MNE), minimum
number of individuals (MNI) and skeletal survival rate (Brain, 1981;
Lyman, 1994) have been calculated. Skeletal survival rate estimates
the proportion between the elements recovered and those expected (Brain, 1969). For the calculation of this, the following formula
was used: % survivali ¼ MNE  100/number of elementi in the
animal skeleton  MNI.
The breaks on bird remains were analyzed and classiﬁed as
either being old (at or near the time of deposition) or new (during
or after excavation) (Steadman et al., 2002). The outline (transverse,
curved/V-shaped, longitudinal) and the fracture angle (oblique,
right, mixed) were analyzed.
Surface alterations generated by the biological agents were
treated at both macroscopic and microscopic level. For the microscopic study an Olympus SZ11 (magniﬁcation up to 110) and ESEM
(FEI QUANTA 600) were used. Damage observed on the bird
remains included cutmarks, bone breakage, human toothmarks and
burning.
The incisions are the only type of cutmark identiﬁed. The scrapes
and chopmarks are not documented (Binford, 1981; Potts and
Shipman, 1981; Shipman, 1983; Shipman and Rose, 1983; Shipman
et al., 1984a). The incisions are striations with a linear outline of
variable length, width, and depth. The incisions have a V-shaped
section and display internal microstriation (Potts and Shipman,
1981). In some cases, Hertzian cones (Bromage and Boyde, 1984),
shoulder effects and barbs (Shipman and Rose, 1983) were observed.

The analysis of cutmarks took into account the number of striations,
location on the anatomical element, distribution over the surface
(isolated, clustered, crossed), orientation regarding the longitudinal
axis of the bone (oblique, longitudinal, transverse) and delineation
(straight or curved). Maximum and minimum lengths were
measured in millimetres. The action performed (deﬂeshing, disarticulation, etc.) were recorded when it was possible to distinguish
(Laroulandie, 2000, 2001).
Burning was also identiﬁed. The bones brought to the ﬁre
experience different modiﬁcations: colour changes, cracking or
fractures and shrinkage (Shipman et al., 1984b; Guillon, 1986;
Buikstra and Swegle, 1989; Nicholson, 1993; inter alia). Perhaps, the
most obvious alteration is the changing of the natural coloration of
the bones. During exposure to burning, the skeletal remains progress through different colour stages (mainly from brown, black,
grey and to white) (Correia, 1997; Mayne, 1997). The burning
alterations documented on bird bones are here arranged in 6
degrees clusters according to colour (Stiner et al., 1995): (a) Grade
0: unburned bones; (b) Grade 1: the bone surface presents small
dots scattered brow; (c) Grade 2: brown stain more or less homogeneous across the bone surface; (d) Grade 3: the bone was charred. The colour is black; (e) Grade 4: grey stain. Occasionally veins
appear with bluish tones; and (f) Grade 5: the fossil appears
calcined. The colour is completely white.
The toothmarks identiﬁed on bird remains were mainly pits,
scores and crenulated edges. Measurements of toothmark damage
for pits were taken from stereoscopic and environmental scanning

electron microscope (ESEM) view as the maximum linear dimension
of each mark (Landt, 2007). The maximum breadth of each tooth pit
was also measured. Scoring marks were measured as the maximum
breadth of the scratch and tooth notches were measured following
Capaldo and Blumenschine (1994). These marks were compared
with the human toothmarks (Laroulandie, 2000, 2005b; Pérez
Ripoll, 2005; Lupo and Schmitt, 2005; Landt, 2007; Saladié, 2009)
and with the non-human predator marks (Mayhew, 1976; Korth,
1979; Andrews and Evans, 1983; Schmitt, 1995; Laroulandie, 2000;
Bochenski and Tornberg, 2003; Cruz, 2008; Bochenski et al., 2009).

Level XI provided 1047 faunal remains, of which 555 were
identiﬁed taxonomically (Table 1). Among the determinate bones at
a speciﬁc level, 469 (84.5%) belongs to small vertebrates (tortoises,
birds, ﬁshes and leporids). Although the consumption of small prey
seems to be a constant throughout the sequence of Bolomor Cave,
Level XI presents the highest proportion of small prey compared
with the ungulates.
Level XI of Bolomor Cave provided 202 bird remains. These
belong to the subfamily Anatinae, concretely to the genus Aythya.
The taxonomic identiﬁcation has been based mainly on the humeri,
tarsometatarsi and coracoids according to the criteria described by
Woelﬂe (1967). The MNE is 167, mostly represented by vertebrae
(34) and phalanges (20), while skull and ﬁbula are each represented
by one bone. The MNI is 8 established from the most common
element (coracoid) comparing paired elements and their size. All
the identiﬁed individuals are adults. The skeletal survival rate
assesses the proportion between the elements recovered and those
you would expect according to the MNI. This way, the obtained
anatomical representation is deemed more valid as an indicator of
the elements, which are absent from the sample, and suggests
whether biases are present in skeletal part representation. This
indicated a bias. The anatomical elements with the highest survival
are coracoid and tibiotarsus. By contrast, the bones with least
survival are ribs, vertebrae and ﬁbulae followed by the cranium and
the phalanges (Table 2).
The majority of the alterations observed on these bird remains
are anthropogenic. The relatively high occurrence of cutmarks on
bones (8.91%) indicates an association between the hominids and
birds. These were identiﬁed mainly on the coracoid, humerus,
femur and tibiotarsus (3) with a predominance of incisions on
diaphysis; none occurred on epiphyses. Incisions were also identiﬁed on the clavicle and radius (2), the ulna (1) and on the ischium
of the pelvic girdle (1). The interpretation of the activity involved

was made on the morphology, emplacement and distribution of
incisions (Table 3) (Fig. 2).
Surface damage caused during breakage of the bones was also
analyzed, but diagnostic elements of anthropogenic fracturing, as
for example percussion pits or percussion notches (Capaldo and
Blumenschine, 1994; Blumenschine and Selvaggio, 1988; Pickering
and Egeland, 2006), were not observed. Nevertheless, the fragmentation is present on bones of both the front and hind limbs,
predominantly on tibiotarsi and femori. Breakage was usually in
the form of transverse and curved/V-shaped fracture outlines
close the ends and oblique and mixed fracture angles. The
breakage near the ends is not common in non-anthropogenic or
post-burial contexts (Louchart and Soave, 2002; Laroulandie,
2005b). On the other hand, the curved/V-shaped fractures are
features of bird bone breakage in fresh (Dı́ez et al., 1995).
The incidence of burning was identiﬁed on 52.48% of bird
remains (Table 4). Except the ﬁbula, all the skeletal parts have this
modiﬁcation. The coracoid is the most affected element (10 bone
fragments) followed by the humerus (9), cervical vertebrae (8), and
the tibiotarsus (8). Grades 2 and 3 are the most abundant modiﬁcation types. Fifty bird remains were classiﬁed with Grade 3 and 41
with Grade 2. By contrast, Grades 1 and 5 are the worst represented
with only one element. Double colouration was also observed on
4.71% of the burned remains. This modiﬁcation was documented on
humerus (1), radius (1), ulna (1) and tibiotarsus (2) and was located
on the extremities of the bones. These variations of colour do not
coincide with the colourations described by Bennet (1999) for
bones burned after burial. In addition, the archaeostratigraphic
distribution of burned bird remains indicates that there are no
elements located below the hearth recovered at Level XI.
The toothmarks identiﬁed on the bird remains at Level XI match
up with the human toothmarks described by several authors (Laroulandie, 2000, 2005b; Pérez Ripoll, 2005; Lupo and Schmitt, 2005;
Landt, 2007; Saladié, 2009). These marks are small in size; they
appear near to broken edges and sometimes they describe longitudinal ﬁssures resulting from human gnawing. These marks are
often associated with peeling (Saladié, 2009). This association and

the breakage patterns might result from the skeletal element being
held between the teeth and bent during consumption. In some
cases, human toothmarks took the form of crenulated edges (Pérez
Ripoll, 2005) and frequently adhering ﬂakes are still attached to the
bone (Laroulandie, 2005b). At Level XI, human toothmarks were
observed mainly on limb bones; predominantly on the femur and
tibiotarsus (Table 5) (Fig. 3).
No carnivore toothmarks were observed on the bird remains. The
bone alterations did not coincide with those described in several
researches on raptors and carnivores accumulations (Mayhew, 1976;
Korth, 1979; Andrews and Evans, 1983; Bramwell et al., 1987;
Schmitt, 1995; Hockett, 1996; Bochenski and Tomek, 1997; Bochenski
et al., 1998; Laroulandie, 2000; Bochenski and Tornberg, 2003; Trapani et al., 2006; Cruz, 2008; Bochenski et al., 2009).
5. Discussion
The bird remains identiﬁed at Level XI of Bolomor Cave show
sufﬁcient evidence to attribute their presence to human activity
during the Middle Pleistocene (MIS 6). First, the avian species
identiﬁed at Level XI (Anatinae) do not naturally occupy the cave
(implying transport). Second, there was no evidence of carnivore
damage on the avian remains, and none of the bones shows signs of
having passed through the gut of a predator. Third, the analysis of
Level XI bones illustrates clear evidence on bird bones that documents human consumption in form of: (1) cutmarks on bones of
both the wing and leg; (2) burning pattern on the extremities of the
bones (areas of the skeleton with less meat); and (3) human
toothmarks on limb bones.
The evidence for anthropogenic interventions on the bones
relates to consumption of birds. However, ascertaining the method
of obtaining birds is a complex matter. Within the range of small
prey, Stiner (2001) distinguishes between slow-moving easy

collected types (mostly tortoises and shellﬁsh), fast-running
mammals (mostly lagomorphs) and quick-ﬂying animals (birds).
The hunting of fast-running and quick-ﬂying small prey involves
complex catchments ways and a sophisticated technology;
although Avery and Underhill (1986) pointed out that the obtaining
of sick, dying or dead seabirds in the South-African coast is easy
during the migration periods. On the other hand, the slow-moving
small animals are essentially gatherable or captured with limited
technology. Isaac and Crader (1981) consider that acquiring small
prey is closer to gathering than hunting. In any case, it is evident
that their capture requires techniques different from those used for
large and medium mammals. Ethnographic examples exist and
explain how some groups of hunter-gatherers use systems to hunt
birds as the use of traps, bird calls, nests control mechanisms or
even, clay balls thrown (Webster, 1834; Lévi-Strauss, 1992;
Emperaire, 2002; inter alia). There are also cases of birds being
caught after natural processes or catastrophes (deFrance, 2005).
The species belonging to the genus Aythya are medium-sized
diving ducks that live in marshes and lakes with a depth of
approximately one metre. These animals are skittish and to escape
danger, they tend to immerse in the water. Currently, these birds
are migratory and breed in temperate areas of Europe and Asia.
They are gregarious birds, forming large ﬂocks in winter (Stanevičius et al., 2008). Perhaps, this could be the best time for hunting.
However, with the archaeological data currently available, we
cannot know the moment or the technique used by the Bolomor
hominids to obtain birds. We can only rule out one option in the
case of Level XI of Bolomor Cave: the fact that all the recovered
individuals are adults indicates that visiting the nests was not
considered a viable means of taking this species.
The cutmarks on Aythya remains indicate that they were processed to be consumed. The location of the incisions on the bone
remains enables us to reconstruct how they were butchered. The

The double colourations are located on the same surface of the bone and these have been analyzed according to the same clusters of colour grades.

cutmarks show that the main action carried out was deﬂeshing.
Incisions or sawing marks that would allow us to identify disarticulation have not been documented on the distal ends of bones. At
Level XI of Bolomor Cave, the percentage of cutmarks on the avian
remains is high (8.91%). The absence of the incisions in the 91.08% of
the bones can be explained by different reasons:
(1) It must be taken into account that when meat removal is
carried out, the lithic tool does not always come into contact
with the bone.
(2) The size of the prey makes the use of tools unnecessary for
consumption. After tearing apart, direct use of hands and teeth
would be the best way to remove the meat and fat from the
bones. The proof of this is the human toothmarks observed on
some bones.
In general, the percentage of cutmarks documented at Level XI
coincides with other archaeological assemblages (Lyman, 1994) and
with the experimental observations on birds (Laroulandie, 2001,
2005b).
The butchering and disarticulation of birds may also introduce
breakage patterns that differ from those relating to marrow
extraction. For Higgins (1999), if patterns of breakage reﬂect meat
removal or disarticulation, these could be associated with the origin
and insertion of the major muscle groups on the examined bones.
At Level XI of Bolomor Cave, 57.42% of the recovered remains are
fragmented. This has enabled us to observe patterning in the
absence of extremities of some bones. Perhaps, the best example is
the one observed on femuri or tibiotarsi. For instance, major
muscles insert on the proximal end of the tibiotarsus, with the
muscle mass decreasing distally. It is likely that butchering would
result in the fragmentation or destruction of the proximal end of
this bone (Higgins, 1999). At Level XI, the bone fragments belonging
to the tibiotarsus mainly correspond to the distal part of this bone.
Therefore, this absence of proximal tibiotarsi and the lack of ends
on other bird bones may also indicate butchering and disarticulation activities. Laroulandie (1998, 2005a,b) conclude the same in
the Magdalenian sites of Eglises and La Vache in France, and
Louchard and Soave (2002) also attribute the absence of ends to

human activities in the Magdalenian and Azilian assemblages of Taı̈
2 (France). Nevertheless, we must take into account that the
structural properties of bones sometimes favour the disappearance
of certain elements or anatomical portions (Livingston, 1989; Higgins, 1999; Dirrigl, 2001; Cruz and Elkin, 2003). This should be
considered in faunal assemblages where the use of ﬁre is documented, as bones, which are subjected to heat, become weaker and
can even be destroyed (Shipman et al., 1984b; Guillon, 1986;
Buikstra and Swegle, 1989; Nicholson, 1993; Stiner et al., 1995; inter
alia). Even the remnants are so fragmented that species identiﬁcation is pretty well impossible in most cases.
On the other hand, one of the objectives of intentional anthropogenic breakage is to extract the bone marrow contained in the
bones. However, the most distinctive and best-known characteristic of avian bones is their pneumatization, i.e., the replacement of
marrow by air. The extent of pneumatization varies taxonomically
and there are vast differences among closely related species (Bellairs and Jenkin, 1960). Confusion exists regarding the marrow
status of bird bones and the relationship of the presence of marrow
to pneumaticity. Often, there it is a common idea that all avian
bones are hollow and, therefore, pneumatic. However, many bird
bones are marrow-ﬁlled (for example, femur, tibiotarsus or several
cervical and caudal vertebrae). Furthermore, Hogg (1984) recognized in a study of the pneumaticity of fowl bones that only the
humerus is totally pneumatic. At Level XI of Bolomor Cave, the
femur and the tibiotarsus represent 63.21% of the total fragmented
bones. These bones are the most important skeletal elements as
regards bone marrow content within the avian skeleton (Giardina,
2006). From this perspective, it is logical that they would be broken
into with the objective of extracting the bone marrow. Besides, the
consumption of the cartilage and/or marrow may also contribute to
the under-representation of the articulations ends in the bird
assemblage (Lefèvre and Pasquet, 1994). These observed breakage
patterns rule out the possibility of perimortem fractures during the
prey obtaining (Mameli, 2003).
In order to fracture the bird bones, the human groups of Level XI
probably used their teeth, as no diagnostic elements of fracturing
by active or passive percussion have been identiﬁed such as
percussion pits, percussion notches, impact ﬂakes or counterblows.

However, various human toothmarks associated with the fracture
edges are observed and in some cases, they actually form crenulated edges or peeling. Furthermore, it must be taken into account
that before females lay eggs; their long bones are ﬁlled with
medullar bone, which functions as a calcium deposit for eggshell
production (Driver, 1982; Neer et al., 2002).
The bone breakage and cutmarks on bird remains from Level XI
are not concordant with the use of feathers or bones (Bouchud,
1953; Vilette, 1983; Dı́ez et al., 1995).
Most of the bird remains show signs of burning, although a few
instances of double colouring on the bones are documented

(4.71%). The double colorations are due to the fact that the entire
surface was not exposed to ﬁre with the same intensity. Some of
these modiﬁcations can be located on the same surface. Rosell
(2001) noted that this may occur when animals are cooked before
deﬂeshing. This happens because when the prey is placed on the
hearth for cooking, the portions of bone with minimal ﬂesh
covering receive more intense heat, resulting in variable burning
effects reﬂected by high colour tonalities. Meanwhile, the portions
of the bone covered in meat maintain their original colour, and in
some occasions acquire low tonalities (Grades 1 and 2) in places
where there is a lesser amount of muscle mass present on the bone.

This phenomenon is also observed on bird bones at experimental
and archaeological level by Laroulandie (2000, 2005a). At Level XI
of Bolomor Cave, the highest grades of burning on bones with
double colouration coincide with the areas of the skeleton with less
muscle. Therefore, the highest grade of burning of the humerus is
observed on the head of the proximal joint, of the tibiotarsus on the
distal extremity and of the ulna and the radius on the distal part of
the ventral (palmar) surface. This type of evidence was also recorded in the Upper Magdalenian site of La Vache (France) (Laroulandie, 2005a) and at the Final Epigravettian levels of Grotta
Romanelli (Italy) (Cassoli and Tagliacozzo, 1997) where the presence of double colorations were interpreted as the result of birds
being cooked over a ﬁre or in burning embers. On these grounds, it
is possible that some of the Level XI birds had been cooked before
consumption.
On the other hand, the lowest grades of heat (Grades 1 and 2)
are relatively abundant in the assemblage (39.62%) and could
coincide with the light tones the bones acquire in areas that contain
more muscle or after exposure to lower heat intensities. Despite
this, 47.52% of the bird remains are not burned. This could indicate
that some birds were processed and consumed without being
cooked. In the same way, the abundance of bones with black tones
(47.17%) or with the highest grade of burning (8.49%) suggest the
option that some bones could have also been thrown onto the ﬁre
or embers once the meat and viscera have been removed. This
option could also explain the low proportion of some skeletal
elements in relation to the expected proportions in an entire
individual. The vertebrae and ribs are the least represented
elements at Level XI, however, they are the ones that show the
highest percentage of burning (around 80% are burned). In this
sense, it is possible that ﬁre removes bones, thereby biasing the
sample available for study.
In summary, it is possible that the preferred method for bird
processing at Level XI of Bolomor Cave was the cooking, although
occasionally the consumption could have been raw. The methods of
processing birds are more complex in recent chronologies where
a combination of techniques regarding the use of ﬁre has been
identiﬁed. This fact was recorded by Cassoli and Tagliacozzo (1997),
Steadman and Intoh (1994) and Steadman et al. (2002) at various
sites of Upper Palaeolithic and Holocene chronologies. These
authors suggest a combination of processing methods. These
techniques range from birds eaten raw to complex cooking techniques like the methods of birds wrapped in leaves and cooked in
underground ovens suggested in the case of the Fais Island sites
(Federated States of Micronesia) or of Kingdom of Tonga (islands in
the south-western Paciﬁc).
6. Conclusions
Level XI of Bolomor Cave has provided sufﬁcient evidence to
show proof of human consumption of birds (Aythya sp.) in the
Middle Pleistocene, during MIS 6. The diagnostic elements of
human activity identiﬁed on the avian remains allow us to establish
the processing sequence of these animals. There are numerous
ethnographic examples that show different systems to capture
birds. However, with the archaeological data currently available at
Level XI, we cannot identify the technique used by the hominids to
obtain these small animals. The birds were deﬂeshed using both
stone tools and teeth. Proof of this is the cutmarks and human
toothmarks documented on the avian remains. It is possible that
some bones were fractured when removing the meat. However, it
seems likely that most bone breakage was carried out intentionally
to reach the marrow inside the bones. The most fractured skeletal
elements at Level XI are those that have the highest bone marrow
content and those that register the largest number of human

2221

toothmarks. These toothmarks are associated with the fracture
edges on the bones and sometimes form crenulated edges or
peeling. The use of ﬁre for processing (cooking) is the most documented technique at Level XI. The highest grades of burning are
localised in areas of the skeleton with least muscle (extremities).
This could suggest that the birds were cooked prior to meat
removal. However, this method is not always used by hominids of
Level XI. There are also certain percentages of unburned bones in
the parts with less meat. That is, it is also possible for some birds to
be consumed when the meat is raw. Afterwards, some of the
remains may have been thrown onto the ﬁre or onto the embers
causing higher grades of burning to the sample and the possible
destruction of some elements.
In other levels of the stratigraphic sequence of Bolomor Cave,
the exploitation of small animals like lagomorphs (Oryctolagus
cuniculus), birds (Cygnus olor) and tortoises (Testudo hermanni) is
also documented (Blasco, 2006, 2008; Sanchis Serra and Fernández
Peris, 2008). In the future, it is possible that the stratigraphical
sequence of Bolomor Cave will provide enough data to discuss the
techniques of bird acquisition in this site and to compare the quick/
slow small prey incidence in the human groups’ palaeodiet during
the Middle Pleistocene.
