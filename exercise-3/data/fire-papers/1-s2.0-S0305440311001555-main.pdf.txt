Macroscopic examination, histomorphometry and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) are
applied to the analysis of burned bones from the early Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Elsham in Lincolnshire,
UK. These methods were undertaken to gain a greater understanding of pyre conditions from an
archaeological context and the effects of burning on bone microstructure. Sixteen samples were
employed for thin-section analysis while eight samples were used with FTIR. The results suggest that
these methods correspond well with macroscopic examination, though anomalies did occur. The techniques employed in this paper have demonstrated that the temperatures reached on the funerary pyres
at Elsham ranged from 600  C to over 900  C under oxidizing conditions.

1. Introduction
The early Anglo-Saxon period is known for its rich burial
assemblages and large inhumation and cremation cemeteries.
These cremation cemeteries are concentrated in eastern England,
among the largest and best studied are Spong Hill, Norfolk,
Sancton I, East Riding of Yorkshire and Loveden Hill, Lincolnshire
(Fennell, 1964; Timby, 1993; McKinley, 1994). Furthermore this
region holds the most evidence for the practice of cremation
funerary rites between the ﬁfth and seventh centuries AD, though
inhumation has a more generalised distribution. In the majority of
areas, inhumation and cremation were carried out alongside each
other. Unfortunately, cremated bones that were excavated from
these cemeteries have long been neglected on the basis that little
information could be extracted from these remains (Myres, 1947,
2). However, over the past twenty years interest in Anglo-Saxon
cremation cemeteries has signiﬁcantly increased. This new found
attention appears to have been a result of methodological
advances in biological anthropology to assess the demographic
and life history attributes of such sites. Generally, these studies
have failed to incorporate more technical analyses. A more

nuanced understanding of how the analysis of heat-induced
change in bone can provide valuable information about pyre
technology and the funerary process. Subsequently, the use of
these methods would allow a greater insight of the cremation
process and its effects on human bone and has been demonstrated
by studies of skeletal material from other periods and from
forensic contexts (Table 1).
A common method employed to assess pyre conditions is
macroscopic examination of cremated bone. The main focus of such
analysis explores the colour of bone to determine the temperature
range and oxidising conditions of the funerary pyre. Insufﬁcient
oxygen would have created a reducing, rather than oxidizing
atmosphere, thus the bone would have been charred and appear
blue to grey in colour as opposed to oxidizing conditions in which
the bone would turn a buff to white colour (McKinley, 2000, 405).
(Shipman et al. (1984), 312e313) devised ﬁve distinct groups based
on the heating stages of bone tissue and the resulting colours at
different temperatures ranging from pale yellow through brown,
black, bluish grey, light grey and white. Nonetheless, it has been
noted by a number of authors that colour is a poor criterion in
judging the degree of incineration and the examination of colour
alone cannot determine the attained temperature of a cremation
pyre as heat varied throughout the structure (Herrmann, 1977;
Thompson, 2004). Furthermore the colour of bone may have
changed after deposition in the ground (Taylor et al., 1995, 116).
More recently Munro et al. (2007) explicitly associated colour
change with temperature of burning. Most signiﬁcantly, Walker

bone, macroscopic and microscopic analyses need to be employed
in conjunction to gain a more comprehensive picture of pyre
conditions (Thompson, 2004; Walker et al., 2008, 134).

The use of histomorphometry was highlighted by Herrmann
(1977) and Bradtmiller and Buikstra (1984), who drew attention
to a number of structural changes that occurred as a result of the
burning process e although this has not been developed signiﬁcantly since. Together with macroscopic examination, thin-section
analysis is extremely useful as structural changes of cremated bone
can be observed at various stages of the cremation process. This can
provide a better sense of the temperature that funerary pyres
reached in a way that examining the colour of the remains alone
cannot. This method can also show how long a cadaver had been
left on a funerary pyre; for instance if high temperatures were
reached, though the corpse was only on the pyre for a limited
amount of time, the cortical bone underlying the periosteal surface
would show reduced organics while bone in the endosteal region
would show better preserved microstructure as this area of the
bone had not been exposed to such high temperatures (Walker
et al., 2008, 130). Conversely, the fragmentation, fracturing and
disturbance of bones on the pyre (as a result of possible tending)
would have caused the endosteal bone to have been directly
exposed to the ﬁre and would not necessarily be better preserved
than the periosteal surface (McKinley, 1989, 72). This has implications for the determination and interpretation of wealth or social
status in Anglo-Saxon communities that practised cremation rites.
It may be possible that they invested more resources, including
time and fuel, into the cremation process and burial of a prominent
member of the community. The major problems with this technique is the fragile nature of cremated bone which often crumbles
when attempting to cut thin-sections combined with the specialist
nature of the equipment and expertise required. These kinds of
issue may deter osteologists and archaeologists from carrying out
this method as it is prohibitively time consuming. (McKinley
(1994), 17) noted this problem when discussing the Spong Hill
material. Despite excluding the method from her study, the author
stated that it is possible to use this technique in conjunction with

archaeological material. This is supported by Herrmann’s (1977)
study that employed thin-section analysis with Iron Age
cremated bone samples.
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) has only
recently been applied to the analysis of cremated bones. FTIR
produces a spectrum from a given material based on the absorption
of infrared radiation. Key values from peaks along these spectra can
be used to create a number of ratios, including the Crystallinity

Index (CI) and the carbonate to phosphate ratio (C/P), which can
then be used to gain a greater understanding of temperature and
duration of the cremation process. The Crystallinity Index, or
‘splitting factor’, is the more common ratio, and is a measure of the
structure order of the crystals within a bone (Trueman et al. 2008).
When these crystals are heated they become larger and/or more
ordered (Stiner et al., 2001, 650). The C/P ratio decreases as
a consequence of the carbonate fraction decomposing at higher

temperatures (Thompson et al., 2009). The examination of these
ratios will allow for a complementary interpretation of funerary
activity when combined with examining thin-section micrographs,
with regards to the temperature and duration of a cremation. The
main reason for this is the increasing proportion of the inorganic
fraction following loss of the organics as a result of the cremation
process. (Thompson et al. (2009), 914) conducted a controlled
experiment to investigate the relationship between temperature of
burned bone and changes to the structure of the inorganic fraction
and concluded that FTIR can distinguish cremated bones from low
intensity and high intensity burnings. Interestingly, (Thompson
et al. (2009), 913) also observed that the disappearance of
collagen occurred at 700  C. This is noteworthy as other authors,

despite employing different methods, have noted that this is the
temperature when major changes occur to the bone structure
(Herrmann, 1977; Newesely, 1988; Nicholson, 1993; Thompson,
2004).
This paper aims to shed further light on early Anglo-Saxon
funerary ritual and pyre technology through the combined use of
histomorphometry and FTIR analysis, which is yet to be employed
in conjunction with cremated remains from this period. The use of
these methods will contribute to archaeologists’ understanding of
the efﬁciency of these techniques, especially with regards to
archaeological and modern material from unknown contexts. The
combined use of macroscopic examination, histomorphometry and
FTIR analysis have been carried out as the utilisation of histology is
rarely incorporated in studies examining other aspects of the
burning process, such as duration and temperature of the funerary
pyre, yet it could provide a great amount of information (Cunha
et al., 2009, 5).
2. Materials and methods
The samples selected for this study derive from the early AngloSaxon cremation cemetery of Elsham in North Lincolnshire, U.K.
(Webster and Cherry, 1977; Richards, 1987; Bond, 1996; Leahy,
2007) (Fig. 1). All Anglo-Saxon cremation sites are dated between
the ﬁfth and sixth centuries, tentatively extending into the seventh
century. The entire cemetery was excavated between 1975 and
1976, from which ﬁve hundred and seventy seven cremation
burials were recovered. The original bioarchaeological assessment
was conducted by Mary Harman in 1976 who explored
the biological age and sex of the community of the Elsham cemetery. However, as a result of the developments in biological
anthropology and more standardised recording techniques, a reassessment of the material was conducted by the ﬁrst author of this
paper. All individuals assessed in this paper were adults based on
McKinley’s age categories employed in the Sancton I and Spong Hill
reports (Timby, 1993, 289; McKinley, 1994, 19).
A total of three comparative thin-sections of burned bone were
prepared by Bhayro (2003) and micrographs of these slides were
taken by the primary author. These samples derived from
a deﬂeshed adult human femur from a modern anatomical specimen, though its origin is unknown. Each sample was subjected to
heating in a Lenton Eurotherm 902P furnace for 15 min at 300  C,
600  C and 900  C, respectively (Bhayro, 2003, 25). An advantage of

these temperatures is that they closely match those used in other
experimental burned bone studies. These comparative thinsections are stored in the slide collection in the Department of
Archaeology at the University of Shefﬁeld. Table 2 shows the details
of the three standardised categories employed in this study to
classify the changes to bone microstructure as a consequence of the
cremation process. These include less intensely cremated, intensely
cremated and completely cremated categories. The presence of
pyre and artefact debris was also recorded as further evidence of
temperature.
2.1. Thin-section analysis
Sixteen samples were chosen at random, all of which were taken
from single burials (Table 3). The only condition of this sampling
method was that the remains were taken from adult long bones as
these are the most suited to thin sectioning. These samples were
initially cleaned of any dirt that remained on the bone surface. The
colour of bone from each sample was recorded using Munsell soil
colour charts (Munsell, 2000). They were then placed into individual cubes of an ice cube container and a small quantity of LR
White resin mixed with a polymerisation accelerator (Agar Scientiﬁc) was poured into each individual cube ensuring that the bone

was covered. The container holding the samples was consequently
placed into a sink of cold water to counter the heat which was
produced as a result of the chemical reaction. Once the bone was
soundly embedded in the resin each sample was thin-sectioned
using a Leica SP 1600 saw microtome at a speed of 600RPM.
Sections were cut to either sixty, seventy ﬁve or one hundred
microns due to the fragile nature of the bone. Once cut, the
embedded thin-section was mounted between two glass slides.
Micrographs were then taken of the thin-sections to allow analyses
of the microstructure of the cremated bone. A Leitz LaborLux 12
Pols microscope was used so that the samples could be observed in
plane polarized and cross polarized light. Magniﬁcation remained
at 25 throughout the process. A Canon EOS300D camera was
utilised to capture images of the bone microstructure. The images
were then imported on to remote capture software. The microstructure of the archaeological samples was subsequently
compared with the experimental specimens, where temperature of
burning was known. Other factors such as the presence of pyre
debris and macroscopic colour of the bone were considered
throughout. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations were

employed in this study to gain a better understanding of pyre
temperatures during the early Anglo-Saxon period. The use of
histomorphometry also aims to show differential burning of the
body which may illuminate the position of the individual on the
pyre.
2.2. FTIR analysis
A total of eight samples were selected at random for this analysis, all of which derived from single burials. Samples were taken
from two inhumed individuals (EL76AK; EL76JO), three less
intensely cremated (EL75BB; EL75ES; EL76DH), one intensely
cremated (EL76PB) and two completely cremated (EL75MQ;
EL76NN) from the Elsham assemblage (Table 3). The colour of each
bone was recorded using Munsell soil colour charts (Munsell, 2000).
Each sample was taken using a scalpel from the periosteal surface
of the anterior distal third of a femoral diaphysis and was stored in
a sealed test tube as recommended by Thompson et al. (2010).
Inhumed samples, from the same anatomical locations, were used
as a control for the study. The FTIR-ATR method was used
throughout this study as it has been shown to be preferred to the

traditional FTIR-KBr procedure (Thompson et al., 2009). A Nicolet
5700 FTIR Spectrometer controlled by OMNIC 7.3 software was
used in this study. Spectra were recorded between 2000 cm1 and
400 cm1 at a resolution of 4 cm1 and an averaging of 16 scans.
Three replicate measurements were made on each sample. To avoid
contamination, the diamond stage was cleaned with propanol prior
to analysing each sample. After a background spectrum had been
collected, samples were, in turn, placed on to the diamond ATR
crystal. Once a sample was in place and covered the diamond stage
sufﬁciently, an adjustable clamp was tightened to ensure good
contact between the sample and the ATR crystal. Subsequently,
spectra were automatically recorded using the OMNIC software.
The application of FTIR analysis in this study aims to identify
discrete temperature variation between samples, which would not
be detected through the use of macroscopic and histomorphometric analysis alone.
3. Results
3.1. Thin-section analysis
The determination of temperature based on bone microstructure examination highlighted that eight of the samples were burnt
at a temperature of at least 900  C and thus fall in to the completely
cremated category (Figs. 3e5). This was displayed by the destruction of organic material and structure of the bone and the fusion of
hydroxyapatite crystals, which occurs between 700 and 800  C. The
fusion of crystals is visible by the disappearance of osteocyte
lacunae while the diameter of osteons decrease and the diameter of
Haversian canals increase in size (Mayne Correia, 2006, 279;
Fairgrieve, 2008, 136). Only two samples exhibit the complete loss
of microstructure which occurs at over 900  C, namely EL75BK and
EL76CA(a) (Figs. 2 and 3). The remaining six samples displayed
osteons, which are lost at around 900  C. This highlights that these
individuals were cremated on a pyre which reached temperatures
of at least 900  C.
The remaining eight samples display evidence of burning at
lower temperatures and were assigned to the intensely cremated
grouping. In all instances this was manifested by the clear presence
of osteons in at least one area of the bone section (Figs. 4e6). This
suggests a temperature of less than 900  C. When compared with
the experimental thin-sections it appears that these bone samples
from Elsham were cremated at temperatures between 600  C and
900  C.
Three of the samples, which were assigned to the intensely
cremated category, produced some interesting results. These
anomalies are worth investigating further. An intensely cremated
radius fragment was selected from burial EL75GA (Fig. 7). Under

plane polarized light the periosteal region and external cortical
bone displays no structure and suggests this area of the bone was
heated to temperatures of at least 900  C (Fig. 8). A section of the
inner cortical bone shows the presence of osteons, and the structure closely resembles that of the experimental section ﬁred at
600  C. However, the endosteum and surrounding area exhibit
fewer osteons and less organised structure, indicating the fusion of
hydroxyapatite crystals suggesting a temperature of 900  C.
Unfortunately a cross polarized micrograph of this sample was
unavailable for analysis. Over 50% of the bone microstructure has
been destroyed. A number of heat-induced fractures were distinguishable from the plane polarized micrograph. The bone fragment
is black in the central section but is white in the endosteum and
periosteum regions, thus the use of both colour and examination of
bone microstructure was successful in accordance with Shipman
et al. (1984) ﬁve stages of burning. Based on macroscopic and
microscopic examination, a temperature range of 600e900  C can
be assigned to this radius fragment.
The sample selected from burial EL75PM(b) (FN 273(b)) was
taken from an intensely cremated humerus fragment (Fig. 9). Under
plane polarized light the central section of this bone displayed
many osteons and some degree of structure, though many
hydroxyapatite crystals have fused causing a disorganised
arrangement (Fig. 10). At either side of this section, two dark areas
suggested decreased mineral content. This was particularly evident
in the periosteal region which could be clearly seen on the cross
polarized light micrograph (Fig. 11). The endosteal region of bone
shows a small number of Haversian systems in an even more disorganised arrangement when compared to the central section of
bone, suggesting exposure to higher temperatures and the fusion of
hydroxyapatite crystals. Over 50% of the bone microstructure has
been destroyed in this fragment. No heat-induced fractures were
apparent from this thin-section. The thin-section examined ranges
in colour from black to white and corresponds to the bone microstructure accordingly. However, the black central section of bone,
towards the endosteum, displays no microstructure and consequently disagrees with Shipman et al. (1984) ﬁve stages of burning.
Therefore, based on macroscopic and microscopic examination,
a temperature range of 600e900  C can be assigned to this
specimen.

An intensely cremated femur fragment was selected from burial
EL76NN (FN 549) (Fig. 12). This was a different fragment from the
sample used for FTIR analysis. The majority of the bone structure
from this section had been destroyed however two main areas
within the bone still possessed some osteons and structure (Fig. 13).
This was exempliﬁed on the cross polarized micrograph in which
some mineral content had survived in the central portion of the
bone (Fig. 14). Over 50% of the bone microstructure has been
destroyed. Some small heat-induced fractures were apparent in the
periosteal and endosteal regions of the bone section. The thinsection examined ranges in colour from white to black and corresponds to the bone microstructure accordingly. Therefore, based on
macroscopic and microscopic examination, a temperature range of
600e900  C can be assigned to this ulna fragment.
3.2. FTIR analysis
Table 4 presents results of the FTIR analyses. As can be seen,
there is a general trend with increased cremation intensity of
increasing CI and a drop in C/P. This is in keeping with previously
published work (such as Thompson et al., 2009, 2010). Despite the
relatively large standard deviations present (a likely feature of
sample size) it is possible to distinguish archaeological unburned
bone from archaeological burned bone. Further, with the combination of CI and C/P, (Fig. 15) it is possible to note more subtle
differences and distinguish unburned bone from bone burned at
low, medium and high intensities.
It can be seen that the two inhumed samples are separated from
the burned samples. Although there is not a great difference
between the CI values for these two inhumed samples and one of
the less intensively burned samples, there is a clear difference in C/
P values. Indeed C/P values are of greatest use again when differentiating the completely burned samples from the other burned
samples. Since there is some debate as to whether CI can be used to
accurately predict temperature of burning (Thompson et al., 2009)
it has not been used here in this way, however the conclusions of
the histological work and the crystallinity ratios are largely in
agreement. Furthermore, despite the criticisms already highlighted, colour can be useful as a broad indicator of burning
intensity and it can be seen in Table 4 that temperature correlates
well with colour which in turn relates well to CI and C/P values. The
application of CI and C/P to actual archaeological material is rare,
and it is therefore useful to note that the results from these
methods correlate well with more established techniques, and
therefore contribute a reliable and complementary analysis.
The presence of pyre goods from the Elsham sample was slightly
higher among remains that were completely cremated but were
not statistically signiﬁcant, which may be a result of small sample
size (Fig. 16). 71% of completely cremated burials contained artefacts while 56% of intensely cremated burials contained pyre goods.
Of course, some objects may not have been collected and deposited
in an urn after the cremation process and are therefore absent from
the archaeological record. Based on the lack of evidence, with

K.E. Squires et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 38 (2011) 2399e2409

cremation.

regards to the survival of pyre goods, it is difﬁcult to say if individuals who were cremated for longer periods of time were
interred with a greater number of pyre goods.
Interestingly, all of the completely cremated bones belonged to
the lower limb, with the exception of one humerus sample
(Table 5). The differential cremation between upper and lower
limbs was statistically signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level (X2 ¼ 4.06;
p ¼ 0.041). This creates signiﬁcant sampling considerations for
techniques such as FTIR analysis as it suggests, similar to histological sections, that different results will be achieved from
different areas of the body. This is potentially more signiﬁcant with
the use of CI than histological section, as the numerical differences
between, for example, burned and unburned archaeological bone,
can be slight. The results gained from analysis of the Elsham
remains demonstrate that areas with more fat, such as the thighs,
were cremated more successfully. This could either be a result of
their position on the pyre or the amount of fat stored in these
appendages. This is supported by the presence of numerous
complete hand phalanges that were recovered relatively unburned
from the Elsham burials. The inﬂuence of differential burning on
skeletal analyses will likely be reduced by the application of a range
of techniques on the material in combination with consistent
sampling across bodies and studies.

4. Discussion
The combined use of histomorphometry and FTIR analysis
generally corresponds well with macroscopic examination, though
anomalies do occur and demand further explanation. The techniques employed in this paper have demonstrated that the
temperatures reached on the funerary pyres at Elsham ranged from
600  C to over 900  C. Based on numerous examples acquired from
the Elsham samples it appears that high temperatures were achieved, which is exhibited on the periosteum and outer cortical region
of long bones. However, these bones were not completely cremated,

suggesting they were burnt for a shorter period of time. This indicates that the duration and oxidising conditions of cremation varied
signiﬁcantly. (Holden et al. (1995), 27) illustrated a relationship
between the temperature attained in the bone and the distance from
the periosteum. Longer periods of time would have allowed
complete cremation as the temperature would have been at a relatively constant heat. In contrast, shorter periods of time would have
affected the periosteum and outer cortical bone severely but the
endosteum and inner cortical bone would not have been completely
cremated. It is difﬁcult to say how long the cremation process would
have lasted. Duration and oxidation would have depended on many
factors such as weather conditions, fuel type, size of the pyre and
physique of the deceased. This is exempliﬁed by ethnographic
evidence for a pyre in Bali which took two and a half hours with the
use of gas jets but would normally have taken all day without the use
of such devices (Downes, 1999, 23).
Based on the results from the Elsham sample examined in this
study, it is suggested that some individuals were cremated for longer
periods of time than others. This has led to a number of inferences
regarding social status. Rather than basing archaeological understanding on grave goods alone, the techniques used in this article
propose an alternative avenue, and this is the investigation of the
time and economic investment that was spent on the cremation
process. A large funerary pyre may have paralleled contemporary
richly furnished inhumation burials with regards to visual experience which evoked memories of the deceased. The greater losses
within a community may have resulted in an elevated ability, and
perhaps a greater need, to expend resources in a more impressive
funerary display. It is possible that the cremation rite of a more
prominent member within society took a longer period of time, as
the community may have invested larger amounts of fuel, more time
in the construction of the pyre and subsequent collection of
cremated material. Literary references that support these points
come from (Tacitus (1999) 50e51) and Beowulf (Porter, 2006, 185)
which both discuss the collection of certain types of wood for
famous men. While in Homer’s Iliad (Homer (2003), 442) it was
noted that Hector, the deceased, was cremated and his brother and
comrades collected his white bones. There is a possibility that when
the bones turned white it may have been a sign that this was the
stage when a body was ‘completely’ cremated. However, the white
colour may only have been revealed on the periosteal region while
the internal cortical structure was not destroyed as a result of lower
temperatures, deoxidising conditions and a shorter period of time
exposed to high temperatures.
Interestingly, all of the completely cremated bones belonged to
the lower limb, with the exception of one humerus sample. The
differential cremation between upper and lower limbs was proved
to be statistically signiﬁcant. It appears that arm positions were
furthest away from the centre of the pyre. For instance, they may
have been placed on the cadaver’s torso region, and were perhaps
also poorly cremated due to the lack of fat on these extremities.
However, there are less soft tissues around the radius and ulna so
they would be expected to cremate more successfully than the
femur, which is surrounded by a greater amount of muscle. At the
early Anglo-Saxon inhumation cemetery at Berinsﬁeld in Oxfordshire the female with the highest number of grave goods was
buried in a supine position with her arms folded across her
stomach. Similarly, the child interred with the greatest number
grave goods was laid in a supine position with their arms tightly
ﬂexed across her chest (Boyle et al., 1995, 117). This may suggest
that individuals of a certain social standing were placed on the pyre,
or indeed inhumed, in a speciﬁc position. However, further
research is needed to prove this theory. The results gained from
analysis of the Elsham remains demonstrate that areas with more
soft tissues, such as the thighs, were cremated more successfully

2408

which may have been due to their location on the pyre or the
amount of fat in these locations. This is supported by the presence
of numerous complete hand phalanges that were recovered relatively unburned from the Elsham burials.
5. Conclusion
Macroscopic examination is useful to gain a general idea of
temperature, though more advanced techniques, in the form of
thin-section and FTIR analysis are required to gain a more precise
temperature range. The combined use of these methods can
contribute to our understanding of cremation temperature and
duration for osteological material from a variety of contexts. The
anomalies that were noted in this study highlighted that duration
was variable in the cremation process. However, further work is
required to gain a more accurate understanding of the actual
cremation duration during the early Anglo-Saxon period. This study
also revealed that the temperature of these pyres ranged from
600  C to over 900  C. Although pyre debris, such as glass and
copper alloy globules and slag, were noted when assessing the
cremated bone further work is required to determine the higher
temperatures reached by these cremation pyres which exceeded
900  C. Experimental work would be a good starting point by
heating human bone to temperatures of over 900  C and subsequently examining it using the methods employed in this paper. It
would also be useful to examine a number of different bones from
the same individual to gain a greater understanding of the
temperatures attained throughout the whole cadaver and their
position on the funerary pyre. Further work in this area, by
combining histomorphometry, FTIR analysis and macroscopic
examination, will not only contribute to our knowledge of pyre
technology and funerary ritual among past communities who
practised the cremation rite but will also assist in our understanding of modern cremated material from unknown contexts.
