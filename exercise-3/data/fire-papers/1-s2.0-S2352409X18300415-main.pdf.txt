Some problems with modelling the positions of prehistoric hunter-gatherer
settlements on the basis of landscape topography

T

A B S T R A C T

This paper discusses a couple of basic methodological problems inherent in predictive modelling as used today in
mapping the location of Stone Age settlements based solely on landscape topography/bathymetry. It argues that
the modelling approach employed is based on elements adopted from a type of landscape ecology that was
abandoned more than 20 years ago, because it was unable to produce reasonable results, and that it can be
diﬃcult to develop prediction methodology based on the present understanding of landscape ecology as being
extremely complex and dynamic. Furthermore, it maintains that the modelling approach currently employed in
Stone Age archaeology is based on assumptions about prehistoric resource-strategic behaviour that are simplistic
and out of tune with what we now know. It therefore questions whether it is possible to develop a precise and
eﬃcient predictive procedure for modelling the locations of Stone Age sites.

1. Introduction
Tthe use of topographical/bathymetric predictive modelling for
mapping prehistoric, i.e. Stone Age, hunter-gatherer settlements on
land and under water is seeing increasing application in both Cultural
Heritage management and research (Benjamin, 2010; Chang-Martínez
et al., 2015; Fischer, 2004; Fitch et al., 2007; Kamermans et al., 2009).
This is being undertaken in ways that prompt concern, because they
often focus exclusively on the topography/bathymetry of the prehistoric landscape surface, while ignoring the importance of the spatial
conﬁguration of the prehistoric vegetation. In landscape ecology, it is a
well-established fact that the vegetation on land, as well as in marine
areas, tends to form dynamic mosaics that inﬂuence small-scale animal
and human behaviour and thereby lead to signiﬁcant variation in the
cultural spatial behaviour over time (Bjørnstad et al., 1999; Bode &
Possingham, 2005; Grøn, 2012; Odum & Barrett, 2005, 246–255;
Turner & Gardner, 2015; Vandermeer, 2006; Levin et al., 1993, 50–60,
70–89, 277–304; Mustamäki et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2013; Warden
et al., 2017) (Fig. 1). A further problem is that this type of modelling is
often based on simplistic and general assumptions about how huntergatherers place their settlements in the landscape. These ignore both
archaeological and ethnoarchaeological evidence, which reveals signiﬁcant deviations from some of these assumptions and demonstrates
that diﬀerent hunter-gatherer cultures can behave diﬀerently in similar
landscapes, and that even individual groups can display signiﬁcant
behavioural diﬀerences (Vandermeer, 2006; Gross et al., 2018).

settlement distribution in the landscape renders the discipline more
complicated, both theoretically and practically. On the other hand, it
introduces a realistic relationship to the real world. One can only guess
why archaeology has been allowed to pick the simple and easy-tohandle modelling principles, while ignoring the more diﬃcult ones, in
its attempts to develop fast and cheap ‘desktop’ approaches to the
mapping of Stone Age settlements. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how poorly the hitherto applied type of modelling ﬁts with the
variations evident in hunter-gatherer settlement behaviour, thereby
underpinning the importance of developing new methodologies for either better predictive modelling or, alternatively, direct physical detection of Stone Age settlements.
2. The landscape concept in hunter-gatherer archaeology
In archaeological circles, the characteristics of the landscapes lived
in and used by prehistoric hunter-gatherers are generally conceived as
congruent with a landscape concept that was abandoned by landscape
ecology in the mid-1990s (Hansson et al., 1995):
A marked change has occurred recently within the science of ecology.
Previously, ecological processes commonly were assumed to proceed
within homogeneous environments, and usually within populations of
randomly distributed individuals. Recently it has been widely recognized
that environments are not homogeneous, and organisms are usually
clumped into patchy populations, and that this heterogeneity has signiﬁcant eﬀects on ecological processes.
This means that landscapes should basically be understood as

heterogeneous mosaics composed of patchworks of concentrations of
various plant (grasses, herbs, shrubs and trees) and animal (insects,
reptiles, amphibians, ﬁshes, birds, mammal etc.) communities (Odum &
Barrett, 2005, 375–411; Turner & Gardner, 2015, 175–228; Warden
et al., 2017).
While archaeological landscape modelling is based on the concept
of rather stable landscapes, landscape ecology operates with highly
dynamic landscapes, in which the diﬀerent parts of the mosaics asynchronously progress through the diﬀerent phases of individual ‘ecological successions’, from burnt patches to climax vegetation, if they
manage this before being burnt down once again. While the horizontal
diﬀerentiation of species in the landscape into mosaics may be due to
variations in geochemistry, moisture, air movements, shade/sun exposure, epidemics, storm damage etc., important drivers for terrestrial
and marine dynamics are regularly occurring wildﬁres and redeposition
of sea-ﬂoor sediments by currents and storms (Odum & Barrett, 2005,
194–199; Belsky, 1995; Lundquist et al., 2013) (Fig. 1). There are different types of wildﬁres – ground ﬁres, surface ﬁres, sub-canopy ﬁres
and crown ﬁres. These can occur in diﬀerent combinations and at different intervals, as well as with diﬀerent types of spread patterns, depending on vegetation type, wind, moisture, slope etc., which have
diﬀerent eﬀects on the landscape (Turner & Gardner, 2015, 175–228;
Saito, 2001; Sommers et al., 2011: 29; Weber, 2001).
Wildﬁres alone, independent of other factors, will in the most cases
be able to generate a landscape complexity and dynamics that make it
impossible to reconstruct in suﬃcient detail the prehistoric vegetation
and the consequent faunal and human spatial patterns. Alone the task of
identifying and dating, in relation to archaeological features, the many
signiﬁcant vegetation changes caused by wildﬁres, which in some areas
can occur as often as every 30–40 years (Wiens, 1995; Brown & Smith,
2000) (Figs. 1, 2), would be an extremely diﬃcult task. Even though
some modelling approaches include vegetational data at a basic and
general level, they will tend to lack a signiﬁcant part of the picture
necessary for mapping the Stone Age sites (Chang-Martínez et al., 2015;
Jasiewicz & Sobkowiak-Tabaka, 2015).
A further consequence of recent developments in landscape ecology
is that approaches to studies of prehistoric resources, such as the archaeological site-catchment analysis, must be regarded as outdated.
This is based on assumptions of an even distribution of stable resources
in the prehistoric landscape, which belongs to an earlier generation of
landscape ecology. Subsequent attempts to update this approach by
integrating it into the application of GIS techniques does not solve the
basic problem of establishing a suﬃciently precise spatio-temporal
environmental framework (Hunt, 1992; Jarman et al., 1972).

sites. Experience demonstrates that it identiﬁes zones where Stone Age
sites appear on the basis of very basic topographical assumptions, while
no attempts have been made to demonstrate that other topographical
situations, which the approach ignores, did not similarly attract Stone
Age settlement (Fischer, 1993; Fischer, 2007).
Topographical positions where Stone Age sites appear to be concentrated on the surface may well reﬂect the fact that some types of
location actively promote exposure of observable Stone Age material,
whereas others, for instance in areas where sediments accumulate, do
not. Proper testing of the ‘null-hypothesis’, that Stone Age sites are
randomly distributed in the landscape, can therefore be problematic,
even in relatively uncomplicated topographical modelling approaches.
In the case of the ﬁshing-site model it is, however, possible to evaluate
its validity.
Analyses of the distribution of Late Mesolithic coastal settlements in
a couple of well-surveyed areas, where these sites can be recorded
today in relation to their contemporaneous shoreline, which matches or
is above present sea level, produce a picture that deviates signiﬁcantly
from the one postulated by the model. In the Karrebæksminde Fjord
system, some of the settlements are located in accordance with the
model, but the majority is not (Figs. 3, 4) (Johansson, 1999; Johansson,
2006). Analysis of the positions of Mesolithic and Neolithic shell middens, relative to the former coastline, in the well-surveyed Limfjord
area, northern Jutland, gives a similar result (Figs. 3, 5) (Jensen, 2001:
157). In both cases, a signiﬁcant number of sites are found along the
sides as well as near the head of inlets, i.e. positions that are not

3. Hunter-gatherer landscape behaviour – in archaeology
Apart from the diﬃculties associated with temporal-spatial reconstruction of the prehistoric environment in suﬃcient detail to
permit identiﬁcation of optimal settlement locations, another serious
problem is that our perception of what the prehistoric hunting-gatherer
cultures regarded as good/optimal settlement locations often diﬀers, in
some cases signiﬁcantly, from the types of locations in which they actually placed their settlements.
One example is the so-called Danish ﬁshing-site model, which postulates that sites exploiting marine resources will be placed on the coast
in immediate proximity to topographical positions where these resources appear/pass by in larger concentrations (Fig. 3). This model is
interesting because, since it was introduced by the Danish Agency for
Culture, it has been accepted worldwide as an eﬀective method for
mapping submerged Stone Age sites, which would be diﬃcult and expensive to locate in other ways (Benjamin, 2010; Fischer, 2004). It is
also rather uncomplicated and typically representative for the types of
modelling that focus solely on topography and ignore other landscape
ecological factors. Strikingly, however, its validity has never been demonstrated through systematic analysis of a representative sample of

transported quite a distance to the sites (van Andel & Lianos, 1984;
Arias et al., 2009; Colonese et al., 2011; Gutiérrez-Zugasti et al., 2011;
Haws et al., 2011; Habu et al., 2011; Orquera et al., 2011; Rabett et al.,
2001; Saunders & Russo, 2011; Szabo & Amesbury, 2011; Wagner et al.,
2011; Degerbøl, 1943; Noe-Nygaard, 1971). One implicit, and possibly
erroneous, assumption underlying the ﬁshing-site model is the idea that
when groups utilised marine resources, these played a major role in
their subsistence economy. Even though the remains of molluscs can be
highly conspicuous in archaeological contexts, especially when piled up
into shell middens, marine resources may, in some cases, represent only
a minor supplement to the main economic base, and the settlements
may have been located optimally in relation to the most important
terrestrial resources (Colonese et al., 2011; Gutiérrez-Zugasti et al.,
2011; Orquera et al., 2011; Saunders & Russo, 2011). Taking account in
predictive modelling of the considerable variation in the weighting of
various resource types would, however, lead to a very complex procedure without solving the problem of high-resolution vegetation dynamics.
A well-documented archaeological example of how diﬀerent cultures employ diﬀerent resource strategies and, accordingly, have

predicted by the model.
Analysis of available Danish maritime archaeological survey reports
up to 2015 shows that systematic survey of a total of 316.9 km2, based
on the ﬁshing-site model, has led to the recording of 15 ‘new’ Stone Age
sites (=0.05 per km2). Random recording on land of a total of
2192.7 km2 in several selected Danish counties has led to the recording
of 3258 Stone Age sites (=1.48 per km2). Systematic surface survey on
land of a total of 33.8 km2 in two areas on Zealand, Denmark, has led to
the recording of 291 Stone Age sites (=8.61 per km2). Therefore, the
density of submerged Stone Age sites recorded during systematic survey
in accordance with the ﬁshing-site model represents 0.6% of the density
of Stone Age sites recorded on land during systematic surface survey
(Grøn, 2015).
Even though it can be debated whether the 0.6% should be adjusted
slightly upwards, the results outlined above indicate indisputably that
something must be wrong with the basic ‘topographical’ assumptions
behind the ﬁshing-site model. Results from many parts of the world
show that Mesolithic and Upper Palaeolithic settlements exploiting
marine resources can be located several kilometres inland from contemporaneous coastlines, such that marine resources had to be

As far back as the 1970s, pollen analysts suggested, with only limited archaeological response, that some of the wildﬁres they were able
to trace in the peat cores they studied appeared to be anthropogenic in
origin. They were though unable to provide conclusive evidence for this
interpretation due to restrictions imposed by the temporal resolution
they were able to attain. Recently, more convincing evidence has appeared in support of this point of view (Innes et al., 2004; Selsing, 2016;
Simmons, 1975; Simmons, 1996).

diﬀerent settlement patterns, is provided by the appearance of the
Thule culture in Alaska around 900 CE. This culture based its subsistence on much broader exploitation of the available maritime resources, and the employment of a wider range of hunting techniques,
than the earlier Birknirk/Norton cultures in the area. The Thule culture
appears to represent a strategic shift from hunting of larger pods of
whales, which was only possible in a few coastal locations, to the targeting of single individuals, such as bowhead whales, by smaller highly
mobile crews in the open sea. Blubber lamps were introduced as a
heating source, supplementing wood-ﬁred hearths. This new resource
strategy is consistent with a shift from relatively few larger villages to a
greater number of smaller settlements. The Thule culture's rapid spread
as a replacement for the Dorset culture in large parts of Canada around
1000 CE, and to Greenland in 1200 CE, most likely reﬂects the fact that
it was highly successful (Gulløv, 2004: 178–179, 283–343; McGhee,
1984). This example is interesting because it involves the development
of a new and apparently superior strategy for resource exploitation,
accompanied by a new and signiﬁcantly diﬀerent settlement pattern
within a restricted time interval. It concurs with Murray's central conclusion about the economies of the Palaeoeskimo cultures of the Foxe
Basin, Canada (Murray, 1996):

4. Hunter-gatherer landscape behaviour – in ethnoarchaeology
and social anthropology
While the archaeological data can demonstrate clear deviations
from simpliﬁed model patterns, observations from ethnoarchaeology
and social anthropology can provide a better understanding of the
cultural-ideological diﬀerences behind such pattern variations. One
example of how ideological diﬀerences result in variations in settlement
patterns in quite similar environments is evident from two huntergatherer cultures: the Evenk (Siberia) and the Mistissini Iinuu (formerly
the Mistassini Cree) (Canada). The Evenk drink melted snow in winter
and maintain that they prefer its taste to that of unfrozen water from
rivers and lakes, which must be obtained through an often quite thick
layer of ice. In contrast, the Mistissini Iinuu are forbidden to drink
melted snow and ice and must therefore obtain unfrozen water through
holes in the ice all winter. As a consequence, the Mistassini winter
camps are always located immediately adjacent to lakes or rivers, while
the Evenk winter sites and winter hunting cabins can be up to 5 km
from the nearest water body (Grøn, 2012; Tanner personal communication).
The Evenk also identify cold valleys with little wind, where the cold
air accumulates on their ﬂoors, and they place their winter settlements
relatively high up the mountain sides and in warmer valleys, where
downdraughts level out the temperature diﬀerences so that the dwellings can be placed somewhat lower. The crucial factor is, however, that
their winter settlements are placed close to areas with the snow conditions preferred by reindeer, their main winter game in some regions
(Grøn, 2012). It will obviously be extremely diﬃcult to reconstruct such
environmental details, and their potential variation, even though they
are of major importance to the Evenk.
A speciﬁc trait of some Eurasian hunter-gatherer groups is the use of

[…] it is clear that there was a wide range of economic options for Arctic
peoples, despite a perception that this might not have been the case. While
it is true that the number of diﬀerent animal resources in the Arctic may
have been limited, the ways in which humans chose to exploit available
resources were highly variable. Economies varied temporally, geographically and culturally.
In addition to small-scale landscape dynamics and cultural economic diversity, the possibility of modelling optimal settlement zones
for prehistoric hunter-gatherers is complicated by strategic human
manipulation of the environment. While observation of such strategies
is easier in ethnoarchaeological studies of living cultures, there is
convincing archaeological evidence of both controlled burning at the
Mesolithic site of Star Carr in England, reﬂected in charred plant macroremains found at the site, and the extensive systematic coppicing or
controlled burning of hazel thickets to produce straight-grown hazel
rods for wattle panels used in Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic ﬁshing
weirs on Zealand in Denmark (Grøn, 2012; Hather, 1998; Christensen,
1997).

domesticated reindeer for transport. The ‘contract’ between humans
and their transport reindeer is that the former supply the latter with:
good grazing near the settlements (in addition to their winter food, lichen, reindeer also eat more than 30 diﬀerent grass and shrub species),
salt (often in the form of frozen human urine in winter), smoke in the
summer as protection against mosquitoes (from smudge ﬁres of fresh
larch twigs) (Grøn et al., 1999) (Fig. 6) and, where possible, easy access
to naled areas (i.e. lakes and rivers frozen until around august) near the
settlements so that the reindeer can, when the mosquito problem becomes too unpleasant, take refuge on the ice were the cold air immediately kills the insects. In principle, the domesticated reindeer, including the transport reindeer, are free to run away if they wish, but
they stay with their humans out of habit and because this behaviour
provides them with the above advantages. Consequently, the settlement
locations for hunter-gatherers with transport reindeer will be chosen
with their reindeers' demands in mind, which means that they will tend
to diﬀer from settlement locations chosen by hunter-gatherers without
domesticated reindeer. (1)
Reindeer domestication is generally believed to extend back to the
1st millennium BC (Ingold, 1980: 104–107; Aronsson, 1991). In good
accordance with this, petroglyphs in the Sayan Mountains in Siberia
showing humans riding reindeer are dated back to the Bronze Age
(Devlet, 1965; Vainshtein, 1980: 120–121, 134). However, petroglyphs
showing a human riding a reindeer, a human apparently handling a
reindeer as a transport animal and several corrals of the type reindeer
cultures use to protect their animals and to catch them in for butchering
of selected individuals in the autumn evident at the rock art site in Alta,
Norway, have fairly reliable coastline dates of c. 4500 BCE (Helskog,
1988: 31–34, 40–41, 75, 83, 104–105; Helskog, 1999; Helskog, 2011).
Since even earlier reindeer domestication has been discussed, this
problem might also be relevant to earlier Stone Age sites (Bahn, 1984;
Grøn, 2011; Higgs & Jarman, 1969; White, 1989).
Based on new ethnoarchaeological data, concepts of hunter-gatherer societies are currently undergoing radical change. Whereas these
cultural groups were previously seen as exploiting plants and animals in
a rather ‘passive’ way, without any conscious management, their active
strategic manipulation of ﬂoral and faunal resources has recently become central to the understanding of the subsistence economy extending back 50,000–100,000 years, or possibly even further (Grøn,
2012; Lewis, 1973; Anderson, 2005; Lightfoot & Parrish, 2009; Morgan

et al., 2017; Pyne, 2001; Archibald et al., 2012; Bird et al., 2016; Boivin
et al., 2016).
Where the evidence of manipulation strategies applied to vegetational resources, and the positive impact of some of these on game
populations is well-founded, direct manipulation of game resources still
requires further documentation,
One tangible example of the direct hunter-gatherer manipulation of
animal populations is the systematic shooting of predators in larger
river valleys in Siberia to create a local overpopulation of moose/
European elk, thereby forcing younger individuals into parts of the
landscape where they would not normally be found, but where the
Evenk wanted a game population for winter hunting (Grøn, 2012; Grøn
& Turov, 2007).

5. Discussion
It is obvious from the above that several serious drawbacks associated with the widely used ﬁshing-site model are of such a general
character that they are also problematic relative to other topographically/bathymetrically-based predictive modelling approaches to
identifying the locations Stone Age hunter settlements in the landscape.
The basic assumption that both ﬂoral and faunal elements had a rather
even distribution in the prehistoric landscape is in direct conﬂict with
the views of landscape ecology today. There is a need to update archaeological predictive modelling to a level where it can cope with the
evident complexity of the situation, in addition to improving the topographical/bathymetric data which play such a dominant role in
current modelling approaches – if this is possible.
During my ﬁeldwork in Siberia, it was interesting to observe the
frequent wildﬁres in the landscape we travelled through, and observe
the signiﬁcant eﬀects they have on the vegetation. The smaller wildﬁres
are not regarded as a problem by the Evenk. But the larger ones, which
appear more recently to be a consequence of increased dryness, potentially related to global warming, create enormous severely burnt and
unusable zones. The Evenk cannot move here with their reindeer because the almost 40–50 cm thick layer of lichen and other suitable
reindeer fodder has been burnt away. Dynamic situations such as this
can be diﬃcult to understand and accept if one is used to living in
agriculturally managed landscapes, but for the Evenk and many other
similar groups living in ‘wild’ landscapes is a matter of routine.

Another basic assumption is that all hunter-gatherer groups act in
similar ways in relation to similar landscape situations. This view also
needs fundamental revision, as both the archaeological record and the
available ethnoarchaeological data demonstrate that diﬀerent cultural
groups can adopt very diﬀerent economic strategies in similar landscapes.
In practical survey work, a major additional problem is consequently that the economic strategic behaviour of each of the local
groups being surveyed must be known in advance. This is likely to be
both extremely expensive and time consuming. Consideration of the
potential for further complications from conscious resource manipulation makes it clear that the type of predictive modelling discussed
above may be very diﬃcult to apply to archaeological survey in the way
we would like.
The conclusion from the above is that archaeological modelling
relying on earlier landscape ecological concepts and older ideas about
the economic-strategic behaviour of small-scale prehistoric huntinggathering cultures, which facilitated relatively easy modelling of optimal settlement locations, requires signiﬁcant updating. Models of the
resources accessible from the chosen settlements, such as the sitecatchment analysis, suﬀer from the same basic problems and will require similar revision. Dabbling with agent-based modelling may not
solve the basic problem, which is related to the applied system's ability
to deal with vegetation dynamics. These can be potentially impossible
to reconstruct in the necessary detail and are, moreover, related to
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in cultural behaviour patterns. A central problem
is consequently having to decide which patterns should be expected
when and where.
It is possible that the continued use in archaeology of predictive
modelling based on topographic/bathymetric factors is exclusively due
to recognition of the fact that any attempt to develop more realistic
modelling might lead to a troublesome future for this discipline and its
related smart and cheap GIS-based desktop solutions that are so popular
with some heritage managers. From a user point of view, however, it
will be of immense importance to clarify whether predictive modelling
has a future in archaeology – albeit in a probably somewhat costlier
version. If not, it is time to focus on, and invest in, the development of
viable alternatives.
One promising method under development in this respect is acoustic
detection of lithics knapped by humans. It appears that human knapping confers special acoustic properties on the removed debitage that
are not developed with natural cleavage of the same materials. These
artefacts can therefore be detected by acoustic means even though they
are embedded in sea-ﬂoor sediments. The method requires further development (which is ongoing) before it can be applied in maritime archaeological survey as an eﬀective alternative to diver inspection and
modelling. This direct detection approach will not, however, be able to
detect Stone Age sites with no knapped lithics (Hermand et al., 2011;
Hermand & Tayong, 2013; Grøn et al., 2018).
