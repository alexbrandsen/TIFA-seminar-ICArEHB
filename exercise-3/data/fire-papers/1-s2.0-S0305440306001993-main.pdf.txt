Abstract
The thermoluminescence dating method was applied to 77 heated flints from the Mousterian layers of Hayonim Cave in order to provide
a precise TL-based chronology for this important Levantine sequence. A detailed dosimetric study was performed by using 76 dosimeter capsules and revealed strong spatial dose-rate variations. In parallel, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry enabled the identification of various
mineral assemblages in the sediments of the cave and to localize the boundaries of these assemblages. By comparing these two data sets, it is
shown that low dose-rate values (w500 mGy/a) are systematically recorded in areas where the calcite-dahllite (CD) assemblage is preserved,
whereas higher values (up to 1300 mGy/a) are associated with the leucophosphite, montgomeryite, variscite and siliceous aggregates (LMVS)
assemblage. The dosimetric and mineralogical information was combined in order to assess, where possible, the dose-rate experienced by
each flint during its burial. Some of the flint samples analyzed were too close to mineral assemblage boundaries and were therefore discarded.
This rigorous selection led to TL ages ranging from 230 to 140 ka for the lower part of the Mousterian sequence (layers F and Lower E), which
contains lithic industries characterized by blade production using the laminar method.

by karstic activities in an Upper Cretaceous limestone reef and
is characterized by a huge arch providing access to several
chambers, one of which is open to the outside by means of
a 25-m-high chimney. The sedimentary infilling is at least
6 m thick and is mainly of anthropic origin (Goldberg and
Bar-Yosef, 1998); the sediments contain remains of combustion products (charcoal, ash remnants and phytoliths .), lithic

materials and bone residues from both large (gazelles, fallow
deer, aurochs) and small (tortoises, lizards and rabbits) animals
(Stiner, 2006; Stiner et al., 2000). The sequence is divided
into several layers, from G (bottom) to A (top), containing
a succession of occupations representing Middle Palaeolithic,
Upper Palaeolithic and Natufian periods (Bar-Yosef, 1991;
Bar-Yosef et al., 2006).
The excavations carried out between 1992 and 1999 were
confined to two distinct locations within the site, the Central
Area and the Deep Sounding, and mainly focused on the Mousterian sequence. During these excavations, the otherwise homogeneous Mousterian deposits of Layer E could be subdivided on
the basis of lithic densities in order to evaluate chronological
changes in the history of human occupation of the cave.
In Layer F and in the lower part of Layer E (units 6e4), the
association of Levallois debitage with true blade technology
(Laminar debitage) provides a specific aspect to this industry
(Meignen, 1998, 2000). Characterized by the presence of elongated products (blades and points, often retouched) together
with short often triangular Levallois blanks, the lithic assemblages closely resemble the material found in Abou Sif
(Neuville, 1951). Generally speaking, they show global affinities in their core reduction strategies with the assemblages
classically labelled as ‘‘Tabun D type’’ or Early Levantine
Mousterian found in several sites throughout the Near East,
even if the tool-kits show some variations. In contrast, in the
Upper E assemblages (units 1e3), Levallois technology is
clearly oriented towards the production of short and thin flakes
(Meignen, 1998). Core management is evidenced by the

1065

presence of centripetal and unidirectionnal removals resulting
in oval, quadrangular and subtriangular blanks. Retouched
tools include mainly side-scrapers on large Levallois blanks.
By all these criteria, the Upper E assemblages (especially units
1 and 2, with centripetal core preparation) show some affinities
with the so-called ‘‘Tabun C type’’ industries found, for example, in Tabun unit I (Jelinek, 1981), in most layers from Qafzeh
(Hovers, 1997) and Ksar Akil XXVI (Marks and Volkman,
1986). In fact, the preliminary technological study of these
Upper E assemblages once more illustrates the variability
and flexibility of the Levallois technology, resulting in an array
of products of controlled morphology (Meignen, 1998).
Zooarchaeological analyses of the ungulate remains in
Mousterian Layer E indicate that large animals were obtained
by hunting, and prey biomass comparisons demonstrate that
large game were the principal sources of meat, supplemented
by modest quantities of tortoises and other slow-moving small
animals (Stiner, 2006). The results also indicate significant
expansion in human dietary breadth immediately following
the Mousterian, and predator pressure on tortoise populations
implies subtle increases in human population densities around
the time of the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition (Stiner
et al., 2000). Human populations of the early Middle Paleolithic
appear to have been small and widely dispersed, accounting for
the relatively ephemeral nature of the Mousterian occupations at
Hayonim Cave in contrast to those documented for the late Middle Paleolithic at Kebara Cave (Bar-Yosef, 1998; Stiner, 2006).
The few Middle Paleolithic hominid remains recovered at
Hayonim Cave were concentrated in the central area of the
cave (except for one specimen discovered in the entrance
area) and the majority of them originated from upper stratigraphic units of layer E. To date, the fossil hominid record
from other Mediterranean Levantine sites (i.e. Amud, Geula,
Kebara, Qafzeh, Skhul, and Tabun) provides evidence that
Mousterian assemblages can be associated with distinct human
groups. In the past decade, there have been contradictory opinions expressed on the interpretation of anatomical differences
between these fossil hominids and especially on the taxonomic
designation of the Amud, Kebara and Tabun individuals (e.g.
Arensburg, 2002; Arensburg and Belfer-Cohen, 1998; Hovers
et al., 1995; Mann, 1995; Rak, 1998; Tillier, 1998; Tillier
et al., 2003; Trinkaus, 1995; Vandermeersch, 1995). A major
difference between the fossil record from the above-mentioned
sites and that from Hayonim site lies in the fact that the latter
has a low density of hominid remains and is dominated by isolated specimens (fragmentary skull remains, isolated teeth, cervical vertebra, hand and foot bones, parts of long bones) that
are not suitable for precise taxonomic assignment (Arensburg
et al., 1980; Arensburg et al., 1990). Moreover, in contrast
with other Levantine sites, Hayonim Cave provides no evidence for mortuary practices within the Mousterian sequence.
2. Chronometric dating at Hayonim Cave
The chronology of the Hayonim Mousterian sequence
has attracted much attention during the last two decades.
Comparisons of micro-faunal remains with other Levantine

N. Mercier et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 34 (2007) 1064e1077

archaeological sequences (Tchernov, 1988; Tchernov, 1998)
indicated that the faunal assemblages from Upper E in Hayonim Cave predated those discovered in Qafzeh Cave. Absolute dating methods have also been applied extensively: the
U-series method was applied to a speleothem unearthed
from the Mousterian deposits and provided the first reliable
date (Schwarcz et al., 1980). Optical dating of sediments
was attempted (Godfrey-Smith, personal communication)
and preliminary results were obtained from the Thermoluminescence (TL) study of burnt lithics (Valladas et al., 1988).
In parallel, the Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) dating
method was applied to tooth enamel (Schwarcz and Rink,
1998). More recently, combined ESR/U-series analyses
yielded detailed radiometric information indicating that the
age of the Upper E Mousterian layer is around 180 ka, and
not younger than 155 ka (Rink et al., 2004).
In this paper, we report the results of a study initiated
10 years ago whose aim was to provide a TL-based chronology
for the Hayonim Mousterian sequence. A total of 77 age estimates obtained on heated flints is presented with associated
radiometric information. Particular attention is given to environmental dose-rate variations through space and time, and to
their possible correlations with the distribution of authigenic
minerals formed as a result of diagenetic processes (Weiner
et al., 2002). It is shown how these data can be combined in
order to discard some TL results and to increase the reliability
of the remaining TL ages.
3. Samples and methods
During the last 30 years, the TL method has been extensively
used for the dating of burned flints discovered in archaeological
sites, in particular those sites beyond the range of radiocarbon
(Huxtable and Aitken, 1988; Mercier et al., 1991, 1995a,b,c,
2000; Valladas et al., 1986, 1987, 1988, 1998). The utility of
the method is based on the fact that flints behave as excellent
natural dosimeters which record doses delivered by the different types of radiation coming from the decay of radioisotopes,
such as the U- and Th-series and potassium. The TL method is

3.1. Burnt flint specimens and dosimetric measurements
More than 100 flint artefacts showing signs of heating were
selected during the excavation campaigns at Hayonim Cave.
The sample preparation followed the protocol defined by
Valladas (1992). After the outermost 2 mm of each flint
were removed, the remaining core was crushed and subjected
to chemical treatment and its TL emission was analyzed. Only
77 flints had been heated at temperatures sufficient to ensure
a complete resetting of the TL signal, and only these were selected for further analyses. Fig. 2 shows the TL emissions of
sample (HAY 7) as well as the equivalent dose (ED). The natural and regenerated growth curves are typical of the sublinear behavior observed for most of the Hayonim samples.
These samples come from the Deep Sounding (squares D-EF-28-27-26), and from the southern (squares I-J-K-24-23-22)
and northern parts (squares G-H-I-J-20-19-18) of the Central
Area of the excavations (Fig. 3).
As the excavations covered a relatively large area
(w23 m2), great effort was made to obtain detailed information
on spatial variations in environmental dosimetry. A total of 76
calcium sulfate dosimeters were placed in different sections of
the cave and remained in place for approximately 1 year. Most
of them were inserted horizontally in the newly exposed profiles close to squares containing numerous burnt flints: G18,
H19 and I20 e North section; K23-24 and I24 e South section
and, in the Deep Sounding: squares D-E-F27 and F28. A few
dosimeters were also inserted vertically at the end of the field
season in squares where excavation was scheduled in subsequent
years (see Fig. 3). Additional dosimetric countings were carried
out on-site using a portable g-detector inserted in natural holes

based on dosimetric measurements of these ionizing radiations.
Short-ranged a and b particles (w20 mm and w2 mm, respectively) emitted from radioisotopes within the flint itself, provide
an ‘‘internal dose’’. An ‘‘external dose’’ from long range
(w40 cm max.) g-rays (as well as from cosmic radiations)
necessitate consideration of the immediate environment of the
flints.

(burrows) present in some profiles, a few other measurements
were made in the laboratory with a high purity germanium
detector. In this case, about 100 g of sediment were analyzed
by g-spectrometry for obtaining information on possible disequilibria in the radioactive decay chains and investigating the
repartition of the g dose-rate between the U- and Th-series
and potassium.
3.2. Fourier Transform Infrared analyses of sediments
Mineralogical analyses were carried out on-site during the
excavation of Hayonim Cave using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in order to better understand
the archaeology via sediment diagenesis and site formation
processes (Weiner et al., 2002). This method is capable of
identifying mineral assemblages using only a few tens of micrograms of sample (Weiner et al., 1993). More than 2100
samples were analyzed. It was shown that three major mineral assemblages are present in the archaeological assemblages at Hayonim: the first, termed CD (Weiner et al.,
2002), is composed mainly of calcite and secondarily of
dahllite. Calcite is the main residue of the fresh ash which
originally made up the bulk of the sediments (Schiegl
et al., 1994). Dahllite (also known as carbonated hydroxyapatite) results from interaction of calcite with phosphate-rich
solutions. The second assemblage, termed LMVS, represents
sediments that are more diagenetically altered. In the course
of the diagenetic process, the dahllite dissolves and is replaced by other more stable phosphate minerals such as
leucophosphite, montgomeryite and variscite. Due to the
dissolution and transport of other minerals, the relative proportions of so-called siliceous aggregates and phytoliths, minor components in the original ash, increase with ongoing

diagenesis. Note that the siliceous aggregates themselves,
as well as one of the common authigenic phosphate minerals
(leucophosphite) contain potassium (Schiegl et al., 1996). As
noted above, the formation of the LMVS assemblage also results in the dissolution of bones which are composed of dahllite, a relatively unstable mineral with respect to the LMVS
group. The third identified mineral assemblage consists of
the most highly altered sediments, in which clays have broken down and silica has been released.
The extensive study of sediment mineralogy in the field
also provided a detailed map of the spatial distribution of
the three mineral assemblages. This map showed sharp variation in sediment mineralogy over distances as short as a few
centimeters (Weiner et al., 2002; see their Figs. 10 and 11,
for instance).
At this stage, it is interesting to notice that the local differences in sediment chemistry and rates of diagenetic activity,
based on a combination of taphonomic methods and Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analyses of sediment
and bones (Stiner et al., 2001; Weiner et al., 2002), correlate
closely with the distribution of bones in the sediments at Hayonim Cave. The quality of bone preservation follows an ‘‘allor-nothing’’ pattern in the central area, with relatively abrupt
changes in bone abundance rather than gradual transitions between good to poor preservation. The areas of good bone
preservation are extensive and associate consistently with
CD mineral assemblages dominated by calcite, dahllite or
both. Bone preservation in Layer E was best within 2e3 m
of the cave walls in the central area, especially between
420 and 500 cm below datum. Very few bones were preserved
anywhere in Layer F, where secondary mineral assemblages
(LMVS and altered clays) predominate in the sediments
(Weiner et al., 2002).

Environmental dose-rates (mGy/a) measured with calcium sulfate dosimeters as a function of depth Z, for squares: (a) H19-G18; (b) L22-23-24; (c) I25-H2324; (d) K-J25; (e) F27-28-29-E28-29 and (f) E26-D26-27-28. Note that for (a) and (b), the values are high (w1100 mGy/a) and low (w500 mGy/a), respectively, but
do not vary significantly with depth. In contrast, for (c) and (d), the recorded dose-rates vary significantly, even on a relatively small scale (10e20 cm). In the Deep
Sounding the values are around 1000e1200 mGy/a (e) or range from 500 to 800 mGy/a (f), but some are higher by w30%.

4. Dosimetry results
4.1. Present-day environmental dose-rates
In Fig. 4 the environmental dose-rates recorded by the dosimeters are plotted as a function of depth. For simplification,
they were grouped into nearby squares (a, H19-G18; b, L2223-24; c, I25-H23-24; d, K25-J25 for the Central Area; e,
F27-28-29-E28-29; and f, E26-D26-27-28 for the Deep
Sounding). In squares H19-G18, the values are homogeneous,
ranging from 900 to 1100 mGy/a (not including one value at

w1300 mGy/a) with 10% dispersion around the mean, and
do not vary significantly with depth from Z ¼ 250 to
Z ¼ 550 cm (Fig. 4a). The same trend with depth is observed
for squares L22-23-24 (Fig. 4b), although the values are much
lower (400e550 mGy/a). The range of variation in both profiles is about the same (w10%). On the other hand, the
dose-rates can vary even over small differences of elevation
in squares I25-H23-24 (Fig. 4c) and K25-J25 (Fig. 4d). In
the Deep Sounding, significant variation also exist in squares
E26-D26-27-28 (Fig. 4f) where dose-rates range from 500 to
1000 mGy/a. One can then conclude that in certain sections

N. Mercier et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 34 (2007) 1064e1077

of the cave, the environmental dose-rates do not vary significantly with depth over 1m or more, while in other parts, there
are substantial variations at even small scales (<10 cm), horizontally and/or vertically.
These observations have direct implications for dating when
dosimetric methods are used. We note that the range of the
most energetic g-rays (w40 cm) is greater than the small-scale
heterogeneity. Moreover present-day dose-rate measurements
are seldom recorded at the precise locations where flint samples were collected, but at distances up to 1 m or more. This
is not a problem in a homogeneous mineralogical environment
where the dose-rate calculated by averaging the doses recorded
in neighboring dosimeters should be representative of the doserate received by a sample in the same environment; in a heterogeneous mineralogical environment, however, the dose-rate
values measured at different locations may differ significantly
from the dose experienced by the sample. This fact clearly has
to be taken into account when determining the environmental
dose of a given sample.
4.2. Basis for the dosimetric heterogeneities
In the course of the field seasons, a general overview of the
distribution of mineral assemblages in the cave and dose-rate
values showed a strong correlation, as did the distributions of
mineral assemblages and bone abundance. In sections where
calcite and dahllite were abundant (CD assemblage), dose-rates
around 500 mGy/a were recorded, whereas in sections rich in
leucophosphite, montgomeryite, variscite and siliceous aggregates (LMVS assemblage), the dose-rates were significantly
higher (up to 1300 mGy/a). In order to understand the basis
for this correlation, sediment samples (w300 mg) were taken
from various sections, homogenized and the major minerals
identified by FTIR. In parallel, neutron activation analysis
(NAA) was performed on the remaining powder (w250 mg)
and the radioisotope contents (U, Th and K) were measured
(Mercier et al., 1995). Fig. 5 gives the g dose-rates calculated
by assuming that the identified minerals were the only components in the environment (within a radius of at least 50 cm, i.e.,
greater than the typical range of the g-rays). It is worth noting
that the results basically confirm at a very small scale (the
‘‘scale’’ of a 300 mg sample) what was observed at a large
scale: low dose-rates are associated with the CD assemblage
(calcite and dahllite), and high dose-rates are associated with
the assemblage made up of siliceous aggregates with varying
quantities of leucophosphite and montgomeryite. The on-site
survey with a gamma spectrometer also revealed that the lowest
dose-rates (w300 mGy/a) were measured from sediments dominated by calcite. Note too that Fig. 5 shows some exceptions,
the most glaring being that one sample dominated by dahllite
which has the third highest dose-rate. It should be noted that
carbonated apatite has a tendency to readily occlude a variety
of different ions, including apparently potassium.
These mineralogical data can also explain the variation in
dose-rate observed along different profiles (Fig. 4). In mineralogically homogeneous sections, dose-rate values are fairly homogeneous: either low (w500 mGy/a) as in squares L22-23-24

1069

or high (w1000 mGy/a) as in squares H19-G18. In areas where
sharp mineralogical boundaries exist, the measured dose-rates
have intermediate values depending on the relative distance
of the dosimeters from these boundaries (see Weiner et al.
(2002) for details on mineral assemblage distributions,
and Aitken (1985) for dose-rate variations as a function of
the relative distance). The implication of these observations
to TL dating is that it is difficult, if not impossible, to reliably
estimate a representative dose-rate for any burned flint samples
located within 30 cm of a boundary between mineral assemblages. These samples cannot therefore be used for establishing
a chronology.
4.3. Dose-rate changes with time
The NAA data can provide some insight into the basis of the
dose-rate changes. Fig. 6a shows the distribution of the dose
into the different components (the U- and Th-series and K40). There is no obvious correlation between major mineral
types and the source of radiation. As the samples are listed according to increasing radiation dose, one can however notice
that high dose-rates are correlated with samples dominated
by siliceous aggregates, which have high potassium contents
(Schiegl et al., 1994, 1996). This is clearly demonstrated in
Fig. 6b, which shows that the total g dose-rate increases linearly as a function of the potassium content of the samples. Consequently, the contribution of the U- and Th-series to the annual
dose-rate does not exceed 30e40%, except for a few samples.
As siliceous aggregates are only a minor component of
fresh ash, samples dominated by siliceous aggregates must
have undergone severe diagenesis resulting in the loss of the
other components. This raises the important question of
when this diagenesis occurred, as the timing could clearly affect the mean dose-rates experienced by the samples and consequently, the calculated ages. If, for example, the diagenesis

this would not affect the TL ages as the dose-rate measurements today would be representative of the dose-rates experienced by the flints over most of the time since deposition.
Karkanas et al. (2000) and Shahack-Gross et al. (2004)
have presented several lines of evidence all pointing to the
conclusion that diagenesis in prehistoric caves in the Levant
and in Greece, took place soon after burial, possibly even
within hundreds or tens of years. One reason is that the diagenesis is driven mainly by the breakdown of organic material
from bat and bird guano. This produces acids that in turn cause
the dissolution of less stable minerals and the formation of
more stable ones. So we assumed that the diagenetic history
of the mineralogical assemblages in Hayonim Cave is not
a major factor which induced changes in the dose-rates with
time and so we used the present-day dose-rates to calculate
the TL ages.

Fig. 6. (a) Contribution to dose-rate of the different components (the U- and
Th-series and K-40). Note that the samples are listed from top to bottom with
increasing total g dose-rate. As no significant disequilibria have been detected
in the 100 g sediment samples analyzed by g-spectrometry in the laboratory,
the listed g dose-rates were calculated by taking into account all the g-rays of
the U- and Th-series. The second most abundant constituents are shown in
brackets. S.A. refers to siliceous aggregates. (b) A plot of the total g dose-rate
as a function of the K content of the samples shows a linear correlation.

was a slow steady process that took place during most of the
period of time that elapsed after the flint was deposited in
the sediments, then using the present-day relatively high
dose-rate would result in TL ages that are too young. If, on
the other hand, the diagenesis took place soon after burial,

As noted previously, the primary difficulty in evaluating the
dose-rate for a given burned flint is related to its distance from
a boundary between two mineral assemblages. For a sample
unearthed from one of the two distinct environments (CD
and LMVS assemblages) at a distance greater than 30 cm
from an identified mineralogical boundary, the dose-rate was
calculated by averaging the individual dose-rates recorded
by the neighboring dosimeters in the same mineralogical environment. However, every sample located at a distance less
than 30 cm from a boundary, as defined using the FTIR
data, was noted and is identified with an asterisk (last column
of Table 1), since the present-day environmental dose-rate it
received just before it was unearthed cannot be determined
with any reliability. The marked samples were then excluded
from the discussion on the chronostratigraphy.
Table 1 lists 77 burnt flint samples from Hayonim Cave
with their laboratory numbers, the layers and units in which
they were discovered, their locations and relevant dosimetric
data, as well as the estimated TL ages and associated errors.
Details concerning the radiometric data and luminescence
measurements are given in the legend of Table 1. All these
TL ages are plotted in Fig. 7, as a function of stratigraphy.
In general, it appears that the rejected samples (marked by
an asterisk in Table 1 and open symbols in Fig. 7) have ages
which are often scattered and in disagreement (older or younger) with those obtained for samples located in homogeneous
dosimetric environments. Consequently, our methodology for
selecting samples appears reliable and gives us confidence in
the average ages listed below. However, this approach made
us exclude several samples whose ages were in the same range
as the others for the same layer.
5.2. Average ages
The selected samples (without an asterisk) were grouped
into three sets depending on their location and their identified

The U, Th and K contents of flints were measured by neutron activation analysis (NAA) at the Pierre Süe Laboratory, Saclay (Joron, 1974) and have each an error of 10%. The S-a sensitivity (Valladas and
Valladas, 1982) was determined by comparing TL signals induced respectively by a b dose (Sr-90 source: dose-rate 8.2 Gy/min) and by a-rays from a Pu-238 source (flux 2.35 3 106 a/cm2 per s). The internal
dose rate was computed from the U, Th and K contents using published values of specific dose-rates (Liritzis and Kokkoris, 1992; Valladas, 1988) and the S-a sensitivity determined experimentally. The external
dose-rate includes a cosmic contribution of 60 mGy/a (Prescott and Hutton, 1988). The TL signals were recorded with an automatic reader (Valladas et al., 1994): the blue component of the 380  C TL peak was
selected by a MTO 380 nm filter and detected with a EMI 9635QB photomultiplier tube. The heating rate was 5  /s. ED values were determined by comparing the first and second TL growth curves (Mercier et al.,
1992), since for most samples, the growth curve of the TL signal (TL versus acquired dose) was sub-linear whereas for the others, the shape was more linear. Typical examples of sub-linear growth curves are
shown in Fig. 2. All the flints listed have passed the plateau test (Aitken, 1985). The errors associated with the age estimates were computed according to Aitken (1985, appendix B).

mineralogical assemblage: the northern part of the Central
Area includes the squares G18-G19-H19-I20-J20; the southern
part, the squares K22-K23-K24-J24-I24-I23 and the Deep
Sounding, the squares D27-E27-E28-F28-F27. For each layer
and unit within a specific area, the average TL age value was
calculated (Table 2); since these layers do not represent single
but successive occupations, the associated error was obtained
by averaging the individual errors; in brackets, the standard
deviation of the individuals results is also given. Note, however, that samples from square D27 (Deep Sounding) were
all discarded because of the incoherence of the TL results,
ranging from w272 to w35 ka (!). This may well be related
to the presence of a 1.30-m-deep trench thought to be the
product of water driven erosion which resulted in redeposition
of younger sediments together with stone artefacts (Weiner
et al., 2002).
Beginning with the bottom of the sequence, samples
collected in the Deep Sounding from layer F (base and top)
result in two average ages which are statistically equivalent
(210  28 ka and 221  21 ka, respectively) (Table 2). Even
if these results seem coherent, one must note that layer F was
subjected to extensive chemical diagenesis that resulted in
the breakdown of the clays and the formation of authigenic silica, as demonstrated by Weiner et al. (2002). As discussed by
these authors, this process might be related to the erosional unconformity that marks the geological limit between the top of
layer F and the bottom of E, and indicates a period of abundant
water flow, especially at the entrance of the cave where the
Deep Sounding is located. Indeed, the fine-bedded nature of
the sediments exposed in the Deep Sounding, indicate deposition in standing water. Because clays and other mineral components are altered to a depth of more than 2 m below the
erosional unconformity in this area, one cannot rule out the
possibility of an increase of the g-dose-rate leading to an
under-estimation of the true deposition age. However, it is of
interest that the overlaying layer (Lower E) does not show signs
of such an alteration in this area and is dated to 186  20 ka.
It can then be deduced that the alteration was limited in time
to Oxygen Isotope Stage 7 (OIS-7), from 244 to 190 ka
(Martinson et al., 1987). In order to assess the magnitude of
this possible under-estimation, one can consider as an extreme
hypothesis that the environmental dose-rate in the Deep Sounding during OIS-7 was as low as those recorded in areas where
the CD assemblage has been identified (w500 mGy/a). Considering the data of Table 1, it can then be shown that such a scenario would lead to average ages of 224  29 ka and
231  22 ka for layer F (base and top, respectively). Thus,
the age of layer F (w210e220 ka) is possibly under-estimated
but it is likely that this under-estimation does not exceed 20 ka
and is similar in magnitude to the errors associated with the
mean ages.
Moving up in the stratigraphic sequence, the TL age of
Lower E in the Deep Sounding is 186  20 ka. This is statistically indistinguishable from the average values obtained
from the southern part of the Central Area for units 5 and 4
(160  22 ka and 168  21 ka, respectively), and is consistent
with the fact that these two units were both identified as

belonging to the Lower E complex and thus are expected to
have the same age. This result is also close to the average
age of unit 4 (176  26 ka) in the northern part. Lower E
was thus deposited at the beginning of OIS-6, a period which
seems to have been much drier than the previous one according to the state of preservation of the contemporaneous units,
especially in the Deep Sounding area, where these upper sediments are less diagenetically altered and commonly calcitic.
In the southern part of the Central Area, unit 3 is dated to
156  19 ka, indicating that the deposition of Upper E sediments followed those of Lower E without any interruption.
The dating of two samples assumed in the field to be derived
from unit 2 in this part, yielded a mean TL age (156  17 ka)
indistinguishable from those of unit 3. We assume therefore
that unit 2 was not present in the dated southern part of the
Central area. In reality the correlations between the top of
the Mousterian deposits in the southern section and those of
the northern section were difficult to establish due to their removal by the Natufian and Aurignacian occupations and the
earlier excavations of this area (1971e1979). In addition,
the dipping of the units in the northern section, possibly into
a sinkhole in the rear, was the reason for erroneous field correlations. Units 3 and 2 were TL-dated in the northern part and
the age estimates are 144  14 and 129  13 ka, respectively.
These last two results then show a clear-cut correlation with
the stratigraphy indicating a deposition of these units in the
second part of OIS-6.
6. Discussion and conclusions
We first compare the TL chronology with the most complete
and reliable age data published to date for Hayonim Cave,
namely from the combined ESR/U-series analyses (Rink
et al., 2004). The mean TL dates obtained for units 3e5 in
the southern part of the Central Area, when taking into account
the standard deviations, range from w135 ka to w185 ka. The
TL dates are therefore in fairly good agreement with the ESR

dates on teeth of the same units (Early uranium Uptake model
[EU]: 177  12 ka and Linear uranium Uptake model [LU]:
182  15 ka). The mean TL age of 156  19 ka obtained for
the uppermost unit (unit 3) also fits well with the U-series
age of a fallen calcite speleothem (155.3 þ 2.9 1.4 ka) found
at a higher elevation (Z ¼ 248) than all the dated samples. It
can thus be concluded that the Mousterian sequence in the
southern part of the Central Area, including layers Lower E
(units 5 and 4) and Upper E (unit 3), covers a minimum time
interval ranging from w185 ka to w135 ka ago. This range
is reproduced in the northern part for units 4e3 including the
base of E in the Deep Sounding, but in the north the youngest
unit (2) is also present with an age of 129  13 ka.
The dating of the erosional unconformity observed between
layer F and Lower E at Hayonim Cave is of particular interest.
According to the TL results, it is dated to w200 ka and thus
corresponds to the second part of OIS-7. This event was
marked by significant flow of water within the cave. It might
then be contemporaneous with one of the discontinuities
recorded in the sequence of Tabun cave that were already
described (Jelinek, 1982; Jelinek et al., 1973; Mercier et al.,
1995b). An important discontinuity between Unit I dated to
165  16 ka and Unit II dated to 196  21 ka (Mercier and
Valladas, 2003) reflects the introduction of the terra rosa
soil due to the opening of the chimney. Earlier unconformities
were noted in the stratigraphy of the inner chamber where
units IIeVIII accumulated following the deposition of Unit
IX (Jelinek, 1982, p.1370). Units IIeIX were attributed to
what was originally called layer D by Garrod. The TL dates
of these units are as follows: Unit V, 222  27 ka; Unit IX,
256  26 ka (Mercier and Valladas, 2003). Hence, the gap between Hayonim Lower E and F (both corresponding in their
industries to the generalized Layer D at Tabun) would fall between Unit II and Unit V and not as mentioned in a previous
paper (Weiner et al., 2002).
If these discontinuities represent the same series of climatic
events, they seem to appear at the same position within the

Levantine Mousterian sequence. In Hayonim Cave, the boundary is situated between layers F and Lower E, both of which
contain blade-rich Middle Paleolithic industries. Consequently, by comparing the chronologies and industries of Hayonim and Tabun caves, one can conclude that the former
sequence is likely more continuous than that of Tabun and
that the latter site was probably unoccupied during the first
part of OIS-6. It should be noted that subsidence is more dramatic in Tabun which also may explain gaps in the physical
stratigraphic record.
In sum, this study shows that the age of the Mousterian sequence in Hayonim Cave ranges from about 115 ka ago to at
least 220 ka. It also shows that the dating of samples such as
flints or teeth by dosimetric methods can be severely affected
by the proximity of mineral assemblage boundaries to the
samples and/or to the dosimeters used to measure the current
radiation dose. Without three-dimensional information on the
distributions of these mineral assemblages in the sediments,
the ages of the stratigraphic units in Hayonim Cave would
have been determined with much less precision and confidence
than those presented here, and would have certainly been less
reliable.
