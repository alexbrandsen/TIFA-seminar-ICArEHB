Abstract
In this paper I present the results of a micro-residue analysis of stone segments, the type fossils of the Howiesons Poort technocomplex in
South Africa, with an age of more than 60 ka at Sibudu Cave, KwaZulu-Natal. Fifty-three segments were systematically analysed and 1826
organic micro-residue occurrences were documented on the sample. The distribution patterns of micro-residues and other use-traces are interpreted in terms of hafting and function. It is shown that most of the tools were indeed hafted and most were probably used as inserts for hunting
weapons. There is evidence for differences and changes over time in haft materials and hafting configurations of the segments. The study demonstrates how functional studies could improve our understanding of change and variability in human behaviour during the Middle Stone Age,
a period that used to be portrayed as static or slow changing.

1. Introduction
Micro-residue analysis of stone tools, using light microscopy, is increasingly used to solve Stone Age behavioural
questions (for example, Fullagar et al., 2006; Hardy, 2004;
Hardy et al., 2001; Williamson, 2005). Analysts are developing and refining methods based on distinct research questions
or focus areas (for example, Hardy and Garufi, 1998; Haslam,
2004, 2006; Horrocks and Weisler, 2006; Lombard and
Wadley, 2007; Pearsall et al., 2004; Piperno et al., 2004;
Rots and Williamson, 2004; Therin, 1998; Wadley et al.,
2004). These developments are providing increased accuracy
and confidence in the approach, and are highlighting areas
where caution is required. Sometimes it is possible to gain detailed understanding of stone tool functions and associated
hafting technologies (Gibson et al., 2004; Lombard, 2004,
2006a,b). Where sites have good organic preservation, and

tools are extracted with micro-residue research in mind, the
method can be used to solve riddles of the past. One such conundrum exists around the geometric baked tools from the Howiesons Poort (HP) technocomplex of South Africa (see
Lombard, 2005a, and references therein). The HP has been described as ‘a remarkably precocious lithic entity’ (Butzer,
1982), ‘transient’ (Deacon and Shuurman, 1992), ‘unnecessarily burdensome and complex’ (Vishnyatsky, 1994), ‘most puzzling’ (Mitchell, 2002), ‘anomalous’ (Parkington, 2006), and
the dating at the name site as ‘an unsolved mystery’ (Deacon,
1995). The HP puzzle is mainly centred around the existence
of an unusually early blade technology with geometric backed
tools, sometimes also described as microlithic. These backed
tools are reminiscent of Later Stone Age or Upper Palaeolithic
industries although they occur thousands of years earlier and
are followed by what is often interpreted as a less sophisticated
Middle Stone Age (MSA) flake-based technology (e.g. Parkington, 2006; Singer and Wymer, 1982; Soriano et al., 2007).
By the time of the HP e about 60 ka ago e people in South
Africa were anatomically modern (Homo sapiens) (e.g.

M. Lombard / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 26e41

Deacon and Wurz, 2005; Grün and Beaumont, 2001; Marrean
and Assefa, 2005; McBrearty and Brooks, 2000; Wadley,
2006a). New archaeological information is becoming available, providing better understanding of the HP timeframe
and some cultural aspects (Ambrose, 2006; Gibson et al.,
2004; Lombard, 2006b; Minichillo, 2006; Parkington et al.,
2005; Rigaud et al., in press; Soriano et al., 2007; Valladas
et al., 2005; Vogel, 2001; Wadley, 2005, 2006a; Wurz,
2002). Segments (sometimes also referred to as crescents or
lunates) are the type fossils for the HP technocomplex, and understanding their use and associated hafting technologies
could further contribute to our knowledge of this period.
Thus, a series of functional studies have been conducted on
HP backed tools (Delagnes et al., 2006; Gibson et al., 2004;
Lombard, 2005b, 2006b; Wurz and Lombard, in press). Here
I present the results of an assemblage-level micro-residue
analysis of all the unwashed segments from the HP layers at
Sibudu Cave, KwaZulu-Natal. Organic material, and by extension residues on stone tools, is extraordinarily well preserved
at Sibudu Cave making this the ideal assemblage for the project. An interpretation of how these tools could have been used
and hafted is provided.

2. The Howiesons Poort at Sibudu Cave
Sibudu Cave (Fig. 1) has a long sequence of MSA occupations with stone tool assemblages that can be attributed to
a pre-Still Bay phase, a Still Bay technocomplex, a Howiesons
Poort technocomplex, a post-Howiesons Poort phase, and late
and final MSA phases (Fig. 2). I focus here only on the HP of
Sibudu Cave that has been excavated from the 2 m2 trial excavation, but site descriptions and various aspects of ongoing

27

research are widely published and readers are referred to
Wadley (2006b), Wadley and Jacobs (2004, 2006) and the references therein. Ages for the older industries, including the HP
are not yet finalised, but they fit within Oxygen Isotope Stage
(ISO) 4. A large suite of layers with post-HP assemblages at
Sibudu Cave have a weighted mean average optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age of 60.1  1.5 ka (Wadley and
Jacobs, 2006). The implication is that either the end of the
HP at Sibudu Cave is older than this, or that the technocomplex here moves seamlessly into an industry lacking backed
tools (Wadley, 2006b). Stratigraphically the HP succeeds the
Still Bay for which a preliminary OSL age falls within the
range published for the Still Bay at Blombos Cave (Jacobs
et al., 2003a,b, 2006; Tribolo et al., 2005, 2006), somewhere
between 75 and 73 ka ago. It is not yet known whether there
is a hiatus between the HP and the Still Bay at Sibudu Cave
(Wadley, 2006b). The HP occurs in layers PGS (the deepest
HP layer), GS2, GS, GR2 and GR (the uppermost HP layer)
and is rich in stone artefacts. No retouched points were excavated from these layers. Segments and other backed tools represent the formal component of the assemblage. The majority
of the backed tools are manufactured on dolerite and hornfels,
although there are also some quartz artefacts (Delagnes et al.,
2006). A higher proportion of blades and more large sandstone
flakes than the more recent assemblages accompany the backed
tools from Sibudu Cave (Wadley, 2006b).
Bone point fragments that can be refitted have been recovered from the HP layers (Wadley, 2006b). Bone, in general, is
less fragmented in the HP layers than the bone in younger
layers, and possible geomorphological and taphonomical reasons for this are discussed in Cain (2006) and Schiegl and
Conard (2006). Faunal analyses of the HP layers are incomplete, but preliminary indications are that the animals

represented during the period include a wide range of species,
with the blue duiker (Cephalophus monticola) predominating.
Some worked marine shell is also present in the HP layers.
Shells are, however, not abundant, and do not appear to represent food remains. Rather, it seems likely that it was deliberately transported from the coast as a raw material (Plug,
2006). Well-preserved circular and sub-circular hearths are
present throughout the Sibudu Cave sequence. The small

area from which the HP has been recovered prevents an accurate description of the spatial distribution of its hearths. Nevertheless, they are easily recognisable as separate features and
seem to be more sparsely dispersed in these layers compared
with the younger layers. ISO 4 (75e64 ka) represents a cool
event during which there was a 60e70 m fall in sea level
(Wadley and Jacobs, 2006). Other proxy environmental data
indicate a humid climate for the cave with surrounding

M. Lombard / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 26e41

evergreen forests during the HP (Allott, 2006; Glenny, 2006;
Schiegl and Conard, 2006; Wadley, 2006b).
3. Sample and method
The sample for this study comprises all the unwashed HP
segments (n ¼ 53). I excavated the tools and placed them in
airtight plastic bags immediately after removal from the soil.
They were not touched, washed or marked subsequent to excavation. Soil samples were collected from the HP layers and
microscope slides were prepared for each soil sample and photographed under the same magnifications and lighting conditions as the residues on the tools. This procedure provides
a record of the microscopic morphology of the matrix from
which the tools were retrieved that can be used to compare
with the residues or matrix adhering to the tools. The tools
and soil samples were microscopically examined at magnifications ranging from 50 to 500 using an Olympus BX40 stereo binocular metallographic microscope with analysing and
polarising filters, and bright and dark field, incident light sources. A digital camera attachment was used as a recording aid.
Micro-residues are identified in situ by means of their morphological characteristics and within the framework of
a multi-stranded approach (Lombard, 2004, 2005c; Lombard
and Wadley, 2007; Wadley and Lombard, 2007). Appendix
A provides a brief overview of the morphological criteria by
which micro-residue types are identified and interpreted. Further criteria and more extensive descriptions of some residue
types are provided by other analysts (e.g. Barton et al.,
1998; Briuer, 1976; Fullagar, 1988, 1998, 2006; Fullagar
et al., 2006; Hardy and Garufi, 1998; Haslam, 2004, 2006;
Jahren et al., 1997; Kealhofer et al., 1999; Piperno and Holst,
1998; Piperno et al., 2000; Shafer and Holloway, 1979).
To establish the distribution patterns of residues and the

29

relationships between various micro-residue types on the segments I divide each tool into six portions (Fig. 3). Each portion
includes a dorsal and ventral side. The segments are placed
with their dorsal sides facing upwards, but because proximal
and distal ends are often difficult or impossible to distinguish,
they are all placed with their backed edges to the left. The portions are referred to as upper blade (portion 1), medial blade
(portion 2), lower blade (portion 3), lower back (portion 4),
medial back (portion 5) and upper back (portion 6). The entire
dorsal and ventral surfaces, including the edges, of each tool
are systematically scanned under the microscope. All microresidues are recorded, plotted and counted as occurrences in
relation to the portions described above. In this context an occurrence is any identifiable residue or cluster of a residue type.
For example, because of the high probability of contamination
with regard to starch grains, single grains are not recorded as
use related residues, but, within the framework of the multistranded approach, a cluster of starch grains will be counted
as a single starch occurrence. The interpretation is amplified
if there are additional plant residues such as plant tissue or fibres in close association with the starch grain cluster. This approach is followed with all residue types. Clusters with very
small fragmented, superimposed residues such as a concentration of fragmentary plant tissue or a cluster of small bone
fragments are also counted as single occurrences. Relatively
large residue deposits or fragments, such as pieces of plant
tissue, woody residue, animal tissue or bone fragments constitute single occurrences. Although this method cannot be
considered an accurate quantification of the residues, it does
provide a realistic reflection of the distribution patterns and
concentrations of micro-residues on the tools. This method
highlights the possible existence of micro-residue and other
use-trace distribution patterns and serves as a basis for further
interpretation.

segments (Fig. 6); 83.5% of all the plant residues are here
(and 67% of the plant residue component comprises resin or
gum).
Because of the different trends in the distribution patterns of
animal and plant residues, we can infer that they accumulated
on the segments as a result of different applications or use actions (Fig. 7). The backed portions of segments are usually considered to have facilitated hafting. This interpretation is based
on previous use-trace analyses conducted on tools with similar
morphology, as well as ethnographic and archaeological examples (Goodwin, 1945; Clark et al., 1974; Phillipson, 1976;
Clark, 1977; Becker and Wendorf, 1993; Bocquentin and
Bar-Yosuf, 2004; Gibson et al., 2004). A parallel study, involving the analysis of the distribution patterns of ochre and resin
residues on the same sample, provided direct evidence for
the hafting of these tools using an adhesive containing these
two ingredients. It was shown that 80% of the ochre occurrences and 87% of the resin occurrences are located on the
backed portions of the sample (Lombard, 2006b).

4. Results and interpretations
4.1. Distribution patterns of micro-residues
On the sample of 53 tools, 1826 organic micro-residue
occurrences were documented. These do not include plant
residue types associated with evidence for rootlet or fungal
growth on nine tools in the sample. Table 1 shows the distribution of all the organic residues (ochre residues and their association with resin have been discussed elsewhere; Lombard,
2006b). Animal residues include animal tissue, fatty residue,
collagen, bone residue, blood residue and hair fragments,
while plant residues include plant tissue, plant fibres, starchy
residue and starch grains, woody residue and resin. Most of
the animal residues are concentrated on the blade (sharp, cutting) portions of the segments. This is especially true for animal tissue (84%), collagen (67%), blood residue (84%) and
hair fragments (89%): such high percentages on these portions
cannot be considered coincidental. The distribution patterns
of fatty and bone residues are less distinct. On the one hand,
the line graphs show how animal residues such as tissue,
collagen, blood and hair tend to be poorly represented on
the backed portions (Fig. 4). On the other hand, bone representation increases slightly on these backed portions of the segments, while fat does not display a clear distribution pattern
(Fig. 5). There is a high fat and marrow content in bone and
replication work shows that fatty residues on stone tools often
result when they are used to process bone (own observation of
residues on replicated tools). Fat and bone residues are thus
closely associated, and might occur as a result of the same activity. However, fatty residues can easily be distributed as a result of handling the tools with greasy hands. Fatty residue
distribution patterns might therefore be most accurately interpreted in conjunction with associated animal residues. Plant
residues are concentrated on the backed portions of the

4.2. Haft materials
With most of the plant residues located on the backed portions it seems reasonable to infer that the tools were hafted to
wooden handles or shafts. However, replications for a blind
test showed that a range of plant residue types could be expected within resin or tree gum. When gum is collected
from trees pieces of wood, bark and plant fibres are unintentionally incorporated in the gum (Lombard and Wadley,
2007). Furthermore, resin or gum sometimes degenerates
into a granular whitish residue that includes starch grains
(Fig. 8). This calls for caution when interpreting haft materials
or tool function related to the processing of starch-rich materials. Using multiple lines of micro-residue evidence, as discussed in Lombard and Wadley (2007) and Wadley and

Lombard (2007), and including information from other usetraces such as usewear and macrofractures (see Fischer
et al., 1984; Lombard, 2005c, 2006a; Rots, 2003, 2005; Rots
et al., 2006), the single tools were interpreted for hafting
and function. The data were interpreted according to the
macro-stratigraphic divisions of the HP layers at Sibudu, i.e.,
GR and GR2 the uppermost HP layers (n of tools ¼ 11), GS
and GS2 the middle HP layers (n of tools ¼ 20) and PGS
the oldest HP layer (n of tools ¼ 20) (Table 2). Two tools included in the analysis presented in Table 1 are not from
bona fide HP layers. One is from YA2 the layer immediately
above the HP and the other from RGS the layer immediately
below the HP.
More than half (54.5%) of the tools from GR and GR2
show multiple strands of evidence for wood hafting. A further
27% show evidence for being hafted, in the form of adhesive
residues and other use-traces, but the abundance and distribution patterns of their micro-residues do not clearly indicate
their haft materials. One tool from these layers shows no evidence for hafting. Of the 20 tools from layers GS and GS2
15% could be interpreted as having been hafted into wooden
hafts and 10% have evidence for possible bone hafting. For
60% of the segments the hafting material could not be

identified, and four tools appear not to have been hafted at
all. The segments from layer PGS seem to be telling a different
story. Here, 50% of the tools show evidence for possible bone
hafting, while none show clear evidence for wood hafting. For
40% of the segments in PGS I was unable to identify the haft
materials, and two tools were probably not hafted. If the interpretations of variation in haft materials are correct, the implications are far-reaching. However, we have to consider all
other possibilities before bone hafting for the earliest HP
layers at Sibudu Cave can be claimed, and I return to this issue
in a later section.

4.3. Processed materials and tool function
One of the main aims of the micro-residue analysis and
other functional studies on this sample was to determine
whether the tools were used as inserts for hafted hunting
weapons. Although direction, layering or fragmentation could
provide clues, micro-residues alone can seldom be used to distinguish between use actions such as scraping, cutting, sawing,
drilling, piercing or impact use (hunting). These actions can,
however, be determined with further use-trace studies such

as macrofracture and usewear analyses. Therefore, the term
‘processed’ here refers only to the materials on which the tools
were used and incorporates the use of the stone artefacts as
tips or barbs for hunting weapons. At present I can also not
distinguish between true projectile weapons or hand-delivered
weapons on the basis of use-trace analyses. Because of the

current debate regarding the origins of projectile weapon systems (e.g. Brooks et al., 2006; Shea, 2006; Villa and Lenoir,
2006), I favour the general term ‘hunting weapon’ until
more direct evidence becomes available that might indicate
the exclusive use of either system for a tool class or period.
Moreover, it is my current opinion that the morphological
characteristics and functional evidence for HP segments do
not favour one or the other weapon system, and that these tools
could have been used as inserts for both projectile and handdelivered weapons in a variable hunting technology.
The main micro-residue indicators for stone tools that were
used in hafted hunting weapons are the presence and distribution patterns of animal residues. Residue types such as hair, collagen, blood, animal tissue, bone and fat could be expected on
the tips or along the cutting edges of tools that were used to kill
or wound animals. Over a period of three years much attention
was paid to resolving problems concerning the preservation and
identification of animal residues and the microscopic, morphological distinction between plant and animal residues. Thus,
a series of replication projects and blind tests have aided the interpretations presented here (Lombard et al., 2004; Lombard
and Wadley, 2007; Wadley and Lombard, 2007). As already
mentioned, there is a clear accumulation of animal residues
on the blade portions of the segments indicating the processing
of animal material. For layers GR and GR2 54.5% (n ¼ 6) of the
tools show evidence for animal processing. Of the remaining
tools one tool could have been used to process plant material,
two tools could have been used to process both plant and animal
materials, and three tools seem not to have been used at all
(Table 2).
Based on the evidence presented, it seems that HP segments
at Sibudu Cave were hafted and used mostly for the processing
(either butchering or hunting) of animal material. However,
usewear traces showed very little indication of cutting, sawing
or scraping and the segments do not show convincing traces
indicating that they have been used as knives or for scraping
hides. Most of the cutting edges of the segments remained remarkably sharp with only some linear striations on their edges
and surfaces. These striations and the lack of well-developed
usewear are often noted as characteristics of hunting tools
(Fischer et al., 1984; Kay, 1996; Lombard, 2005b). A macrofracture analysis of all the backed tools and fragments
(n ¼ 132) from the HP at Sibudu Cave, including the segments
analysed for micro-residues, shows that 24% has fractures that
can be considered diagnostic of impact (hunting) use (Fischer
et al., 1984; Lombard, 2005b, 2006c).
Thus, if we take the accompanying usewear and macrofracture evidence into account that could be considered characteristic for hunting weapons, 63.5% of the segments in the
youngest HP layers, GR and GR2 were probably used as inserts in hunting weapons. Micro-residues indicate that 90%
of the tools in older HP layers GS and GS2, were used to process animal material. I could not detect any evidence on these
segments for plant processing or multifunctional use on plant
and animal materials. One tool showed evidence for being
used, but I was unable to determine the processed material,
and 85% could have functioned as inserts for hunting weapons

M. Lombard / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 26e41

on the grounds of cumulative use-trace evidence (Table 2). Of
the 20 segments from the oldest HP layer, PGS, 90% show evidence for processing animal material, while none show clear
indications for the exclusive processing of plant material. One
tool from PGS could have been used to process both plant and
animal materials. From this layer 75% of the tools could have
been used as inserts in hunting weapons on the grounds of cumulative use-trace evidence (Table 2). When micro-residue,
usewear and macrofracture evidence is combined, we have
good reason to assume that the main intention for the production of HP segments was to insert them into composite (composite ¼ hafted, not necessarily implying multiple stone
inserts) hunting weapons. Of course, this interpretation cannot
be extended to all backed tool types from the HP until focused
research has been conducted on them.
4.4. Hafting positions
Previously, I have suggested that HP backed tools were
probably used as interchangeable pieces, such as tips, barbs
or cutting inserts in composite hunting weapons (Lombard,
2006c). This suggestion was based on the results of macrofracture analyses on backed tools from three HP assemblages e
Sibudu Cave, Umhlatuzana Rock Shelter and Klasies River
Cave 2 e and the comparison of these results to those from
other archaeological assemblages and from replicated tools.
The micro-residue analysis of the unwashed segments from Sibudu Cave confirms the possibility of variation in hafting

configurations, but it is not possible to distinguish between
some of the suggested hafting positions. For example, if the
segments were hafted transversely (Fig. 9), as pairs to form
a point consisting of two stone inserts (Fig. 10), or longitudinally as single or multiple cutting inserts (Fig. 11), the distribution patterns of adhesive residues could be similar e along
the backed portions of the segments. However, if some segments were hafted diagonally, as barbed tips or diagonal
barbed cutting inserts (Fig. 12), residues associated with hafting might be concentrated on the medial backed portion and
on either the upper or lower backed portions with some
spill-over associated residues on the corresponding bladed
portions.
Table 2 presents my interpretation for the hafting positions
of the segments according to their stratigraphic layers. This interpretation is based on the micro-residue distribution patterns
and in some cases, usewear traces such as polish, edge rounding, edge damage and the direction of striations on the tools.
45.5% of the GR and GR2 segments, show signs of longitudinal, transverse or pair hafting, and 45.5% could have been
hafted diagonally (9% were possibly not hafted). GS and
GS2 have more segments that were probably hafted diagonally
(50%), than segments that were hafted in other configurations
(25%). For one tool that was probably hafted I could not establish its hafting position. Segments from PGS were mostly hafted

in longitudinal, transverse or paired configurations (50%), with
30% of the tools showing evidence for diagonal hafting. For two
tools from PGS I was unable to establish their hafting positions.
Thus, not only does there seem to be variability in haft materials
over time at Sibudu, but also in preferred hafting configurations.
The size ranges and/or morphology of the segments might have
influenced their hafting positions. When the data from morphometric and technological studies, currently being conducted on
the same sample by co-researchers, become available we might
be able to assess if differences in production and morphology
also indicate chronological variability, and whether segments
of different size and morphology could have been hafted
differently.
4.5. The possibility of bone hafting and other
explanations

Fig. 11. Hypothetical reconstruction of backed tools hafted longitudinally as
cutting inserts after Clark and Prince (1974).

Mineralogical studies conducted on soil samples from
Sibudu Cave show that microscopic bone particles, in various
stages of degradation and burning, are common in the sediments (Schiegl et al., 2004) and that fat is also present (Schiegl,

M. Lombard / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 26e41

pers. comm.). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
transmitted polarising light, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM-EDAX techniques) and phytolith analyses all show minor degrees of diagenesis of the Sibudu Cave sediments. This
is further demonstrated in the rarity of authigenic phosphate
minerals and the occurrence of gypsum and calcite. Little loss
of bone due to dissolution can be expected in such a sedimentary
milieu (Schiegl and Conard, 2006). Thus, bone is remarkably
well preserved at Sibudu Cave, especially in the older layers,
such as GR and below, where the deposits are enriched with calcite and where gypsum is almost absent (Wadley, 2006b).
Although there is relatively less charcoal present in the
lower layers, such as the HP, the preservation of internal structures of the charcoal is good, and there simply seem to be
fewer hearths in the HP than in the younger layers (Allott,
2006). In spite of this, the preservation of charcoal might
not be an ideal indicator for the preservation of plant material
in general. One possible explanation for the decreasing evidence for wood hafting or plant processing could thus be
that plant residues was preserved less well in the lower HP
layers than in the upper HP layers. Table 3 shows a microresidue count according to the stratigraphy demonstrating
that there is not much difference in the occurrences or percentages of plant residues, and therefore probably in the preservation of plant micro-residues. In fact, PGS has the highest over
all percentage (42%) of plant residue occurrences on its tools
(mostly resin). Yet, most plant tissue residues (86%) and
woody residues (66%) occur on tools from the GR layers.
Plant tissue occurs markedly less on tools from the GS layers
(10%) and PGS (4%), while woody residues seem to show
a more gradual decline, with 66% for GR and GR2, 24.5%
for GS and GS2 and 9.5% for PGS. This is in line with the interpretation that segments from the upper HP layers were
probably hafted to wooden hafts, segments form the GS layers
possibly to both wood and bone hafts, and those from the PGS
layers mostly to bone hafts.
It could be argued that the distribution patterns of bone and
fatty residues might indicate the use of bone tools to blunt the
backs of the segments. The layering of residues provides some
clues to counter this argument. Microscopic bone flakes were
mostly observed superimposed on the ochre/resin residues
(Fig. 13). This layered pattern indicates that the adhesive was
in-between the stone artefact and the bone. It also shows that
the bone was not deposited before the adhesive was applied,
which would have been the case if bone tools were used to shape

the segments. Then again, it could be argued that this layering
pattern could indicate that the bone flakes were deposited onto
the tools as a result of post-depositional contact with bone particles in the soil. As discussed earlier, bone particles are indeed
common in the soil composition of Sibudu Cave. However, most
bone ‘crumbs’ in the soil are smaller than the bone residues on
the tools interpreted as use or hafting related. The bone particles
in the soil are also often burnt and degraded with rounded edges,
the latter probably resulting from abrasion with the sand in
which it was deposited. In contrast, the bone residues on the
tools, interpreted as implying use or hafting, have a ‘fresh’ appearance with sharp, angular edges, are un-burnt, and compare
well with modern bone residues on replicated stone tools used
to process bone (Fig. 14).
I do not suggest that the data and arguments presented here
for bone hafting during the HP, more than 60 ka ago, are conclusive. But, I do propose that there is a distinct possibility for bone
hafting during at least part of this industry. This possibility could
stimulate future exploration into the hafting positions of HP segments, or how we envision the hafted tools that HP segments
were part of. From the bone point fragments recovered from
an HP layer at Sibudu Cave we already know that bone was
worked at the site during this period. Future inspection of the
fragmented HP bone material from Sibudu Cave, or other Middle Stone Age sites with HP tools and good organic preservation,
might provide further evidence for bone being used as a raw material for shaped tools, or for hafts for stone tools.
5. Discussion and conclusion
In summary, the results of the micro-residue study on segments from Sibudu Cave indicate that
 Most HP segments were hafted.
 There might have been variability in haft materials over
time; the oldest HP segments could have been hafted to
bone and the youngest ones to wood.
 HP segments were probably hafted in different positions in
their hafts, and there might have been differences in preferred hafting configurations during different phases of
the HP at Sibudu Cave.
 HP segments were mostly used throughout the HP sequence to process animal material.
 Based on additional use-trace evidence, there are strong
indications that HP segments were mainly used as inserts
(tips, barbs or cutting inserts) for composite hunting
weapons.
 There is little evidence for HP segments from Sibudu Cave
having been used regularly as cutting, scraping or drilling
instruments.
 Residue distribution patterns cannot be used to distinguish
between segments that were hafted longitudinally, transversely or as pairs, because micro-residues might accumulate
similarly as a result of all or any these hafting configurations.
Preliminary impressions of the HP faunal material indicate
a wide range of species, with the little blue duiker well

represented. Wadley (2006b) suggests that such tiny forest
dwellers could have been trapped rather than hunted with
spears or even arrows. If we accept the interpretation for the
principal hunting function of segments and Wadley’s suggestion for the use of traps as reflecting real scenarios for meat
procurement, it implies that people used highly variable and

specialised hunting technologies more than 60 ka ago. While
previous research of the post-HP lithic and faunal assemblages
at the site indicated skilful and effective hunting for the period
since 60 ka ago (Lombard, 2005c; Plug, 2004), we now have
some evidence for such behaviour prior to that. The faunal
analysis, once completed, will no doubt help to assess these

interpretations, and could provide further information on possible variation in hunting strategies.
The HP of South Africa represents a relative short period
in the Middle Stone Age sequence. With the results of new
dating techniques its parameters are consistently being
narrowed down. Currently the approximate age range lies between 55 and 65 ka (Feathers, 2002; Rigaud et al., in press;
Tribolo et al., 2006; Valladas et al., 2005; Vogel, 2001),
with variations of slightly older or slightly younger HP assemblages at some sites (Rigaud et al., in press; Valladas et al.,
2005). Almost two decades ago Wadley and Harper (1989)
predicted that the HP might contain a developmental sequence
comprising two or three phases at Rose Cottage Cave based
on their re-analysis of Malan’s collection. This suggestion
was recently confirmed with a technological analysis on material excavated more recently by Wadley (1991, 1996, 1997).
Soriano et al. (2007) distinguished between three HP phases
at Rose Cottage Cave, and they conclude that the sequence indicates a slow, gradual abandonment of the technological
style of the HP and the adoption of a post-HP technology
that is somewhat similar to that of the European Middle
Palaeolithic.
While the detailed interpretations for function and hafting
provided here remain promising explanations for the cumulative functional data, the micro-residue analysis on the HP assemblage from Sibudu Cave supports change over time within
the technocomplex. Future technological and morphometric
analyses on the same sample will add to these data and serve
as crosschecks for the interpretations based on the use-trace
analyses. Considering previous perceptions of an invariable,
slow changing Middle Stone Age in southern Africa, it is noteworthy that we are now able to provide evidence to the contrary. If we accept that people in southern Africa behaved in
a modern way at least since about 75 ka ago (Henshilwood
and d’Errico, 2005), we ought to expect that evidence for variability, change and complexity in their behaviours will become increasingly evident in the archaeological record. It is
understood that evidence for the presence of these traits (variability, change and complexity) do not provide conclusive evidence for ‘fully symbolic sapiens behaviour’ (Henshilwood
and d’Errico, 2005). But, their discernible traces in the MSA
record of South Africa assist in doing away with previous notions of simple, unchanging technologies and subsistence
patterns.

Appendix A
Because of the challenging nature of distinguishing some
plant and animal residues using light microscopy, and the difficulty of separating use residues from contaminants, I consistently seek multi-stranded evidence for the identification of
residues (Lombard and Wadley, 2007; Wadley and Lombard,
2007). The repetitive clustering of attendant residues, for example, the combination of fat, blood, bone, and animal tissue
in on a tool portion provides a far more secure interpretation of
an animal residue type than any single residue. Currently, I do
not consider tools with a single residue or single residue type,
such as individual or isolated starch grains without associated
plant tissue or fibres, as feasible for detailed residue analysis.
This is particularly relevant in archaeological contexts where
some residues may be partially degraded and where the potential of ancient, post-depositional or post-excavation contaminants is high. Thus, the criteria below are mostly considered
within this multi-stranded approach, and final interpretations
are only ventured once all variables on the tool surfaces
have been considered.
A.1. Plant residues
A.1.1. Plant tissue
Given the fragmented and sometimes degraded nature of
residues the cell structure or remaining silica skeletons itself
cannot provide specific identifications (wood, bark, fibre).
However, the general morphology, cellulose (an insoluble
complex carbohydrate), birefringence (the double refraction
of incident light), and the presence of starch grains or other
identifiable plant residues indicate a residue of plant origin.
A.1.2. Plant fibres
Plant or cellulose fibres usually consist of long, slender
cells that commonly occur in ribbon-like strands or fibrous
bundles. The cellulose strands often appear as broken twisted
fibres, with shattered ends. Such breaks can seem straight and
abrupt. Fibres are likely to be sclerenchyma tissue (a supporting tissue), which may develop in any or all parts of the primary and secondary plant bodies (Raven et al., 1992). Plant
fibres often appear bright under cross-polarised light and are
birefringent (also see Fullagar, 2006).
A.1.3. Starchy residue
This is an amorphous granular starch deposit, often with no
visible plant cell structure. It might starch grains. The residue
could result from cooking, heating or decomposition of starchrich plant portions such as tubers, roots and seeds (Williamson, n.d.). New research also indicates that this residue type
could result from decomposed or macerated woody residue
and from decomposed resin or tree gum.

38

M. Lombard / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 26e41

A.1.4. Starch grains
Starch grains are usually spherical, and under cross-polarised light, exhibit a characteristic extinction cross as the result
of the birefringence of the grain. The extinction cross will not
always be visible if heating or degradation has modified the
starch grain (Wadley and Lombard, 2007). It will also not be
visible if the orientation of the starch grain is such that the hilum (the part of a starch grain around which the starch is laid
down in more or less concentric layers) is not at the top of the
grain (Williamson, pers. com.). Starch grains are mostly less
than 50 mm in maximum dimension, and could be as small
as only 1 mm. Thus, surface features of starch grains should
be viewed under transmitted light at 200 magnification or
higher (Fullagar, 2006). Their association with starch grains
can often support the identification of plant residues such as
plant tissue, woody residue, starchy residue or resin. Without
the association with other plant residues and repetitive clustering, starch grains are not considered an indication of contact
with starch-rich plant material because of the possibility of
their presence in the matrix, their similarity to fungal spores
or modern contamination (e.g. Barton et al., 1998; Haslam,
2004, 2006; Rots and Williamson, 2004).
A.1.5. Epidermal cell tissue
The often rectangular, brickwork-like cell structure and pattern of silica skeletons indicate bark or outer stem layers of the
primary plant body. The ground mass of epidermal cells are
compactly arranged and covered with a cuticle of cutin (a fatty
substance) and wax (Raven et al., 1992).
A.1.6. Woody residue
The presence of vessels, bundles of vessels, and cell structure consisting of tracheids (elongated, conducting and supporting cells), and parenchyma (living thin-walled cells)
indicates secondary xylem (wood) (Raven et al., 1992).
Woody residue appears rigid with abrupt, straight breaks usually along cell edges. Sometimes fibres and starch grains are
observed together with woody residue.
A.1.7. Resin or gum
Resin or gum films can have a glassy transparent appearance and are often dark in colour. The deposit indicates the
fluid or viscous nature of the residue and can appear like small
smooth droplets or have a cracked appearance. The cracks are
usually straight-edged and clear. The residue might also appear birefringent. Starch grains, woody residue, plant fibres,
epidermal cells and other plant cells are often recorded within
a resinous deposit (Fullagar, 2006; Lombard and Wadley,
2007).
A.2. Animal residues
A.2.1. Animal tissue
Clear cell structure is seldom visible and
comes dull or opaque when the polarizer is
are sometimes visible. The colour of animal
from pale yellow to dark brown, but whitish

the residue berotated. Nuclei
tissue can vary
fibres, fat cells

or collagen fragments often accompany pigmented animal
tissue.
A.2.2. Muscle tissue
Muscle tissue is best identified in longitudinal sections
where skeletal muscle cells or fibres show cross-striations of
alternating light and dark bands. The darker bands are anisotropic (physical properties depend upon relative direction to
axes), and therefore birefringent under cross-polarised light
due to the ordered myosin (large asymmetric protein) molecules of the thick filaments (Junqueira et al., 1998). Skeletal
muscle fibres are extremely elongated, unbranched cylindrical
cells (Young and Heath, 2002).
A.2.3. Collagen
Collagen is found in most supporting faunal tissues and is
mostly fibrous. Parallel collagen fibrils are arranged into strong
bundles 2e10 mm in diameter (Young and Heath, 2002). Thus,
collagen fibres often have the appearance of rope and the ends
may appear unravelled. The orientation of the elongated tropocollagen molecules in collagen fibres makes them birefringent,
but under plane polarised light they often appear opaque. Some
collagen bundles may display structured layers (Junqueira et al.,
1998). Certain collagen types do not form fibrils but rather have
a mesh-like structure (Young and Heath, 2002) sometimes described as sheet collagen.
A.2.4. Animal fat/marrow
Fat (adipose tissue) and marrow cells have distinctive globular or ovoid shapes. When crushed or smeared the tissue becomes amorphous but the smear itself can be detected.
Unilocular (common or yellow) adipose tissue is composed of
cells that contain one large central droplet of yellow fat in their
cytoplasm. Multilocular (or brown) adipose tissue is composed
of cells that contain numerous lipid droplets and abundant
brown mitochondria (Junqueira et al., 1998). In marrow deposits, bright red erythrocytes occur, which are responsible for
platelet formation (Young and Heath, 2002). In archaeological
samples these brown and red spots can sometimes be detected
within a whitish deposit and indicate the faunal origin of the residue. Fat and marrow could appear birefringent on the surface,
but often becomes opaque when the polarizer is rotated. These
residues are sometimes bluish under cross-polarised light.
A.2.5. Bone
Jahren et al. (1997) found bone to have an amorphous,
greasy appearance that lacked characteristic structure. I found
that fatty bone deposits are white, but could have a blue or
greenish tinge. Bone fragments are often amorphous and opaque, but bone residues from degraded, non-fatty bone can appear translucent. The fragments usually have sharp, jagged
edges and might show small perforations under magnifications
of 200 or more.
A.2.6. Blood
Blood residues are indicated by the characteristic mudcracking of thick films, colour and/or the presence of red blood

M. Lombard / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 26e41

cells. Blood films are relatively reflective and may range in
colour from yellow, for thin films, to red or black, for thicker
deposits. The cracking of thick blood films results from the
protein component. Red blood cells or erythrocytes can sometimes be observed in blood deposits. They are recognised by
their biconcave disc shape with an average diameter of
7.2 mm (Young and Heath, 2002). On drying, they may be
smaller (between 3 and 5 mm) and the edges of the cells
may become crenated or ruffled.
A.2.7. Hair
This residue type is positively identified based on the cylindrical structure, the presence of medullae (central regions) and
sometimes the scaly cuticle or outer layer. Unless deeply
pigmented, keratin has a pale blue birefringence in crosspolarised light (Fullagar, 2006).
