Clear examples of tools used to artiﬁcially ignite ﬁre are virtually absent in the archaeological record until
the late Upper Palaeolithic. One explanation is that, until this point, hominins were (by and large) simply
ﬁre users dependent on the environment to provide conﬂagrations for exploitation, as opposed to ﬁre
producers. An alternate scenario is that the tools they used to perform this task are difﬁcult to recognise
in artefact assemblages. To account for this, we propose the ’expedient strike-a-light model’, a concept
that draws inspiration from the apparent ad hoc nature of many hunter-gatherer lithic technologies,
especially those of the Middle Palaeolithic. The model contends early ﬂint strike-a-lights were not formalised or specialised tools used to kindle multiple ﬁres, as seen in later time periods. Instead, we
postulate that ﬂakes, retouched implements or other fragments made from siliceous lithic raw materials
were utilised on a very short-term basis in conjunction with the minerals marcasite or pyrite (sulphuric
iron) to generate ﬁre. Building on previous research and our own experimental data, we establish criteria
to identify expedient ﬁre-lighting tools, and discuss the testing of our research model on ﬁve Middle
Palaeolithic assemblages. Although results were negative from this limited data set, this research offers
an alternative view of early ﬁre production and a protocol for recognising expedient strike-a-light
technology.

1. Introduction
There is widespread agreement that the ability to ignite and
control ﬁre was crucial to hominin cultural and (perhaps) physical
evolution, but there is no agreement about when humans or their
ancestors developed these abilities (Berna et al., 2012; Roebroeks
and Villa, 2011a, 2011b; Sandgathe et al., 2011a, 2011b;
Wrangham, 2009). Use of ﬁre must have conferred distinct advantages on early hominins, but unfortunately for archaeologists, it
is notoriously difﬁcult to identify in the archaeological record.
Furthermore, knowing, using and producing ﬁre may have been
successive stages in the evolution of humanity’s relationship with
ﬁre (Frazer, 1930); even nowadays, with all humans using ﬁre, not
all necessarily know how to produce it (Hill et al., 2011).
Some researchers believe controlled use of ﬁre to be a very early
phenomenon. Richard Wrangham (Wrangham, 2009; Wrangham
and Carmody, 2010) cites biological and morphological aspects of
human evolution as evidence that ﬁre has been an integrated part
of human behaviour for the last two million years. However, the
physical evidence for ﬁre use in the form of hearth locations is at
best very sporadic in the archaeological record of early Homo

(Bellomo, 1994; Berna et al., 2012; Brain and Sillen, 1988; Gowlett
and Wrangham, 2013; Gowlett et al., 1981; James, 1989). Europe,
occupied before one million years ago, has no clear traces of
habitual ﬁre use until 300e400,000 years ago (Roebroeks and Villa,
2011a). This implies hominins inhabited Europe hundreds of
thousands of years before becoming intentional ﬁre users in the
Middle Palaeolithic (MP) period. For the MP, there are good data for
habitual use of ﬁre (Roebroeks and Villa, 2011a), including use of
ﬁre as a tool, e.g. for cooking (Henry et al., 2011) and the production
of adhesives (Koller et al., 2001; Mazza et al., 2006). Based on these
data, Roebroeks and Villa (2011b) suggest that Neandertals probably had the ability to make ﬁre, and certainly the ability to
appropriate and transport it.
Sandgathe et al. (2011a, 2011b) state that while hominins may
have used ﬁre sporadically from about 300,000 years ago onward,
even late Neandertals did not know how to produce ﬁre, and only
used it during warmer intervals when higher frequencies of natural
ﬁres made it more readily available. If their hypothesis is correct,
ﬁre production would be a very late phenomenon restricted to the
archaeological record of modern humans at the end of the
Pleistocene.
Differentiating opportunistic, episodic use of ﬁre from the production of ﬁre in the archaeological record is a challenge. Currently,
there is little clear evidence of ﬁre production before the late Upper
Palaeolithic (UP), only indirect proxy data (i.e. charcoal, ash and

A. Sorensen et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 42 (2014) 476e486

heated ﬂint and bone) suggesting ﬁre use. This study attempts to
identify and describe direct artefactual evidence of ﬁre-starting in
the Palaeolithic. This is an important issue, as we archaeologists
have yet to ascertaindeven in coarse chronological termsdwhen
in our early prehistory ﬁre became a standard part of the human
tool kit.
2. Fire-starting tools, from the present to the past
Ethnographic data show two basic means by which ﬁre is produced by hunter-gatherers (Hough, 1926, 1928; Weiner, 2003). The
ﬁrst system employs wood-on-wood friction; the second utilises
stone-on-stone percussion or friction, generally using the combination of a ‘strike-a-light’ composed of ﬂint (or another siliceous
rock or mineral) and marcasite and/or pyrite, referred to hereafter
as “sulphuric iron” (after Weiner, 1997, 2003). Both methods have
been used historically with various types of tinder that ‘catch’ a
spark or coal and allow it to be more easily fanned to ﬂame (Hough,
1926, 1928). The fungus Fomes fomentarius is arguably the most
effective tinder (Weiner, 2003), but whether it was used for this
purpose in the Palaeolithic is not known. Reports of its presence at
the MP site Salzgitter-Lebenstedt (Germany) (Grahmann, 1956;
Oakley, 1961) have shown to be unsubstantiated (Johannes and
Schuh-Johannes, 1991), while Fomes ﬁnds at the late UP site of
Endingen (Germany) could not be related to human activities
(Terberger, 1996). Fomes was found with the c. 5300 year old ice
mummy Ötzi (Peintner et al., 1998), exhibiting trace amounts of
sulphuric iron powder (Sauter and Stachelberger, 1992).
It is possible that both the wood-on-wood and stone-on-stone
methods were independently invented and reinvented many
times. The chronological relationship of these methods is still
debated (Weiner, 2003) and difﬁcult to establish given the poor
preservation of wood. However, the relative durability of the stoneon-stone tool kit provides a more promising avenue of research.
Furthermore, the stone-on-stone method may also have had a
wider applicability, as it could have been a more reliable method for
generating sparks in cool-humid settings than the wood-on-wood
method. Testing by the authors has shown ﬂint and sulphuric iron
to produce sparks even while wet, unlike the wood-on-wood
technique (Hough, 1926). The stone-on-stone method, observed
historically throughout the world (Roussel, 2005), is the dominant
technique among groups living at higher latitudes in both North
and South America (e.g. Gusinde, 1931, 1937, 1974; Hough, 1928).
Regarding the archaeological visibility of the stone-on-stone
method, we made an inventory of possible strike-a-lights known
from the Palaeolithic record, yielding a small number only (Table 1).
The majority of these specimens were originally compiled by
Stapert and Johansen (1999; Johansen and Stapert, 2001). Not all
were physically examined by these (or the present) authors, but
were interpreted as potential strike-a-lights based on descriptions
in the literature of heavy edge-rounding and (if present) photos of
use traces, as this tool type is rarely incorporated into Palaeolithic
researchers’ typological lists (Patte, 1960). The geographical clustering of the strike-a-lights in the northwest corner of Europe and
Great Britain is likely an artefact of sampling bias based on these
researchers’ region of interest. A lone MP artefact exhibiting
possible traces of use as a strike-a-lightda Mousterian point from
Bettencourt (France), level N2b (MIS 5a)dis hinted at by Rots (2011,
Table 2 “Briquet”), but is not discussed in the text, nor are any
photos included. More information on this piece will be available in
the near future (Rots, in press).
As for sulphuric iron fragments, even fewer have been recovered
(Table 2). Most in this list were originally compiled by Weiner and
Floss (2004), followed by Roussel (2005). Nearly half are from MP
deposits; however, specimens exhibiting obvious signs of use have

477

only been recovered from UP contexts. Of particular interest is the
(now lost) La Cotte à la Chèvre (Jersey, United Kingdom) nodule
(Sinel, 1912, 1914), recovered in association with a MP hearth
feature, and of which Sinel said it “no doubt had been used in
conjunction with a ﬂint for striking ﬁre, for similar nodules have
been found under similar conditions in other caves” (1912, p. 210).
Unfortunately, Sinel failed to provide any further speciﬁcs on this
matter. Also noteworthy is the Drachenloch Cave (Switzerland)
nodule, its association to MP deposits tenuous due to conﬂicting
site reports (Bächler, 1940, 1947) and radiocarbon dates from the
associated hearth (Leuzinger-Piccard, 2003), and its state of use
confounded by modern traces made by the original excavator
‘testing’ the nodule with a piece of ﬂint (Bächler, 1940; Weiner and
Floss, 2004).
3. The expedient strike-a-light model
To determine what the earliest ﬁre-starting tools might have
looked like, we propose three hypotheses based on the apparent ad
hoc nature of many Palaeolithic technologies: 1) Any ﬂake, tool or
other ﬂint fragment suitable to the task of making ﬁredwhether
speciﬁcally produced for this task or notdmay have been used as a
strike-a-light, likely for only one ﬁre-making episode, before being
discarded or reused for another task. 2) Subsequent reuse or
resharpening of tools may have removed or obscured the evidence
of their use as strike-a-lights. 3) While strike-a-lights may have
been expedient in nature, fragments of sulphuric iron were likely
curated given their relative rarity.
The commonality of ad hoc tool use by humans has been
demonstrated repeatedly for both earlier hominins (Dibble, 1984,
1987; Dibble and Rolland, 1992; Roebroeks et al., 1997) and more
recent prehistoric and historic hunter-gatherer groups (Binford,
1973, 1979; Frison, 1968), including the expedient use of blades
and other ﬂint tools as strike-a-lights in late UP contexts (Johansen
and Stapert, 2001). There is rarely anything formal or standardised
about the pieces of ﬂint selected to function as strike-a-lights
(Gechter-Jones and Pawlik, 1998; van Gijn et al., 2006). The
strike-a-light as a tool type is deﬁned almost exclusively by its
distinctive wear pattern, not its morphology (Honegger, 2001).
Artefacts utilised as strike-a-lights in archaeological and ethnographical contexts include ﬂakes, blades, core fragments, unifacial
and bifacial forms, and stream gravels (Hough, 1926; Jeffreys, 1955;
Stapert and Johansen, 1999; van Gijn, 2010; van Gijn et al., 2006).
Moreover, it has been shown that individual tools in MP contexts
underwent numerous changes in form and function before being
discarded (Dibble, 1984, 1987; Turq et al., 2013). Assuming a tool
was used at some point to make a ﬁredunless performed near the
end of its use-life, as seen in some ‘recycled’ Neolithic tools having
been used as strike-a-lights (Honegger, 2001)devidence of this
task could be difﬁcult to discern after subsequent use, or absent
completely due to resharpening events.
The most well-known and recognisable prehistoric strike-alight specimens are described from Bronze Age and Neolithic
sites (Stapert and Johansen, 1999; van Gijn, 2010; van Gijn and
Niekus, 2001; van Gijn et al., 2006), many likely to have been
‘curated’ examples that exhibit very distinctive rounded and/or
faceted edges indicative of repetitive use. Most of the probable UP
strike-a-lights listed in Table 1 exhibit only moderate wear, though
generally visible with the naked eye (Stapert and Johansen, 1999). It
is difﬁcult to know whether these strike-a-lights were used to
kindle one or multiple ﬁres. Most modern experiments have
focused on recreating moderate to more heavily used specimens,
often using experimental pieces for 5e30 min. This is roughly 350
to 2100 strokes, assuming a rate of ca. 70 strokes a minute
(Johansen and Stapert, 1996). Yet, demonstrations by survivalists

using ﬂint, sulphuric iron and natural tinder have shown time and
again that a spark can be captured in fewer than 100 strokes, with
some instances requiring less than ten strokes (as demonstrated to
us by Jürgen Weiner, in 2011).
How might a strike-a-light used once for such a short period of
time appear in the archaeological record? Could this possibly account for the scarcity of later UP strike-a-lights, and the virtual
absence of such tools in the MP and early UP? The hypothesised
early hominin ‘use-and-lose’ mentality towards strike-a-lights and
the subsequent failure of researchers to recognise these tools as
such due to less evident microwear traces could account for their
invisibility in the MP archaeological record, and possibly earlier.
4. The experiments
The experimental assemblage is comprised of 18 ﬂint tools used
for short periods of time: 13 unmodiﬁed ﬂakes, one natural waterworn nodule fragment, two unifacially ﬂaked tools and two bifacially ﬂaked tools (Inline Supplementary Table S1). Extant strike-alights from the experimental comparative collection at the Leiden
University Laboratory for Artefact Studies (n ¼ 29) were also analysed for this study, but are not formally described here (Inline
Supplementary Table S2). The experimental assemblage was produced using a basalt hammerstone, with striking platforms prepared via light edge-grinding.
Inline Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 can be found online at
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2013.11.032.
The raw material used was a single cobble of ﬁne-grained
Cretaceous ﬂint, dark brown to dark grey in colour with common
slightly coarser-grained light grey mottles, recovered from a beach
near Happisburgh, Norfolk, England. The experimental strike-alights were forcibly applied against a single sulphuric iron nodule
eroded from Cretaceous chalk cliffs overlooking the beach near Cap

Gris-Nez, northwest France. Because of the presence of an oxidised
mineral cortex (likely goethite), the nodule was broken open to
expose fresh surfaces prior to experimentation.
The primary surface selected for use on the ﬂake tools was the
dorsal edge of the striking platform. The generally greater thickness
and higher angle of this edge compared to lateral and ventral ﬂake
edges make for an often sturdier working surface that is more
resistant to damage.
Two different methods of applying the ﬂint strike-a-light to the
sulphuric iron contact material were employed in this study: the
percussion (striking) method, and the friction (scraping) method.
To account for potential variation in use traces caused by differences in technique, some experimental pieces were held so the
working edge was brought across the contact-surface transversely
to the edge, while others were applied longitudinally (Fig. 1). In
reality, the exact motion exerted by any particular tool is dependent
on a host of factors, including the morphology and quality of both
the strike-a-light and the sulphuric iron, as well as by cultural or
personal preference, leading to a large number of potential application options.
Equally as difﬁcult to determine is the average length of time
needed by Palaeolithic people to kindle a ﬁre. A spark can be
captured by good tinder in fewer than ten strokes, but can often
take hundreds of strokes, depending on user proﬁciency, tinder
quality, and other factors affecting the effectiveness of a strike-alight (e.g. raw material quality and humidity). Assuming Palaeolithic people were generally proﬁcient at ﬁre-making, the total
number of strokes per ‘ﬁre-making event’ was arbitrarily set at 25
strokes for our experiments.
To document how the working edge of a strike-a-light evolves
over time during the early stages of its use, experimental pieces
were subjected to 25, 50, 75, or 100 total strokes performed in 25
stroke intervals; not all experiments completed all four series

percussion (striking) or friction (scraping). Experiments employing the friction method were initially pressed against the surface of the sulphuric iron nodule and then brought
down abruptly while applying pressure.

(Inline Supplementary Table S1). The number of strokes per series
that generated sparks was noted (Inline Supplementary Table S3).
The ﬂaked tool experiments underwent a further step, in which a
small section of the utilised edge was retouched to assess the
preservation potential of the microwear on both the tool and the
removed ﬂakes after resharpening. Before each series, photos were
taken at both macroscopic and microscopic scales, and casts were
made of the working edge using dental moulding gel (vinyl
polysiloxane).
After each series, the specimen was cleaned using soap and
running water to remove excess sulphuric iron residue adhering to
the working edge. It was found excess residue tended to impede the
setting process of the moulding gel, thus ruining the casts. Each
experiment was video recorded. The tool was weighed before and
after use to account for edge-loss (Inline Supplementary Table S3).
Any resultant edge-removals were collected after each series using
a dropcloth. Both the experimental ﬂint tools and the sulphuric iron

contact material were analysed for the presence of use traces. The
instruments used for analysis include a Nikon SMZ2T binocular
microscope (10e60 magniﬁcation), a Nikon Optiphot-1 metallographic microscope (50xe400), and a Leica DM6000-M
metallographic microscope (50e1000).

5. Experimental results
5.1. The strike-a-lights
Comparable to results attained in previous studies (Collin et al.,
1991; Johansen and Stapert, 1996; Stapert and Johansen, 1999; van
Gijn et al., 2006), the forcible application of ﬂint against sulphuric
iron yielded a regular suite of macroscopic and microscopic traces,
forming a distinctive pattern of microwear on the ﬂint. These traces

482

A. Sorensen et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 42 (2014) 476e486

included edge-rounding, edge-removal, crushing, striations, and
polish, and were all present on the experimental pieces (Fig. 2).
When assessing archaeological specimens, the degree of rounding
and the presence of stacked step fractures (i.e. crushing) are the
most important initial macroscopic identiﬁers of a potential strikea-light, while the presence and character of the striations are the
most indicative microscopic traces.
Microscopic traces varied little between experimental pieces (cf.
Collin et al., 1991). Striations almost invariably appeared as densely
packed clusters of parallel to sub-parallel linear traces within
discrete zones of matte, rough polish (Fig. 2a, def). The depth at
which these striations incised into the surface of the polish tended
to be greater than striations observed within polish produced by
softer materials like wood, hide, siliceous plants, or even soft stone.
Variability between experiments was primarily restricted to the
preservation (i.e. distribution) of traces. This is dictated by the
different ‘edge-stabilisation’ processes inherent in the friction and
percussion application methods, whereby the working surface
becomes more rounded (i.e. homogeneous) as protrusions are
removed. The friction method had a largely abrasive effect on an
edge, wearing away the surface relatively quickly and resulting in
an overall smoother and rounded appearance (Fig. 2b) with more
prevalent and continuous zones of microscopic traces than on tools
having utilised the percussion method (cf. Collin et al., 1991).
Whether the strike-a-light was applied in a transverse or longitudinal direction to the working edge had little bearing on the formation or preservation of these traces after the initial stabilisation
phase. Sub-circular pits (i.e. ‘micro-potlids’) were observed occasionally within zones of polish, presumably caused by frictionderived heat (Johansen and Stapert, 1996) (Fig. 2d). This unique
type of removal was observed almost exclusively on pieces
employing the friction method.
The percussion method, in contrast, appeared to homogenise a
surface via successive crushing of high spots, resulting in the
removal of numerous small angular-blocky fragments, occasional
micro-ﬂakes, and some larger ﬂakes. Crushing appeared as densely
stacked step fractures, with the small, newly created edges adding a
degree of ‘grip’ that seemed to aid in spark production (Fig. 2c). This
phenomenon was particularly prevalent on naturally rounded
surfaces (Inline Supplementary Table S1, Experiment 2006). However, when excessive surface loss was caused by crushing, zones of
polish and striations were generally restricted to isolated high
points and/or along the peripheries of the utilised area.
Small, clustered edge-removals were ubiquitous on the experimental pieces and, depending on the degree of use, were generally
present for the entire length of the effective working edge. Unifacially worked edges were more susceptible to edge-loss than
bifacial edges, especially when applied using a transverse motion.
Following the basic principles of ﬂintknapping, this can be attributed to edge-removals tending to follow ridges between extant
ﬂake scars along the direction of force. In general, edge damage
tended to be more extensive using the transverse technique for
both the percussion and friction method.
The characteristic microwear traces discussed above were also
observed on the majority of both incidental edge-removals and
purposefully detached resharpening ﬂakes. These traces were often
hardly noticeable macroscopically, but invariably occurred on the
dorsal side of the removal at or near the proximal end. This phenomenon appeared on even the smallest of chips, some less than
5 mm (Fig. 2d, e).
5.2. The sulphuric iron contact material
Though not the primary aim of this study, we analysed the
interior and exterior surfaces of the sulphuric iron nodule used as

the contact material for our strike-a-light experiments to discern
and describe any traces that could help identify utilisation on
archaeological specimens.
Prolonged use of the interior surfaces of the sulphuric iron
nodule resulted in the development of distinct, well-developed
traces (Inline Supplementary Fig. S1). The friction method often
produced shallow, sub-parallel and intersecting linear grooves
cross-cutting the radial crystal pattern of the nodule. After prolonged use, the surface became mostly ﬂat and homogeneous,
obscuring much of the original radial crystal pattern. Continued
usedespecially with the percussion methoddcreated a shallow
depression (cf. Beugnier and Pétrequin, 1997). Being prone to
chemical decomposition, the fresh surfaces rapidly oxidised, often
obscuring ﬁner striations (though this is not always the case
archaeologically, see Pawlik, 2004). However, an area of iron oxide
cortex at the edge of the nodule fragment was also scratched, and
this area better retained use traces due to its more chemically stable
state (Inline Supplementary Fig. S2).
Inline Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2 can be found online at
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2013.11.032.
The initial forcible opening of the nodule created three lensshaped primary impact scars following an extant fracture on the
exterior surface, along which the nodule ultimately parted. Exactly
opposite these primary impact scars were two secondary impact
scars and one zone of scufﬁng from contact with the anvil stone.
These two impact scars possessed a very similar spacing and
morphology to the primary impact scars (Inline Supplementary
Fig. S3). While these features may not be directly associated with
ﬁre-making, they could imply anthropogenic opening of a nodule
for that purpose on archaeological specimens where ﬁner traces are
no longer present.

doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2013.11.032.
5.3. Strike-a-light effectiveness
Spark generation frequencies and degree of edge-stabilisation
(inferred from weight of edge-removals) per series were recorded
for each experimental tool (Inline Supplementary Table S3). However, given the small sample size and the variability therein, little
can be said of this data (statistically) other than strike-a-lights are
indeed capable of propagating sparks early on in their use lives
despite generally higher edge-attrition rates than on heavily used
pieces with more stable edges. The fact that these tools can indeed
produce sparks from the beginning of their use lives renders moot
the observations of previous experimenters that the ‘effectiveness’
of a strike-a-light increases with use (Collin et al., 1991), given the
inferred short-term nature of expedient strike-a-light use. Based on
our experiments (and experiences), we would argue effectiveness
is dependent on user expertise, the morphology of the tool and the
gesture used, and over time reﬂects more the degree of edge stabilisation than an actual increase in spark production. More experiments focussing on strike-a-light effectiveness are needed to
provide the empirical data necessary to say more on this subject.
6. Identiﬁcation of strike-a-light wear
Experiments show that even very short-term usage of a strike-alight can produce abundant and readily identiﬁable microscopic
wear traces (Fig. 2). In fact, these traces appeared on salient portions of a tool edge even after a single stroke, albeit minimally
(Fig. 2c). Macroscopically, however, it was sometimes difﬁcult to
discern the pre-utilised state from very brief usage as a strike-alight. Incipient rounding was visible with the aid of a stereomicroscope, and under high magniﬁcation (100), striations and

A. Sorensen et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 42 (2014) 476e486

polish were often readily apparent. Distinct traces have also been
observed on minute edge fragments (<5 mm) removed during use
or from subsequent retouch (Fig. 2d, e). This suggests that the
former presence of a strike-a-light on a site could potentially be
identiﬁed even when the tool itself is absent.
Previous experiments revealed tool faces (as opposed to edges)
to also be effective at driving sparks, a technique that could allow
for the utilisation of a tool as a strike-a-light without risking
potentially severe edge-damage. Therefore, when looking for
strike-a-light use traces, the entire surface of a tool should be
examined, not only the edges.
The relative hardness of sulphuric iron is 6e6.5 on the Mohs
scale of mineral hardness; this is only slightly softer than ﬂint,
which averages 7. This comparable hardness, coupled with its ﬁnegrained nature and crystalline structure, is responsible for the
distinctive microwear traces it imparts onto ﬂint. Other stony materials could potentially leave similar traces, but detailed microwear studies and experimentation, while not exhaustive, have
allowed researchers to distinguish between them (Astruc, 2002;
Johansen and Stapert, 1996). Despite light edge-grinding incurred
during the knapping process, analysis of unused edges on experimental tools in this study showed few traces were left by the softer
basalt hammerstone.
Sulphuric iron residue was present on the working surfaces of
all the experimental pieces. Observed residue was randomly
distributed within, and/or on the peripheries of, zones of polish,
though it may be noted that residue appeared to be more prevalent
on high points than in recesses. However, despite the presence of
sulphuric iron residue on some Neolithic and Bronze Age strike-alights (Pawlik, 2004), and having been potentially observed on late
UP specimens (Stapert and Johansen, 1999), the probability of such
residue being preserved on archaeological pieces recovered from
most Palaeolithic deposits is low due to the susceptibility of the
mineral to chemical decomposition. Similarly, shiny prehensile
‘gloss’ caused by extensive handling and the presence of ﬁne sulphuric iron powder generated during use (Rots, 2012), a characteristic feature of later curated specimens (Beugnier and Pétrequin,
1997; van Gijn and Niekus, 2001), may not be found on expedient
Palaeolithic examples.
Identifying strike-a-lights in the archaeological record is a
difﬁcult task for a number of reasons. A strike-a-light is an
ephemeral tool that may have only been needed once at a site to
start a ﬁre, if at all. Assuming ﬁre was not transported to a site
from another location, as documented ethnographically for a
wide range of hunter-gatherers, e.g. in Tasmania (Roth, 1899;
Völger, 1972) and Tierra del Fuego (Gusinde, 1931, 1937, 1974;
Roebroeks and Villa, 2011a), a new ﬁre needs only to be lit
once and then maintained until the camp is broken. Considering
ﬁre is often kindled at or very near the hearth location, the
chances of incidental thermal alteration of a discarded strike-alight is considerable. Fortunately, direct exposure to ﬁre will
not necessarily adversely affect well-developed traces of use, as
evidenced by the presence of very distinct rounding, striations
and polish on an extensively thermally altered Neolithic strike-alight (Fig. 2f) from the Dutch site of Zeewijk (García-Díaz, in
preparation). Nevertheless, various other taphonomic factors,
including mechanical and chemical post-depositional processes,
can potentially obscure or obliterate microwear, as can subsequent reuse of a working edge.
7. Archaeological test cases
We analysed a limited number of MP lithic assemblages to test
for evidence of strike-a-light use. We performed cursory examinations of ﬂint specimens with a binocular microscope to identify

483

‘artefacts of interest’ with ‘suspect’ surfaces exhibiting slight
rounding or crushing. These pieces were then examined with an
incident-light microscope to identify use traces comparable to
known experimental and archaeological microwear features of
strike-a-lights. To date, approximately 21,500 lithic artefacts have
been analysed from sites ranging in age from as early as MIS 8 to
MIS 3, including the Last Interglacial site Neumark-Nord 2 (n ¼ c.
8700) in Germany (Sier et al., 2011), the late Middle Pleistocene
deposits at La Cotte à la Chèvre (n ¼ c. 8000) on Jersey (Channel
Islands, UK) (Callow, 1986; McBurney, 1963; Sinel, 1912, 1914),
Scaldina Cave (from Layers 1A and 5, dating to MIS 3 and a cold
phase of the Weichselian Early Glacial, respectively) in Belgium
(n ¼ 4351) (Bonjean et al., 2011; Pirson et al., 2008), the MIS 5b-5c
open-air site Remicourt (n ¼ 376) also in Belgium (Bosquet et al.,
2004), and a small collection of exogenous ﬂints (n ¼ 96) from
inﬁll deposits in late Middle Pleistocene volcanos in the Eifel region
of western Germany, at Plaidter Hummerich, Herchenberg,
Schweinskopf-Karmelenberg, Kunkskopf, Eiterköpfe, Nickenicher
Sattel, In den Wannen and Tönchesberg. These ﬂints were imported
as early as the late Saalian (MIS 6), though mainly during the Early
Weichselian (MIS 5), from ﬂint sources more than 100 km away
(Floss, 1994).
The Neumark-Nord 2 assemblage was sampled from the large
amount of material excavated there, with some fragments alluding
to the presence of ﬁre (including heated ﬂints, charred bones and
charcoal), though no formal hearth locations were observed. La
Cotte à la Chèvre was selected due to the contextual association of a
sulphuric iron nodule (Table 2) and a MP hearth (Sinel, 1912, 1914).
Unfortunately, only a small fraction of the assemblage from the
initial excavations by Sinel remain in the current collection, the
remainder being from 1960s excavations of remnant and disturbed
deposits (Callow, 1986; McBurney, 1963). Possible heavy trampling
coupled with poor curation of the lithic materials from la Chèvre
has led to poor preservation of microwear traces. At Scladina Cave,
the recovery from layer 1A (and only this layer in the whole cave
sequence) of two small geothite after marcasite/pyrite fragments
(Table 2)dpossibly derived from a sulphuric iron nodule cortexdalong with the presence of burned bone (Bonjean et al., 2011),
provided the impetus to examine the ﬂint artefacts from this site.
Unfortunately, much like the lithics from la Chèvre, the artefacts
were heavily patinated precluding identiﬁcation of use traces. The
artefacts from Remicourt were very well preserved, however, some
constituent pieces of glued reﬁtting sequences could not be analysed in the short amount of time available. The small Eifel ﬂint
assemblage was examined to explore the hypothesis that these
exotic pieces may have been transported to this ﬂint-sparse area of
Germany for the purpose of ﬁre-making en route. However, the
abundance of both quartz and quartzite in the associated assemblages made it unlikely that these ﬁner, more easily worked ﬂint
pieces were used for such a potentially destructive task, though
exhausted tools of good quality raw material are known to have
been preferentially selected for reuse as strike-a-lights at some
later Neolithic sites (Honegger, 2001).
Of the large number of artefacts evaluated using the binocular
microscope, only a fraction (w1.2%) were subjected to further
analysis with a high-powered microscope. While a number of these
artefacts exhibited macroscopically observable edge-rounding or
crushing, microscopic evidence consistent with likely use as a
strike-a-light was not observed. It should be stressed that strike-alights do not frequently occur even in later assemblages, so their
absence in those analysed for this study is perhaps not surprising,
especially given some of the less-than-ideal circumstances
mentioned for each site (e.g. no hearth structures, deposition in
coarse-grained and/or geologically dynamic sediments resulting in
poor artefact preservation, or small sample size). Unfortunately, the

484

A. Sorensen et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 42 (2014) 476e486

question as to whether or not these results reﬂect an actual absence
of strike-a-light use remains open.
8. Conclusions and recommendations
The use of expedient strike-a-light methods by late UP huntergatherers is supported by experimental and archaeological data
(Stapert and Johansen, 1999; Johansen and Stapert, 2001), but has
only been observed in the north of Europe. Neandertals lived,
survived, and thrived in these colder northern latitudes far longer
than modern humans, making them the likely progenitors of artiﬁcially kindled ﬁre (Roebroeks and Villa, 2011a). Yet to date, only
one tool possessing the requisite attributes to be considered as
having been expediently used as a strike-a-light is known to have
been recovered from a MP context (Rots, 2011, in press). This one
ﬁnd can hardly be considered a trend, however, which some researchers might take as a sign that Neandertals were on the whole
incapable of producing ﬁre (Sandgathe et al., 2011a, 2011b).
Conversely, few researchers would infer that modern humans were
incapable of making ﬁre at will during the UP despite the fact
thatdat the momentdstrike-a-lights appear to be just as lacking
from the ﬁrst three-quarters of this period as they are from the MP.
However, the literature does allude to examples of Aurignacian
tools with comparable microwear traces (Symens, 1988), or those
vaguely described as possessing conspicuously rounded ends, but
whose functions have yet to be assessed using modern analytical
methods (e.g. Patte, 1937, not included in Table 1). Has enough work
been done to identify early strike-a-lights to properly assess their
prevalence in the archaeological record? Could this virtual absence
be due to the fact that neither Neandertals nor early modern
humans possessed this technology, save for a few very localised
‘chance’ innovations? Or was wood-on-wood friction perhaps the
preferred method for producing ﬁre, the equipment itself having
either been burned or rotted away?

We have proposed an alternative scenario with the expedient
strike-a-light model: the invisibility of ﬁre production in the
Palaeolithic record is an artefact of the ephemeral nature of this
tool type in hunter-gatherer societies. The identiﬁcation of the
Bettencourt piece as a possible strike-a-light lends credibility to
the idea that Neandertals were capable of making ﬁre (Rots, 2011,
2013). Furthermore, sulphuric iron nodules in Palaeolithic contexts can act as possible ﬁre production proxies. This is most true
for the UP Laussel and Trou de Chaleux nodules (Fig. 3) that
exhibit obvious traces of use as ﬁre-making equipment. The fact
that these typically more readily weathered pieces exist while
deﬁnitive examples of their more durable ﬂint strike-a-light
counterparts are lacking is the best indication that informal ﬂint
implements used as strike-a-lights are likely present but not
readily recognised, having instead been ‘lost in the crowd’ among
large collections of lithic artefacts.
Misidentiﬁcation of macroscopic traces could be one cause of
this. Edge-rounding or crushing on ﬂakesdspeciﬁcally on the
dorsal edge of the proximal enddis typically attributed to edgegrinding for the purpose of preparing a striking platform. In terms
of ﬁre-making, however, this edge is important for two reasons: 1)
for larger ﬂakes, it is often the most robust edge on a ﬂake, making
it ideal for use as a readymade strike-a-light; and 2) for smaller
chips and ﬂakes, it is potentially the former working edge of a tool
on which wear traces may still be preserved, as experiments have
shown. Furthermore, the continuation of edge-rounding or
crushing onto the ventral side of the striking platform is also a
clear indication of possible use as a strike-a-light, as this cannot
happen purely from platform preparation.
Analysts should be aware of the tell-tale macroscopic traces of
strike-a-light use, speciﬁcally crushing (stacked step fractures) and/
or surface rounding that contrast with ‘sharp’ edge-terminations
found on unmodiﬁed specimens (Fig. 2a, b). If encountered while
cataloguing a collection or conducting lithic analyses, these suspect
pieces should be set aside for analysis by a microwear specialist.
Deeply incised and densely clustered (sub)parallel striations in
zones of matte polish are the most obvious microscopic signs of use
as a strike-a-light (Fig. 2cef).
Artefacts exhibiting these traces can be used to infer the presence of ﬁre-making on sites where direct evidence of burning is
lacking due to taphonomic variables. When actively seeking evidence of ﬁre production in a large collection, focus should be placed
on artefacts recovered at or near hearth locations, includingdif
possibledsmall edge-removals recovered by sieving. Only through
the systematic analysis of a larger sample of artefacts from wellpreserved (i.e. open-air sites in loessic depositional settings) and
well-excavated sites exhibiting strong evidence for controlled use
of ﬁre will it be possible to determine if and when pre-modern
human hunter-gatherers utilised stone-on-stone ﬁre production
on a regular basis.
