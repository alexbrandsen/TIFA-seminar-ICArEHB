Bones submitted to heat experience structural and chromatic modiﬁcations. In particular, heat-induced
bone warping and thumbnail fractures have been linked to the burning of ﬂeshed and green bones e
where the soft tissues have been removed from the bones soon after death e in contrast to dry bones.
Those have been suggested as indicators of the state of the individual before being burned thus allowing
inferences about the funerary behaviour of archaeological populations. A large sample of 61 skeletons
submitted to cremation has been examined for the presence of both of these heat-induced features.
Although uncommon, bone warping and thumbnail fractures were present in some of the skeletons
demonstrating that its presence is not restricted to the burning of non-dried bones as generally believed.
Rather than being an indicator of the presence of bones with soft tissues, bone warping seems to be more
of an indicator of the preservation of collageneapatite links which can be maintained on dry bones with
low collagen deterioration. In addition, our results also do not conﬁrm thumbnail fractures as an
exclusive sign of the burning of bones with soft tissues. As a result, these heat-induced changes should be
used with caution when trying to infer about the pre-burning state of an individual.

1. Introduction
Bone modiﬁcations caused by exposure to heat interfere with
anthropological analysis and so it is critical to understand how and
to what extent they occur. With this in mind, several researchers
carried out experimentations designed to document bone changes
and ﬁnd trends regarding heat-induced fracture patterns, bone
warping, shrinkage and colouration (Baby, 1954; Binford, 1963;
Shipman et al., 1984; Buikstra and Swegle, 1989; Spennemann
and Colley, 1989; Etxeberria, 1994; Mays, 1998; Whyte, 2001). As
a result of these efforts, researchers are able to infer relevant
conclusions concerning funerary behaviour that would be difﬁcult
to achieve otherwise. For instance, despite some variations,
researchers have demonstrated an approximately direct correlation
between burning temperature and subsequent bone colour thus
allowing us to roughly estimate the minimum temperature at

which a given corpse has been submitted (Shipman et al., 1984;
Mays, 1998; Walker and Miller, 2005; Munro et al., 2007). In
addition, previous work suggests that bone warping and fracture
patterns are indicative of the condition of the individual before
burning thus informing us if the individual was cremated right after
death or if the burning of the remains was only a secondary process.
All this information contributes for the description of the circumstances surrounding death and helps to interpret funerary behaviour of a particular chrono-cultural environment. However,
although research regarding heat-induced colour changes in bone
has been more proliﬁc and found some correlation between colour
and temperature, the experimentation on the subject of bone
warping and fracture patterns is more sparse and uncertain (Baby,
1954; Binford, 1963; Buikstra and Swegle, 1989; Spennemann and
Colley, 1989; Etxeberria, 1994; Whyte, 2001). Although some
researchers pointed out the absence of bone warping on cremated
dry bone (Baby, 1954; Binford, 1963; Etxeberria, 1994), others have
achieved contrasting results (Buikstra and Swegle, 1989;
Spennemann and Colley, 1989; Whyte, 2001). Also, thumbnail
fractures e curved transverse fractures e have not been observed
on experimental cremation of dry bone (Binford, 1963; Buikstra and
Swegle, 1989). However, all previous experimental research has
either been carried out on small samples or has included only

animal bones. Therefore, the analysis of larger samples of human
skeletons may bring new and important light into this topic.
The aim of the present paper is to establish if heat-induced bone
warping and thumbnail fracturing can occur on cremated dry
bones. As part of a current PhD research, permission from
a crematorium was obtained for the pre- and post-cremation
analysis of 61 skeletons which had been previously inhumated for
a minimum of ﬁve years until complete removal of soft tissues. The
results presented here derive from the largest sample of burned
known modern human skeletons analysed to date and therefore
contribute for the better understanding of heat-induced bone
changes and consequent interpretation of burning-related
circumstances of archaeological contexts.

2. Material and methods
The sample is composed of 61 Portuguese adult skeletons
partially identiﬁed according to sex and age. It includes 28 females
and 33 males. From these, 25 individuals had ages-at-death
between 23 and 99 years-old. The mean age for the sex-pooled
sample was of 68 years-old while the mean ages for both females
and males were of 74 (n ¼ 14) and 61 (n ¼ 11) years-old respectively. We do not know the exact age for the remaining 36 individuals because the date of birth was not registered on the
cemetery records, but all were adults. The sample is mainly
composed of skeletons unclaimed by their relatives from a civil
cemetery which have been selected for cremation in order to free
some cemeterial space. The process of cremation was followed by
one of the authors (DG). The skeletons had no soft tissues at the
point of exhumation. They were processed at a modern crematorium after being inhumated for at least 5 years. Cremations lasted
between 15 and 45 min and achieved temperatures ranging from
450 to 890  C (mean ¼ 780.28  C). After cremation and before
cremulation, all skeletons were visually examined for warping in
bone structure especially looking for unusual bending of the
diaphysis and for heat-fractured ends on every bone. An example of
a warped long bone is shown in Fig. 1. The examination also
included the search for thumbnail fractures on the diaphysis of the
long bones as seen in Fig. 2. Only these two variables were under
study and no other heat-induced features have been scored.

3. Results
Almost complete calcination was observed on 19 individuals,
while the remaining 42 skeletons displayed a more mixed set of
carbonized and calcined bones. Bone warping was found on 4 out of
the 61 burned skeletons which constitute 6.5% of all analysed
individuals. This occurrence was documented for the long bones of
4 males (Figs. 3 and 4). These long bones comprised a tibia, a radius,
a humerus and an unidentiﬁed diaphysis. No warping was found in
any of the 28 females examined. The cremation details for the 4
cases are provided in Table 1. From these, the longest inhumation
period experienced by an individual prior to cremation was of 45
years and the shortest was of 7 years. The range of temperatures of
combustion ranged between 450 and 890  C. Only one of the four
skeletons exhibited almost complete calcination. The remaining
three displayed both pre-calcined and calcined shades.

Thumbnail fractures were found on the long bones of 5 out of
the 61 burned skeletons (Fig. 5) thus composing 8.2% of the sample
(Table 2). The temperatures for these 5 cremations ranged between
450 and 730  C with a duration between 15 and 40 min. Once
again, the longest inhumation period was of 45 years. Individual
267 exhibited thumbnail fractures on the endocortical surface of
a long bone. Skeleton 34 was almost completely calcined while the
other four were partly carbonized and partly calcined.

4. Discussion
Bone warping was only detected in males. These were cremated
at various temperatures for at least 15 min. Thumbnail fracturing
was observed for both females and males cremated at various
temperatures for at least 15 min. The period of inhumation before

the cremation process was diverse as well. We do not have sufﬁcient data for the age-at-death of the individuals exhibiting bone
warping to allow for any inference, but both younger and older
adults displayed thumbnail fractures after cremation. No statistical
analyses were carried out because of the small size of the subsample presenting both forms of heat-induced changes, but our
results indicate that its occurrence is not dependent on speciﬁc
duration of cremation, temperature of combustion, inhumation
period and age-at-death. In contrast, the sex of the individual may
be an important variable for the occurrence of heat-induced bone
warping because this feature was not found for the female sample.
This might be related to the larger density/mineralization of males
bones in relation to female ones. However, research on a larger
sample is needed to conﬁrm this result. Also, both features were
only detected for the diaphysis of long bones so their occurrence
may be at least more often linked to this kind of bone.
As to the recorded presence of bone warping, Baby (1954)
documented it on human ﬂeshed bones but did not ﬁnd it on

human dry bones after burning. The same conclusion was obtained
by Binford (1963) using a monkey cadaver and a human archaeological bone. Etxeberria (1994) experimented on a 10 cm femoral
fragment from an autopsied cadaver and another femoral fragment
of the same size from an individual dead for more than 15 years and
obtained the same results. In contrast, Whyte (2001) documented
heat-induced bone warping while experimenting with archaeological deer bone. Also, Spennemann and Colley (1989) reported
warping on an experimentally burned dry human humerus. Finally,
Buikstra and Swegle (1989) also found warping in human and dog
dry bones cremated in open-air oak ﬁres.
Our results demonstrate that, although the occurrence of bone
warping is rare, it is observable on dry bones submitted to heat. Our
documented cases were heated at temperatures of at least 450  C
and for a minimum of 15 min. The results reveal that heat-induced
warping is not exclusively linked to the burning of ﬂeshed and
green bones as suggested previously by other researchers (Buikstra
and Swegle, 1989; Spennemann and Colley, 1989; Whyte, 2001).
The explanation for the allegedly exclusive presence of heatinduced warping on ﬂeshed and green bones in contrast to dry
bones has been linked to the contraction of the muscle ﬁbres
(Binford, 1963). Alternatively, Spennemann and Colley (1989) link
distortion to the presence of excessive heat trapped on the bone
medullary cavity thus being able to occur in both ﬂeshed and dry
bones. Thompson (2005) argues that both statements are problematic because contracting muscles would hardly be capable to
cause bones to bend, and the very porous nature of bone would not
allow for the trapping of air in the medullary cavity. As an alternative, Thompson (2005) argues that the contractions of the periosteum or the anisotropy in the collagen distribution within the
bone cortex are better candidates to shoulder responsibility.
However, Thompson (2005) notes that there are no quantitative
data to substantiate any theory.
Bone matrix is composed of a mineral component which grants
it stiffness and a collagen component which contributes to bone
toughness and to its resilience to mechanical forces (Zioupos et al.,
1999; Viguet-Carrin et al., 2006). The decay of collagen in dry bones
diminishes bone elasticity preventing signiﬁcantly bending before
eventually fracturing in contrast to ﬂeshed and green bones. This
means that the presence of warping on our dry bones sample is
evidence of enough collagen enabling them with some elasticity.
Otherwise, bones would simply become more brittle and susceptible to fracture and not warp at all.
A bone submitted to heat will experience a transformation of
the crystalline collagen triple helical structure into an amorphous
random coil form, a process known as collagen shrinkage (Zioupos
et al., 1999). Collagen will contract if heated at a gradually
increasing temperature, but will develop a contractile force which
drags the mineral along if heated at a constant temperature
(Zioupos et al., 1999). In dry bones, collageneapatite bonds may
have been weakened so the mineral component will not be dragged
by the contractile mechanism of collagen (Bartsiokas, 2000). Both
collagen content and temperature are probably related to bone
warping but more research is needed to fully understand their role
on this particular heat-induced event. The presence of soft tissues is
probably not directly related to heat-induced bone warping and

constitutes merely an indicator of good collagen preservation. Most
likely, the latter enhances the possibility for the occurrence of bone
warping events.
If collagen content is indeed related to bone warping, then age is
a factor since collagen degradation begins during life (Collins et al.,
2002; Zioupos et al., 1999). Sex is a factor as well because postmenopausal women are usually more affected by osteoporosis
which causes architectural rearrangement of the bone tissue and
subsequent loss of skeletal strength (Brickley, 2002). This may
suggest that in older individuals, men are more likely to retain
sufﬁcient collagen to cause warping, and thus may explain why our
four documented cases of bone warping belong to males.
Another bone alteration systematically linked to the burning of
corpses with soft tissues regards the fracture pattern. The thumbnail fractures are pointed out in the literature as a distinctive
feature between ﬂeshed/green bones and dry bones although no
explanation for this differential occurrence has been provided.
These have been observed in previous experimental burnings
(Binford, 1963; Buikstra and Swegle, 1989) and its absence from dry
bones has led to the wide-spread conviction that thumbnail fractures are in fact an indicator of the cremation of bodies with soft
tissues (Binford, 1963; Guillon, 1987; Herrmann and Bennett, 1999;
Whyte, 2001). As a result, the interpretation of funerary behaviour
has often been supported by these beliefs (Bartsiokas, 2000;
Gonçalves, 2007; Ubelaker and Rife, 2007; Curtin, 2008; Duncan
et al., 2008). However, although experimental research so far supported this assumption, the quantitative data available here did not
allow for such reliable distinctions to be made.
Our analysis conﬁrmed the presence of thumbnail fractures
after the burning of dry human bones. The bones exhibiting this
heat-induced change were submitted to temperatures of at least
450  C with combustion lasting for at least 15 min. As with bone
warping, heat-induced thumbnail fractures were infrequently
observed on our sample of dry bones but the results demonstrate
that it cannot be considered an exclusive occurrence of ﬂeshed and
green bone cremations. Therefore, the present research does not
corroborate previous results pointing to thumbnail fractures as an
indicator of cremated non-dry bones (Binford, 1963; Buikstra and
Swegle, 1989). Similarly to bone warping, thumbnail fractures
could be related to collagen as well but we do not have data to
support this allegation. As a result, the state of the skeleton prior to
cremation is not necessarily directly related to the emergence of
thumbnail fractures, although previous research leads us to state
that it is more frequent for burned ﬂeshed/green bones than for dry
bones.
The limitations of our study are related to the lack of controlled
laboratorial conditions. The combustion protocol followed by the
crematorium adapts itself to each speciﬁc cremation. It depends on
numerous factors such as resilience to ﬁre of the skeletal remains,
use or dispense from using a wooden container and the pre-heated
condition of the furnace. Here, the state of the combustion was
constantly checked by the technicians and the number of active
burners or the oxygen intake is set according to the needs of each
cremation. Therefore, temperature and duration is not the same
for all cremations. This complicated the attempt to identify

combustion-related factors playing a part over the presence or
absence of heat-induced warping and thumbnail fracturing. As
a result, possible relations between these changes and speciﬁc heat
patterns should be taken with caution.
This is the largest human sample ever scrutinized for heatrelated bone changes of this type and this fact may explain why its
occurrence was not perceived on some of the previous studies.
Because of its rarity, the samples available for earlier analyses were
probably not large enough to allow for its detection. The 6.5% of
individuals displaying bone warping is probably an underestimation. Most likely, its actual occurrence is even more common but
fragmentation may have prevented us from detecting additional
cases in our sample.
In short, the results obtained by this research help deconstruct
some of the preconceived beliefs regarding the analysis of burned
bones. These beliefs resulted from experiments on small samples
which were unable to provide for a large enough perspective of the
heat-induced changes affecting human bone. In the past, these
have been used for the interpretation of the funerary behaviour of
palaeo-populations (Bartsiokas, 2000; Gonçalves, 2007; Ubelaker
and Rife, 2007; Curtin, 2008; Duncan et al., 2008). Fortunately
most researchers have been aware of the lack of signiﬁcant
experimental research regarding this topic and refrained from
pointing out these heat-induced changes as unequivocal indicators
for the burning of ﬂeshed and green bones. A review of all related
research reveals that warping and thumbnail fractures tend to
occur more frequently on ﬂeshed and green bones than on dry
bones. Instead of being the direct result of the presence of soft
tissues per se, these changes are probably related to loss of speciﬁc
mechanical properties in the bone such as those provided by
collagen. As a result, the interpretation of funerary behaviour based
on the attribution of bone warping and thumbnail fracturing events
to the cremation of ﬂeshed and green bones can be misleading and
must be made with caution.

5. Conclusions
The analysis of 61 modern skeletons burned at a modern
crematorium allowed to clarify this issue of bone warping and
thumbnail fracturing as events indicating the cremation of ﬂeshed
bones and green bones. These heat-induced changes were also
found on dry bones thus demonstrating that its occurrence is not
directly related to the presence of soft tissues and that interpretation of the state of the individual before its cremation should be
made with prudence.
Skeletal collagen content and the maintenance of the collageneapatite bonds guarantee the elasticity and toughness of bone,
so the loss of these mechanical properties probably impedes the
warping response of bone to heat. As for thumbnail fractures, an
explanation for its cause is more uncertain. However, the results
obtained in the present investigation suggest that the clariﬁcation
of the causes for these heat-induced changes must be achieved
microscopically rather than by using the macroscopic analysis used
in the present research.
