Roc de Marsal has yielded numerous remains of Mousterian occupations, including lithics, fauna and
combustion features. It was made famous by the discovery of the skeleton of a Neanderthal child. Given
the need to date the sequence, TL and OSL were applied on heated ﬂints and quartz, and OSL on unheated
quartz. Chronological results combined with palaeoenvironmental data e faunal remains and micromorphological features in the sediments from the cave, pollen proxies and faunal remains from the
region e allowed us to place climate variations in southwest France on a numerical time scale.
Denticulate Mousterian occupations were dated to the middle of MIS 4 (65e70 ka) and Quina layers
either to the very end of MIS 4 or to MIS 3. Interestingly, a faunal pattern showing a mix of red deer, roe
deer and reindeer was found to have occurred during MIS 4, which was shown to be consistent with data
from other similar sites in southwest France.

1. Introduction
During the Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5e3, Neanderthals had
to face dramatic changes in climatic and environmental
conditions, well documented in ice-core 18O variations and
marine-core pollen data, faunal remains from archaeological sites
and geological signatures in sedimentary deposits. Lithic production also varied during the period spanning MIS 5e3 as seen in

variations in the technology of blank production and in changes in
the emphasis of certain retouched tool categories. These variations
have led to the creation of the Mousterian techno-complexes
including Denticulate Mousterian, Typical Mousterian, Quina
Mousterian, and Mousterian of Acheulian tradition, among others.
Interplay between cultural and environmental changes has been at
the centre of many debates in archaeology, including how environmental changes might have triggered innovations in cultural
productions through demographic changes (e.g. Chase, 1986;
Henrich, 2004; Stiner et Kuhn, 2006; Richerson et al., 2009) and
how they impacted the selection of hunted prey by past hominins
(e.g. Grayson et al., 2001; Grayson and Delpech, 2002; Discamps
et al., 2011; Delagnes and Rendu, 2011). However, the scarcity of

3072

chronological data related to human occupations, essential for
robust correlations between independent environmental and
archaeological records, renders the interpretation of these variations difﬁcult, if not mainly limited to hypotheses.
The Roc de Marsal sequence is one of the richest Mousterian
sequences in southwest France and was made famous by the
discovery of the skeleton of a Neanderthal child (Bordes and Laﬁlle,
1962). This site documents changes in lithic production (Denticulate, Typical with a high Levallois index, and Quina Mousterian
techno-complexes) associated with important climatic changes, as
attested to by analyses of faunal remains and sedimentary deposits.
Thus far, in terms of chronology, only qualitative interpretations
relating fauna to MIS have been proposed e hence the need for
numerical chronological data. The aim of this paper is to a) combine
TL and OSL dating methods to determine a chronological scenario
for the successive occupations of the cave; and b) discuss this
scenario in the context of two different environmental proxies as
provided by faunal remains from the cave and independent
regional reconstructions based on palynological studies of marine
sediment cores. A comparison with other Mousterian sites showing
similarities in the region is also presented.
2. Presentation of the site
Roc de Marsal is a small cave located in southwest France
(Campagne, Dordogne). It is situated in a south-facing karstic cliff
approximately 80 m above a tributary valley of the Vézère River
(Fig. 1). Inﬁlling sediments, lying on top of karstic bedrock, have
yielded remains of human activity corresponding to Middle
Palaeolithic, Upper Palaeolithic and ﬁnally medieval periods. A roof
fall involving a number of massive calcareous blocks occurred at
some point, presumably during an intense cold period, separating
recent from Palaeolithic artefacts (Couchoud, 2003). This collapse
of the roof seems to have occurred during the Middle Palaeolithic,

since Mousterian artefacts have been found above the blocks. A
plan view of the site is shown in Fig. 2.
Excavations were carried out by an amateur, J. Laﬁlle, from 1953
until 1971 (Bordes and Laﬁlle, 1962). Later a new series of
campaigns were undertaken by some of the present authors,
between 2004 and 2009, to re-explore the stratigraphy of the site
and to re-assess the archaeological features of the Middle Palaeolithic occupations (Turq et al., 2008). A reappraisal of the stratigraphy led to the distinction of seven major lithostratigraphic units
and 13 archaeological layers, over a total thickness of between 1
and 2 m (Fig. 3). Excavations revealed a great number of ﬂint tools,
cores and ﬂakes, as well as bones from a number of species
including micro-fauna and large mammals. The site is particularly
rich in combustion features (Goldberg et al., 2012; Aldeias et al.,
2012), often found in a very good state of preservation. What has
made the Roc de Marsal cave most famous is the discovery of a subcomplete skeleton of Neanderthal child (Bordes and Laﬁlle, 1962;
Turq, 1989). The interpretation as a burial reﬂecting symbolism
among Neanderthals, is, however, still discussed (Sandgathe et al.,
2011a).
The nature of the sediments and micromorphological features
were studied by Couchoud (2003) and more recently by Golberg
(2007). Layers 13e10, which yielded almost no anthropic remains
e except for rubeﬁed lenses attesting to temporary human occupations (Couchoud, 2003) e are mainly composed of clayey silts
and altered bedrock. Layers 9e5 constitute one lithostratigraphic
unit made of interbedded ashy deposits and clayey silts and are
very rich in anthropic remains. The anthropic deposits contain
a number of combustion features, ﬂints and bones attesting to an
important contribution to the deposits. Layers 4 and 3 also show
a strong anthropic inﬂuence, but without combustion features;
they exhibit clayey silts, aeolian deposition and limestone blocks
from the cave walls and roof. Layer 2 is made of metric to plurimetric calcareous blocks corresponding to a massive collapse of

the roof. Ice segregation is particularly important in Layers 4e2,
attesting to particularly cold climate conditions during or after
deposition of these sediments (Couchoud, 2003; Golberg, 2007).
Lithic production has been attributed to: Denticulate Mousterian (Layers 9, 8 and 7) with a high Levallois index and an emphasis
on small ﬂake production similar to the so-called Asinipodian
(Bordes, 1975; Dibble and McPherron, 2006) at Pech de l’Azé IV;

Typical Mousterian (Layers 6 and 5) with a high percentage of
scrapers and Levallois blank production; Quina Mousterian (Layers
4, 3 and 2), based on the high percentage of scrapers, many of
which are transverse scrapers with a heavy, Quina-type, invasive
retouch. Layers 7 and 9 yielded numerous combustion features and
a high percentage of burnt lithics (Sandgathe et al., 2011b). Finally,
Layer 10 revealed very few lithics and faunal remains, whereas

Layers 11e13 contained no trace of human occupations e except for
a few small lenses of rubeﬁed sediments.
Zooarchaeological analyses point to a nearly exclusive human
accumulation of the macrofaunal remains, with an abundance of cut
marks and burnt bones coupled with a scarcity of traces of carnivore
activity (Castel et al., 2007, in Sandgathe et al., 2007). For Layers 9e5
the ungulate remains pattern is complex, since Rangifer tarandus
remains are found in association with abundant Cervus elaphus
(red deer) and Capreolus capreolus (roe deer) remains e taxa that
are generally indicative of more temperate conditions. In Layers 4,
3 and 2, ungulate remains potentially indicate a cold climate with
the predominance of R. tarandus (reindeer), as is often the case in
faunal assemblages associated with Quina industries (see
Discamps et al., 2011, for a regional study). This climatic change is
also perceptible in microfaunal analyses: Microtus arvalis (common
vole), Arvicola terrestris (water vole), Microtus gregalis (narrowheaded vole), Chionomys nivalis (snow vole), Microtus malei (similar
tundra vole) dominate Layers 4e2, whereas in the lower layers these
species are associated with Microtus agrestis (ﬁeld vole), Eliomys
quercinus (garden dormouse) and Microtus subterraneus (European
pine vole). The fact that both macrofaunal and microfaunal
analyses identify the same patterns strengthens the view that the
changes in the hunted prey can indeed be correlated with climate
changes and is not only due to deliberate changes in prey selection.
The combination of faunal analysis and micromorphological
studies at Roc de Marsal clearly indicate that the climate changed
during the deposition of sediments with a change from more
temperate climates at the base to colder conditions at the top of the
sequence. As a consequence, thus far it has been hypothesised that
the base of the sequence (Layers 9e5) corresponds to MIS 5, and the
top of the sequence (Layers 4e2) to MIS 4. Whereas ESR dating of
teeth is in progress (see Blackwell et al., 2007, in Sandgathe et al.,
2007, for preliminary results), this paper is meant to test this
hypothesis in the light of numerical chronology results, using TL
and OSL dating methods.
3. Luminescence dating: samples and methods
3.1. Sampling strategy and sample treatment
Given the importance of the archaeological record, it was
decided to carry out TL and OSL dating studies on different materials. TL has been extensively used for the dating of burnt stones
found in archaeological sites (e.g. Mercier et al., 1991, 1995a, 1995b,
2007a; Mercier and Valladas, 2003; Tribolo et al., 2009). OSL has
allowed indirect dating of human occupations by the dating of
sediment deposition (e.g. Jacobs et al., 2008; Jacobs, 2010). In some
sites the combination of both methods led to a detailed understanding of chronology (e.g. Mercier et al., 2003, 2007b). At Roc de
Marsal the use of ﬁre in the cave resulted in well-preserved
combustion features: for dating purposes heated sediments and
heated ﬂints are directly related to human activities; indirect dating
was undertaken by dating sediment deposition in the cave.
The ﬁrst sampling took place in 2003, prior to the new excavations. A portion of the site was speciﬁcally excavated for luminescence dating purposes: two heated ﬂints (samples Bdx 9072 and
9102) and three samples of heated sediments (Bdx 9054, 9090,
9092) were found and a detailed gamma radioactivity reconstruction of their environment was performed (for details, see Section
3.3.2). TL dating was performed on these samples. Later, 34 ﬂints
showing signs of heating were collected during the new excavations for TL dating. Combustion features (n 5, 23, 24) from Layer 9
were sampled and heated sediments (respectively Bdx 13397,
13394, 13396) were studied by OSL to determine the age of
combustion. Finally two stratigraphic sections, left intact at the end

of the campaign in squares J16eJ17 (Bdx 13401e13407) and H17
(Bdx 13408e13413, cf. Fig. 2), were sampled and sediments were
studied by OSL to determine their age of deposition.
The external part of the ﬂints was removed using a low speed
water-cooled diamond saw in order to eliminate the part that was
irradiated by alpha and beta particles from their environment. The
inner part was then gently crushed to a grain size less than 160 mm.
Sieving allowed isolating the 100e160 mm fraction that was treated
with hydrochloric acid and rinsed with water, ethanol and acetone.
Laser grain size analysis was performed on the sediment samples,
and after sieving the dominant fraction (20e40 mm) was selected.
Chemical treatments consisted of cleaning with HCl to remove
carbonates, with H2O2 to eliminate organic materials and ﬁnally
H2SiF6 for 3 days to remove feldspars. After rinsing with HCl to remove
any precipitated ﬂuorides and sieving to eliminate the remaining
feldspars partially etched by H2SiF6, the remaining quartz was
mounted on stainless steel discs using silicone oil. Each quartz sample
was checked for purity by an IRSL-test on three discs, and the samples
exhibiting IRSL signals were treated again with H2SiF6 for 3 days.
3.2. Equivalent dose determination
3.2.1. TL
The TL glow curves were obtained using a specially constructed
TL apparatus and heating in N2 at a rate of 4  C s 1. The photomultiplier tube (EMI 9213 QKA) used for photon counting and a set
composed of two Schott BG12 and one MTO Ta3 optical ﬁlters lead
to a spectral window in the blue and UV region of TL. Beta irradiations were performed with a 90Sr/90Y beta source. Preliminary
tests were performed to evaluate the past heating state of the ﬂints
by checking whether the TL signal was saturated (Valladas, 1985):
a comparison between natural and additive TL glow curves lead to
20 ﬂints being rejected, leaving 16 ﬂints for the dating study.
Fig. 4 shows TL glow curves of sample Bdx 13281, as well as
natural and regenerated (after resetting at 350  C for 90 min)
growth curves of TL signal as a function of dose. A multiple aliquot
additive/regenerative dose protocol was applied, 4 aliquots being
measured for each additive/regenerative point (e.g. Mercier et al.,
2007a); the regenerated curves were used to evaluate the supralinearity of growth curves at low doses.
3.2.2. OSL, single aliquots
OSL measurements were performed with a Risø TL-Da 20
automated reader (Bøtter-Jensen et al., 2000) equipped with blue
LEDs and 7.5 mm of Hoya U-340 ﬁlter for the detection window, as
well as a 90Sr/90Y beta source. A multi-grain single-aliquot and
regenerative dose (SAR) protocol (Murray and Wintle, 2000, 2003;
Wintle and Murray, 2006) was used. In addition to internal tests
(recycling ratio and thermal transfer), dose recovery tests were
performed for each sample. The ratios of obtained to expected dose
were consistent with unity, at 2s. Linearly-Modulated OSL signals
showed that for all the samples, the signal was dominated by the
fast component (Bailey et al., 1997; Jain et al., 2003).
For each sample, 30 aliquots (diameter: 1 mm) containing
several thousand grains were measured. Fig. 5 shows the growth
curve for sample Bdx 13396 and the radial plots of Equivalent Doses
(ED). Recuperation ratios were all less than 5%, and aliquots that did
not recycle within unity at 2s were rejected. Considering the
number of grains on each disc, the expected distribution of EDs was
Gaussian. Therefore, the weighted mean of all measured EDs was
used to obtain an ED value for each sample.
3.2.3. OSL, single grains
One sediment sample (Bdx 13402) was studied using a Risø
automated reader (Duller et al., 1999; Bøtter-Jensen et al., 2003)

study was used to derive effective uranium contents for all
samples.
The radioisotopic contents being signiﬁcantly lower in ﬂints,
a fraction of each sample was sent to the Centre d’Analyse des Roches

equipped with a 10 mW Nd:YVO4 solid-state diode-pumped
laser emitting at 532 nm, with 7.5 mm of Hoya U-340 ﬁlter for
the detection window, and a 90Sr/90Y beta source. Fig. 6 shows
the radial plot of the ED distribution, determined on 113 grains
(size: 180e220 mm) out of 2400, after application of the aforementioned rejection criteria. A supplementary criterion was
applied: all grains showing a statistical uncertainty on their test
dose signal lower than 20% were rejected. For this sample the
Central Age Model (Galbraith et al., 1999) was used to determine
the ED.
3.3. Dose rate determination
3.3.1. Alpha and beta dose rates
High resolution gamma spectrometry measurements were
performed on the sediment samples, using HP-Ge spectrometers
(Guibert and Schvoerer, 1991). Potassium, uranium and thorium
contents were determined, and a detailed study of disequilibria
in the 238U series e involving alpha spectrometry e has already
been published by some of the present authors (Guibert et al.,
2009). The single-event enrichment model described in this

For each sample, K, effective U (i.e. taking the disequilibrium
state into account) and Th contents, as well as the different
contributions to dose rates, equivalent doses and corresponding
ages, are given in Table 1 (OSL ages) and Table 2 (TL ages). Fig. 8
shows these ages as a function of archaeological layers. The ﬁrst
observation is that the interpretation of the results is not
straightforward: TL and OSL chronological sequences do not seem
compatible. A critical discussion of the ages is, therefore, necessary to evaluate the relevance of these ages to the chronology of
Neanderthal occupations at Roc de Marsal.

3.3.2. Gamma and cosmic dose rates
Radioisotopic contents for the sediments samples exhibited
a high variability (cf. Table 1): relative standard deviations are
respectively 36%, 25% and 30% for potassium, uranium and
thorium. Sediment samples situated 20 cm from each other
sometimes show variations in radioisotopic contents by a factor
between 2 and 3. The range of gamma rays being of several tens of
centimetres, conversion of K, U and Th in gamma dose rates
seemed fraught with hazard.
As a consequence, direct measurements of gamma dose rates
were performed by inserting 25 dosimeters in the sediments. Ten
were placed in the sediments in 2003, before the start of the
excavation process. Then in 2009, 15 additional dosimeters were
placed at the location of the sediment samples taken from squares
H17 and J16eJ17. Fig. 7 shows the corresponding gamma dose rate
values. Variations can be explained by the proﬁle of the sections in
which the dosimeters were inserted: sediments are sandwiched
between the bedrock and a layer of blocks that fell from the roof.
Gamma dose rates are, therefore, particularly variable close to the
interfaces between sediments and calcareous rocks.
These variations were anticipated at the time of the sampling
campaign in 2003. To overcome this source of potentially important uncertainties, an excavation was undertaken to record,
localize and weigh every piece of rock of dimensions greater than
5 cm, whose radioisotopic contents were determined by high
resolution gamma spectrometry. Sediment samples were also
regularly collected around the dated objects (ﬂints Bdx 9072 and
9102, sediments samples Bdx 9054, 9090 and 9092) for a reconstruction of their gamma dose rate environment, according to the
methodology published by Guibert et al. (1998). Details regarding
this speciﬁc reconstruction process have been described by
Guibert et al., 2007, in Sandgathe et al. (2007).
Finally cosmic dose rates were measured by in-situ gamma
spectrometry, by recording the total dose rate deposited in the
3e11 MeV energy range of a NaI (2 inches by 2 inches) portable
gamma spectrometer, with a similar approach as what was
described by Løvborg et al. (1979) and Prescott and Hutton (1988).

Sample

et Minéraux (Nancy, France). Potassium content was determined
by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry,
and uranium and thorium contents by Inductively Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometry.
These radioisotopic contents were then converted in dose
rates using the conversion factors from Guérin et al. (2011). Alpha
sensitivity of burnt ﬂints was measured for each sample, using
a 241Am source. For quartz, an alpha sensitivity of 5 mGy/
103 alpha/cm2 was assumed (Tribolo et al., 2001). Attenuation
factors of Mejdahl (1979) and Brennan et al. (1991) were used for
the calculation of the beta and alpha dose rates, respectively. The
water content was measured at the time of sampling, and it was
assumed that this value (12.5%) prevailed during the burial
time.

inserted in the sections of the site: a) square H17 and b) square J16eJ17.

4.1. Resetting of luminescence signals

Depending on the nature of the dating objects, two mechanisms are to be considered: for heated sediments and ﬂints,
luminescence signals (TL and OSL) are reset by the heating itself,
whereas in the case of unheated sediments exposure to sunlight is
responsible for zeroing the OSL signal. In the ﬁrst case, TL plateau
tests were performed to check whether the heating was sufﬁcient
for a total resetting of the signal; only the samples passing this test
were dated. In the second case, no such test exists and one cannot
rule out the possibility of partial bleaching of the OSL signal for
unheated sediments. At Roc de Marsal sediments are in general
poorly sorted, and the majority are not of aeolian origin. A
hypothesis for the inﬁlling mechanisms is that sediments would
have been deposited through mudﬂows, in which case exposure
to sunlight may have been insufﬁcient to fully reset the OSL signal
at deposition time. Even more problematic is the in-situ alteration
of the bedrock, which contains quartz meaning that quartz grains
in the sediments might never have been exposed to sunlight.

4.2. Heterogeneities in dosimetry

Two scales of heterogeneities are to be considered in this
study: the range of gamma rays is of several tens of cm, whereas
the range of beta particles is of a few mm.

4.2.1. Gamma dose rates to heated samples
According to the nature of the dated samples, two different
situations occurred regarding gamma dose rate determination. The
location of objects related to human activity, such as heated ﬂints or
combustion features, is unknown before excavations. Hence for
these samples gamma dose rate measurements could not be performed at their burial location. Given the high variability of gamma
dose rates at Roc de Marsal, especially for top and bottom Layers e
which are close to uneven surfaces such as calcareous bedrock or
blocks from the roof fall e one can expect relatively high uncertainties on gamma dose rates received by dated samples. Indeed for
burnt ﬂints and sediments from combustion features, gamma dose
rates were estimated using distant measurements. Notable exceptions are the ﬂints Bdx 9072 and 9102, as well as heated sediments
Bdx 9054, 9090 and 9092 for which the environment radioactivity
was reconstructed (Section 3.3.2). Alternatively, for the sediment
samples from the sections in squares H17 and J16eJ17, dosimeters
were inserted at the location of sampling.
4.2.2. Beta dose rates to sedimentary quartz grains
In the case of sediment samples, beta dose rates have been
deduced from the radioisotopic contents of the samples themselves. Sediment composition is locally variable and consists of
calcium carbonate (both limestone, ashes and some secondary
carbonates), phosphates, quartz silt, clay, sand, bones, and lithics in
variable quantities; radioisotopic contents are highly variable in
such different materials. As a consequence beta dose rate to quartz
is difﬁcult to measure. During sample preparation for gamma
spectrometry, large elements (>1 cm) were removed before the
ﬁne fractions were crushed to homogenize the samples, since the
20e40 mm quartz grains are part of the ﬁne sediments. However,
this precaution may not be sufﬁcient, since even removing the large
elements does not solve the mm scale heterogeneity problem.
To tackle such heterogeneities at the mm scale, three slices of
impregnated sediment samples were analysed with imaging plates
showing the distribution of radioelements (Fig. 9) e following the
approach of Rufer and Preusser (2009). These imaging plates
mostly characterize beta radiations, which account for between 45
and 65% of the total dose rate received by sedimentary quartz
grains. At this stage, only qualitative statements can be made:
Monte Carlo simulations of particleematter interactions might

allow quantifying microdosimetry effects, but this goes beyond the
scope of this study. Sample PG-401 (Fig. 9a) encompasses Layers 7
and 8 in square H 18. On the top part of this sample one can see
a dark layer, very rich in charcoal, which is associated with
combustion feature 16. The autoradiograph of this sample shows
several features: low radioactivity layers are noted for a calcareous
block (on the right) and a bean shaped brown loose patch in the
centre of the sample. Moreover the part rich in charcoal (top of the
photos) appears in lighter grey than the rest of the autoradiograph
e which reveals lower radioisotopic contents. More generally, one
can identify a great number of radioactive hotspots e possibly
potassium feldspars or heavy minerals such as zircons, monazites,
etc. The effect of these hotspots is that dose rate distributions for
single quartz grains are very complex, and that determination of
beta dose rates to quartz grains by conversion of radioisotopic
contents may induce errors. Indeed whether the quartz grains are
close or distant to hotspots e the range of beta particles being
1e2 mm, i.e. lower than typical distances between hotspots e will
greatly affect the dose rate they received during burial. Sample PG413 (Fig. 9b) comes from Layer 9 (and 10 at the bottom) and shows
an ash layer from combustion feature 18. It exhibits even more
complex patterns: sub-horizontal layers of different radioactivity
layers are visible; moreover hotspots also appear clearly, and the
distance between them is greater than for sample PG-401. This
means that quartz grains have a lower probability of having been
buried close to one of them e beta dose rate seems, therefore, even
more hazardous. Finally, sample PG-414 (Fig. 9c) comes from
square N16 (Layers F-3 and F-4) and shows a distribution of hotspots: most grains on the exposed surface are at least 2 mm away
from closest hotspots e therefore, the radioisotopic contents,
measured in the samples using gamma spectrometry, might not be
the relevant physical quantities to derive beta dose rates to quartz
grains.
Unfortunately, these samples for beta dose rate mapping were
not the same as dated sediments e hence the conclusions of this
study only have a qualitative, general signiﬁcance. Nonetheless, all
samples exhibit hotspots, and one may assume that the combustion
features, since they all present the same kind of features
throughout the site, have similar characteristics as sample PG-413,
taken from combustion feature 18. Further studies should associate
OSL studies and microdosimetry characterization to exploit the full
advantages of such analysis combinations.
4.3. Hypothesis for the chronology
4.3.1. Different materials, different stories
If one tries to summarize the potential problems affecting the
different ages shown in Fig. 8, three situations occur, based on
different parameters/effects that could affect the dating study,
namely microdosimetry heterogeneities, luminescence signal
resetting and gamma dose rate determination.
First, OSL ages determined on unheated sediment samples
(empty symbols in Fig. 8) may be affected by:
 Possible partial luminescence signal resetting e or even inexistent resetting if quartz grains are the result of in-situ bedrock
decomposition.
 Microdosimetry effects, which are a consequence of the
complex, heterogeneous radioelement distributions as shown
in Fig. 9. Important over-dispersion in equivalent dose distributions are, therefore, expected because of both signal resetting problems and microdosimetry effects.
 However, for these samples, gamma dose rates were measured
at sampling location, and it was assumed that these dose rates
were representative of those during burial.

Fig. 9. Scan of beta emissions (on the right) of corresponding impregnated sediments samples (a: sample PG-401; b: PG-413; c: PG-414) from the Roc de Marsal (photographs in
natural light on the right). A great number of hotspots can be identiﬁed, as well as distinct layers in the case of the sample PG-413 (b).

It should be noted that single grain analysis provides a way of
looking into the two ﬁrst problems. For this reason the sample Bdx
13402 (quartz grains in the 180e250 mm fraction) was studied with
a single grain reader (grey star symbol, Fig. 8). Two different
components, such as those observed by Tribolo et al. (2010) and
that were interpreted as the sign of post-depositional mixing of
grains, could not be isolated. Application of the Central Age Model
on single grain data for sample Bdx 13402 gave an age of
75.8  5.8 ka, whereas for the same sample the age determined on
single aliquots was 87.6  4.5 ka. This important difference and the
over-dispersion of single grain EDs (44%) conﬁrm that this sample
has a complex dosimetry history; however, at this stage one cannot
determine if this over-dispersion is due to partial bleaching at the
time of deposition, to microdosimetry heterogeneities, to different
sedimentary histories of the ﬁne and coarse grains fractions, or to
a combination of these effects e and in the latter case, what fraction

of the over-dispersion is due to which cause. Since the effects of
these potential effects could not be quantiﬁed at this stage, no
further modelling was performed, all the more since Thomsen et al.
(in press) recently reported a dose dependency of the overdispersion of quartz OSL equivalent doses in gamma dosed
samples.
For OSL and TL ages on heated sediments (respectively upwardspointing full triangles, Layer 9, and downwards-pointing full
triangles, Layer 11, in Figs. 8 and 10):
 Luminescence signal resetting is assumed, since careful excavation of the combustion features was performed under
subdued light laboratory conditions.
 Microdosimetry effects seem even worse in this case, as
attested by the autoradiographs obtained in such cases (Fig. 9a
and b). Despite the precautions taken for small scale sampling

3080

G. Guérin et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 39 (2012) 3071e3084

calculate a mean maximum age for the heated samples from Layer 9. If
one assumes a gamma dose rate of 0.25 Gy ka 1 for all these samples
(which is the lowest possible value for gamma dose rates in the
sediments directly atop the bedrock), the average of age for Layer 9 is
74 ka, which means that this layer cannot be attributed to MIS 5.

Fig. 10. Interpretative summary of luminescence ages determined on heated samples.
12 of the 15 ages for the part of the sequence composed of Layers 7, 8 and 9 fall within
MIS 4. Previous occupations, not related to lithics but attested by heated sediments, are
attributed to MIS 5. The chronological position of the Quina layers is less documented
and could be attributed to the end of MIS 4 (Heinrich event 6?) or to MIS 3. For the
symbols signiﬁcance, see Fig. 7.

of the combustion features, one cannot rule out the possibility
that layers of different radioisotopic contents were sampled for
gamma spectrometry e which requires approx. 10 g of
sediments.
 For these samples, whose location was unknown before excavation, there is potential inadequacy between measured
gamma dose rates and gamma dose rates actually received by
the samples.
Finally for the burnt ﬂints dated by TL (other full symbols in
Figs. 8 and 9):
 Luminescence signal resetting was tested using the plateau test
e samples failing this test were rejected.
 Flints are homogeneous in terms of radioelement distribution
on a mm scale (e.g. Selo et al., 2009).
 There is potential inadequacy between measured gamma dose
rates and gamma dose rates actually received by the samples,
as for heated sediments.
This latter point probably explains the important dispersion on
ages measured for artefacts from Layer 9. Even though these 11
samples (heated sediments and ﬂints) are far from being statistically sufﬁcient for a satisfactory detailed analysis, one can assume
that average gamma dose rates are well estimated, and that the
spread of ages is due to statistical errors. Going further, given the
limited thickness of this layer (approx. 10 cm) and its homogeneity
in terms of materials, one can formulate the hypothesis that the
material deposition corresponding to these occupations occurred
during a time period that is small compared to the uncertainties of
individual ages (6 ka in average for individual s). If this hypothesis
was veriﬁed e which unfortunately cannot be proven or disproven
e then the average of ages would allow the statistical errors on
gamma dose rates to be accounted for. In such a case, 67  2 ka
(uncertainty is given as the standard error on mean) corresponds to
the age of Layer 9, at the base of the sequence, when considering
ages for heated ﬂints and quartz from combustion features. This
average would become 64  2 ka when considering only burnt
ﬂints, which are not affected by microdosimetry effects.
Despite a potential inadequate gamma dose rate for these
samples, the 25 dosimeters e which were inserted in the sediments e
provide a range for possible gamma dose rates. One can, therefore,

4.3.2. Interpretative summary of the ages
Now that three subsets of ages can be distinguished based on
their physical properties (heated quartz, heated ﬂints, and
unheated quartz), one can try and look at these three subsets on
a wider scale. Ages on unheated material exhibit stratigraphic
inversions: the determined ages for Layers 8 and 9 (Bdx 13407:
89.8  5.9 ka, 13412: 91.4  5.7 ka, 13413: 89.9  4.9) are younger
than for Layers 6 and 7 (Bdx 13405: 102.8  7.7 ka and 13406:
105.2  6.8 ka). The age determined for the sediment sample Bdx
13411 (Layer 7, age: 61.5  3.4 ka) is clearly incompatible with all
these ages. Therefore, it seems that unheated material does not
provide a set of coherent ages at Roc de Marsal. Even single grain
analysis does not provide a means of overcoming these stratigraphic inversions: the age of Bdx 13402 (Layer 4, age:
75.8  5.8 ka), determined on single grains, is still inconsistent at 1s
(and barely consistent at 2s) with the single aliquots age of sample
Bdx 13411 (Layer 7, age: 61.5  3.4 ka).
When considering the heated samples e dated either by TL or
OSL e the sequence, despite the blurring effect owing to gamma
dose rate inaccurate measurements, is coherent. Layers 7, 8 and 9
correspond to the same period, i.e. 65e69 ka (one sigma interval).
12 of the 15 ages determined on heated samples from these layers
are in MIS 4. Upper layers yielded much less heated material, only
Layer 4 provided two ages: 45.4  3.5 for Bdx 13269 and 61.0  6.8
for Bdx 13272.
Finally, ﬁve samples are particular in this study: the heated ﬂints
from Layer 9 (full squares in Figs. 8 and 10) Bdx 9072 (66.1  5.9 ka)
and 9102 (68  3.8 ka) do not suffer from a potentially problematic
gamma dose rate determination, since their radiation ﬁeld environment was reconstructed. These samples, therefore, constitute
the only examples for which there is no question regarding either
signal resetting, microdosimetry effects or potentially problematic
gamma dose rate determination. It is striking to see that these ages
lie at the centre of the distribution of ages for Layer 9, which
supports the interpretation of the spread in ages, for heated
materials from Layer 9, as the result of statistical errors on gamma
dose rates. We, therefore, consider these ages as the marker for this
chronological study, all the more since the ages for the rest of
heated materials are intrinsically coherent. The other three samples
for which gamma reconstruction was performed are the heated
sediments (full downwards-pointing triangles in Figs. 8 and 10)
from Laﬁlle’s Layer B e the samples were taken before the recent
excavations, so no clear correlation could be made but it most
probably corresponds to the new Layer 11 (it could also be Layer
12). Even though this layer did not yield any lithics, ﬁre was made at
Roc de Marsal and is dated back to 77e87 ka, i.e. at the end of MIS 5.
5. Roc de Marsal chronology in a regional perspective
The determined ages can now be viewed in relation to the
environmental data, both on a site and regional scales. For clarity, in
Fig. 10 only the ages determined on heated samples e which are the
most reliable chronological data according to the preceding section
e are plotted as a function of stratigraphic layers.
Luminescence dating results indicate that Layers 7, 8 and 9
correspond to occupations during the MIS 4. Fig. 11 shows macrofaunal remains for the different layers of Roc de Marsal. The
abundance of red deer and roe deer in the layers at the base of the
sequence tend to indicate a wooded environment, even when the

Ungulates (% NISP)
Fig. 11. NISP percentages of macrofaunal remains of the different ungulate taxa found at the Roc de Marsal site by archaeological Layer. Data was compiled from previous analyses of
the Laﬁlle collection by M. Patou-Mathis (in Sandgathe et al., 2007) and of the recent excavations by J.-C. Castel (in Sandgathe et al., 2007; Castel and Dibble, in prep.) for Layers 4, 5,
7 and M.C. Soulier (2007) for Layer 2. Only Layers with a total NISP exceeding 100 are included.

ecological plasticity of ungulates is considered (Discamps et al.,
2011). This had led, up to now, to the suggestion that the corresponding layers correspond to MIS 5 (Sandgathe et al., 2011a;
Goldberg et al., 2012), because this period is generally believed to
be more temperate than the MIS 4.
However, palaeoclimatic and palynologic analyses carried out on
a deep-sea core drilled in the Bay of Biscay (Sanchez Goñi et al., 2008),
a few hundred km west of Roc de Marsal, have shown that the MIS 4
palaeoenvironments were more variable than one might expect. The
sediments analysed in this core represent three main ﬂuvial sources:
the Adour River, the Garonne River and the Loire River and, therefore,
palaeoenvironmental reconstructions based on this core correspond
to a broad southwest France. This wide regional scale limits the
information that can be drawn for the Roc de Marsal environments,
but it is worth noting that between 65 and 70 ka, the vegetation in
southwestern France consisted of approximately 50e60% of steppe
species and 40e50% of forest e mainly boreal (Fletcher et al., 2010)
species. Interestingly, the fauna at Roc de Marsal exhibit a singular
pattern: for Layers 7, 8 and, to a lesser degree, 9, forest-adapted taxa
(red deer, roe deer) dominate the spectrum but reindeer, which is
often associated with dry, cold open-air environments, also
contributes to a signiﬁcant fraction of the remains (respectively 22,
33 and 11% of NISP for Layers 7, 8 and 9).
This rather strange association could correspond to: 1) a mosaic
landscape with, for example, simultaneous development of forests
in valleys, and grasslands on plateaus or 2) a palimpsest of multiple
occupations that occurred in different environments changing on
a short time scale, following DansgaardeOeschger events, for
example. However, if these three ungulates are preferentially
adapted to different environments, they are also known for their
ecological plasticity: red deer ranges from mixed forests to open
forests with grassland and can even tolerate steppe environments;
roe deer, if they preferentially inhabit wooded environments, may
live in open country (ﬁeld roe deer ecotype); reindeer, if they are
well adapted to open treeless spaces, can also live in taiga and
forested mountainous regions (detailed discussion and references
in Discamps et al., 2011). In fact, red deer, roe deer, and reindeer can
live in boreal forests.
In southwest France, Roc de Marsal Layers 7e9 are not an
exception, as similar faunal patterns have been observed in other

archaeological sites. It is striking to see that for sequences that
span both Quina and Typical Mousterian, a number of similar
features have been observed: ﬁrst, Quina Mousterian layers are
always on top of Typical Mousterian layers (Jaubert, 2010);
second, Quina Mousterian is, in Dordogne, always associated with
faunal remains dominated by reindeer; third, in the layers underlying Quina industries, fauna exhibits singular patterns combining
“forest-adapted” (red deer and/or roe deer) and “cold open-air”
species (reindeer). Fig. 12 shows the evolution in the patterns of
faunal remains in the following sites of the Dordogne region of
France: Pech de l’Azé II, Pech De l’Azé IV, Combe-Grenal (Laquay,
1981), Regourdou, Vaufrey (Delpech, 1996) and Roc de Marsal.
Faunal data from Pech de l’Azé IV do not come from the recent
excavations of this site but from the analysis of the Bordes excavation’s faunal collection (Laquay, 1981); for correspondence
between Bordes layers and the new excavation layers, please refer
to Turq et al., 2008. At the top of Fig. 12 dominant species are given
as a function of the layers of these different sites, and at the bottom
one can see that the percentage of reindeer progressively increases
from “AnteQuina” (various Mousterian techno-complexes underlying Quina Mousterian) to Quina Mousterian layers. In terms of
chronology, Layer 2E from Pech de l’Azé II was dated by ESR on
teeth to approx. 57e60  6 ka (Grün et al., 1991) and these ages
were part of a coherent, comprehensive study of 29 samples from
this site; Combe-Grenal layers were bracketed between 44  4 and
68  7 ka by TL on heated ﬂints (Bowman and Sieveking, 1983) but
the studied grain size fraction (1e8 mm in diameter) is prone to
triboluminescence, which makes these ages rather uncertain; layer
II from Vaufrey gave a U/Th age of 74  18 ka (Blackwell and
Schwarcz, in Rigaud (dir.), 1988) but the important uncertainty
and the nature of the sample (calcite fragments) render the interpretation of this age difﬁcult. One can, nonetheless, formulate the
hypothesis that this faunal pattern corresponds to particular
climatic conditions in this region of France, at a particular time. At
Roc de Marsal this period of transition from temperate to cold
conditions seems to have occurred in the middle of MIS 4, which is
consistent with chronological information from the abovementioned sites. Analysis of the faunal assemblages at a regional
scale suggests that the most probable time interval corresponding
to the change from composite reindeer/red deer/roe deer faunas at

Fig. 12. Top: stratigraphic distribution of hunted prey in “AnteQuina” and Quina assemblages from the Dordogne region, by dominant taxa (a) and evolution in the percentage of
Reindeer remains (b). Each line is a sequence and each block is an assemblage represented according to its stratigraphic position; dashed blocks are assemblages with doubts on
their technotypological attribution or stratigraphic integrity. Bottom: evolution in main pollen types from independent paleoenvironmental data (modiﬁed after Fletcher et al.,
2010) and proposed correlations with main faunal changes (dashed lines).

the end of the “AnteQuina” to reindeer dominated faunas in the
Quina might be the middle of MIS 4 (Fig. 12; Discamps et al., 2011),
when southwest France was for a great part covered with boreal
forest (Sanchez-Goñi et al., 2008; Fletcher et al., 2010).
For the rest of the stratigraphic sequence at Roc de Marsal,
chronological information is unfortunately much poorer, owing to
the lower fraction of heated material. A summary of ages determined for Quina Mousterian occupations in the region can be found
in Guibert et al. (2008) and the corresponding ages refer to the
following sites: Chapelle aux Saints (Corrèze, France: ESR by Grün
and Stringer, 1991), Regourdou (Dordogne, France: radiocarbon by
Vogel and Waterbolk, 1967), Espagnac (Lot, France: ESR by Falguères, in Jaubert (dir.), 2001), Sous les Vignes (Lot-et-Garonne,
France: ESR by Valladas et al., 1999) and Combe-Grenal (Dordogne,
France: TL by Bowman and Sieveking, 1983). The ages determined
for this industry are all between 39 and 54 ka e i.e. during MIS 3,
which is consistent with one of the two ages of Layer 4 at Roc de

Marsal (Bdx 13269, age: 45.4  3.5 ka), the other one being
consistent with MIS 3 or the very end of MIS 4 (Bdx 13272:
61.0  5.8 ka). The latter is consistent with recent data from Les
Pradelles (Charente, France), where Quina deposits were dated by
TL to 57.6  4.8 ka (Vieillevigne and Guibert, 2007).
Chronological data suggest that the Quina corresponds either to
the very end of MIS 4 or to the MIS 3. Fauna associated with the
Quina Mousterian industry is clearly dominated by reindeer, both
at Roc de Marsal and in other Quina sites of this region, suggesting
cold steppic conditions more consistent with the very end of MIS 4
(Discamps et al., 2011), but further data will be needed to discuss
possible correlations with particular climatic events.
6. Conclusion
Given the complex stratigraphy of Roc de Marsal in terms of
radioactivity heterogeneities at different scales, the coupling of TL

G. Guérin et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 39 (2012) 3071e3084

and OSL on different materials was necessary to determine a chronological scenario for the human occupations at this site. Accurate
reconstruction of radioactive environments, for some of the heated
samples, played a signiﬁcant role in the dating study. Data suggest
an occupation characterized by Denticulate Mousterian during the
middle of MIS 4 (Layers 7, 8 and 9: 65e70 ka). Quina Mousterian
layers, based on ages for Layer 4, are dated to between 45.4  3.5 ka
and 61  6.8 ka which is consistent with other chronological data in
the region for the same industry that place it at the end of MIS 4 or
in MIS 3. Consequently, our results, when combined with other ongoing research in the area (Guibert et al., 2008; Discamps et al.,
2011; Sanchez-Goñi et al., 2008) paint a more complex picture
that imply the two following a priori unexpected considerations:
ﬁrst, that MIS 4 was probably not uniformly extremely cold in
southwest France, since red deer and roe deer would have been
present during the ﬁrst half of this period; second, that the
maximum cold, as measured by the almost exclusive presence of
reindeer, occurred most probably at the very end of MIS 4 e or
during MIS 3. This is consistent with palaeoenvironmental reconstructions based on palynological studies in this region of France,
since forest environments and steppes were simultaneously
covering similar fractions of landscapes between 65 and 70 ka, the
minimum forest covering occurring at the end of MIS 4 (60e62 ka,
meaning a possible correlation with Heinrich event 6) and during
MIS 3. Moreover, the deposition of the skeleton of the Neanderthal
infant is now bracketed; according to its stratigraphic position e
probably below the Quina layers (Sandgathe et al., 2011a) e it can
now be assigned most probably to MIS 4, between 60 and 70 ka.
