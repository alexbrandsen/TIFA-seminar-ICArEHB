Behavioural Complexity in Eurasian Neanderthal Populations

Behavioural Complexity in Eurasian Neanderthal
Populations: a Chronological Examination of the
Archaeological Evidence
Michelle C. Langley, Christopher Clarkson & Sean Ulm
Whether Neanderthals were capable of behaviours commonly held to be the exclusive
preserve of modern humans — such as abstract thought, language, forward planning, art,
reverence of the dead, complex technology, etc. — has remained a fundamental question in
human evolutionary studies since their discovery more than a hundred years ago. A lack
of quantitative data on Neanderthal symbolism and complex behaviour is a key obstacle to
the resolution of this question, with temporal analyses usually confined to single regions
or short time periods. Here we present an approach to the issue of symbolism and complex
behaviours among Neanderthals that examines the frequency of key proxies for symbolic
and complex behaviours through time, including burials, modified raw materials, use of
pigments, use of composite technology and body modification. Our analysis demonstrates
that the number and diversity of complex Neanderthal behaviours increases between
160,000 and 40,000 years ago. Whether this pattern derives from preservation factors, the
evolution of cognitive and behavioural complexity, cumulative learning, or population size is
discussed. We take the view that it is not the apparent sophistication of a single specific item,
nor the presence or absence of particular types in the archaeological record that is important.
Instead, we believe that it is the overall abundance of artefacts and features indicative of
complex behaviours within the Neanderthal archaeological record as a whole that should
provide the mark of Neanderthal capabilities and cultural evolutionary potential.

In recent years, Neanderthal behavioural capacities

behaviour of modern human populations as a baseline
(i.e. ‘modernity’). This is because the term ‘behavioural
modernity’ creates a distinction between the ‘modern’
and ‘non-modern’. A good measure of modernity
must, by its very nature, differentiate Neanderthals
from modern humans in order to be successful.
In the strictest sense, it could be argued that no
Palaeolithic population is ‘modern’. Modern human
diversity and complexity, as in the cultural, technological and economic behaviours of humans alive today,
far exceeds anything in existence in the Middle or
Upper Palaeolithic, and hence no current archaeological index of modernity in use in this debate would be
adequate to encapsulate contemporary diversity. Most
importantly, we should not expect all modern humans

have been central to debate surrounding the origins
of behavioural modernity. Primarily, this is owing to
the prominence of models which have focused on
comparing the archaeological record of Neanderthals
with that of later modern humans in order to determine whether Neanderthals were capable of ‘modern
behaviour’ (e.g. d’Errico 2003; Mellars 2005).
A preliminary stumbling block in discussions
of behavioural modernity is the inappropriateness
of this framework for comparing the cognitive and
behavioural capabilities of modern humans with
other hominin species. Neanderthals, as a distinct and
extinct hominin species, cannot be directly compared
to modern humans where that comparison uses the

(or non-modern humans) to behave in the same way at
all periods in the past no matter what their cognitive
abilities. Population density, historical contingency,
environment and economy all shape human societies
in profound ways, giving rise to the immense cultural
diversity documented throughout human history.
These aspects were likely strong shaping factors in
the cultural differences between populations such as
Pleistocene Aboriginal Australians and Aurignacian
people, for instance, who, while both modern humans
with identical cognitive abilities and near contemporaries as founding populations on new continents,
possessed markedly different material culture and
archaeological signatures of symbolic expression.
The point we are making is simply that the
concept and terminology of the modernity debate is
problematic on several levels. As our objective is to
compare constructively Neanderthals and modern
humans, we therefore seek an analytical framework
that does not force a distinction between the two species, such as modernity requires. We argue that we
are in fact debating the archaeological signature of
behavioural and cognitive complexity when we compare the modern human and Neanderthal records, not
the nonsensical issue of modernity which Neanderthals
cannot, nor should not, possess. We therefore shift our
focus in this article from modernity to complexity and
hope others engaged in this debate will find this a
productive framework within which to advance new
arguments.

As well as adherence to the modernity concept,
current comparisons of behavioural complexity among
modern humans and Neanderthals have been hampered by problematic analytical techniques, an issue
which has been highlighted in recent years (d’Errico
2003; Henshilwood & Marean 2003; McBrearty &
Brooks 2000). The use of trait lists originally based on
the Aurignacian archaeological record and later modified to include instances of complexity from modern
human populations in southern Africa (McBrearty &
Brooks 2000), have resulted in a deeply problematic
tool for identifying behavioural modernity. In reality,
the trait list approach excludes many contemporaneous and present-day modern human populations that
lack the exact set of criteria on which these appraisals
of modernity are based. Additionally, some artefact
types included in these lists (e.g. blades) show poor
correlations with phases of cultural efflorescence typically linked to the appearance of modernity (like the
Aurignacian) (e.g. Bar-Yosef & Kuhn 1999; Cosgrove
& Pike-Tay 2004; Davidson 2003), nor do they show
well-demonstrated linkages to the kinds of higher
cognitive processes thought to mark behavioural
modernity (d’Errico 2003; Bar-Yosef & Kuhn 1999;
McBrearty & Brooks 2000).
Another common problem in dealing with the
issue of origins and changing levels of complexity
in modern and archaic human species surrounds the
treatment of time. Most analyses of the emergence
of behavioural complexity among modern humans,
Neanderthals, or both, have adopted synchronic
approaches that treat the archaeological records of
populations as single analytical units (e.g. d’Errico
2003; Hayden 1993; Mellars 2005). This restricts
analyses to simple synchronic comparisons rather
than detailed diachronic examinations of changes in
levels of behavioural complexity apparent within the
record. While diachronic studies of the Neanderthal
archaeological record exist, these have ultimately
lacked the rigorous chronological framework and
quantitative data required to assess changing levels of
complexity as opposed to other kinds of behavioural
change (e.g. Mellars 2004; Rolland & Dibble 1990). We
believe a resolution to the problem of Neanderthal
behavioural complexity requires new approaches
rather than just more evidence.
As the issue centres on the emergence and development of behavioural complexity rather than modernity, we have developed a chronological approach to
the problem that examines the archaeological occurrence of artefacts and features that can be considered
complex or symbolic in nature through time. The
quantitative and chronological analysis of the archaeo-

Measuring behavioural complexity
Multiple theories have been proposed to account
for the origin and development of behavioural complexity over the last few decades, and this remains
a hotly debated issue in contemporary Palaeolithic
archaeology. Some theorists have suggested a single
origin for the complex behaviours appearing in
Europe 40–35,000 years ago, and have linked these
new behaviours to genetic mutations which gave rise
to changes in brain architecture and a subsequent
virtual ‘human revolution’ (Klein 1995; 2000; Klein &
Edgar 2002; Mellars 1996). Others have pointed to the
African Middle Stone Age as the likely locus for many
of the complex behavioural developments seen among
modern humans (d’Errico et al. 1998; McBrearty &
Brooks 2000; Henshilwood & Marean 2003; Mellars
2005). Another group has argued for similar trends
in the emergence of behavioural complexity among
both modern humans and Neanderthals, suggesting
that complex behaviours cannot be tied to a single
species (d’Errico 2003; Zilhão 2007).

Behavioural Complexity in Eurasian Neanderthal Populations

logical record presented here focuses on the emergence of complex behavioural manifestations among
Neanderthals to determine whether the archaeological
signal of behavioural complexity is static or variable
over time. This was achieved by compiling a data
base of securely dated artefacts and features unambiguously associated with Eurasian Neanderthals that
can be argued to represent cognitively sophisticated
behaviours, and examining their frequency through
time. In this article we have focused exclusively on
Neanderthals, and no comparisons are made with the
modern human archaeological record.

processes should include multi-component tools
and modified raw materials that require precise
knowledge of raw material sources, properties, design
features and multiple manufacturing steps and stages
required in their assembly, operation and maintenance.
They should also include practices such as the burial
of the dead, use of personal ornamentation, the
use of decorative pigments on surfaces (as seen
from striations on pieces of pigment) and body
modification. These practices likely reflect complex
and largely abstract thoughts about the transition from
life to death, cosmology and the material signification
of relationships with others (McBrearty & Brooks 2000;
d’Errico et al. 2003).
It should be noted that what we are proposing
as viable indicators of complexity are not unusual in
the sense that the same markers are currently used
in many archaeological analyses of complexity in
Palaeolithic societies (d’Errico et al. 2003; Hayden
1993; Henshilwood & Marean 2003; McBrearty
& Brooks 2000). Although modification of fairly
mundane materials such as bone and wood might not
be considered ‘complex’ in the same way as piercing
shells or engraving ochre, we consider these behaviours
to have typically involved multiple processing stages.
These stages would include selection, procurement and
assembly using a range of extractive and maintenance
tools to a preconceived plan.

Complexity and the archaeological record
Behavioural complexity is defined relatively as the
accumulation of ‘more parts and more connections
between parts’ in cultural systems (Price 1995, 140),
whereas symbolic thought can be defined as ‘the
ability to represent objects, people, and abstract concepts with arbitrary symbols, vocal or visual, and to
reify such symbols in cultural practice’ (McBrearty &
Brooks 2000, 492).
Combining both of these definitions, we define
complex behaviour here as that which requires
successive cognitive components that demand the
actor to plan several consecutive steps (such as those
used in the manufacture of multi-component artefacts)
before the execution of the first step, or which require
deep understanding of the operation of variables and
their complex interplay as well as their reactions to
deliberate manipulations by the actor. This last part of
the definition refers to understandings of environment
and the operation of the natural world that facilitate,
for example, catching deep water fish, making
repeated sea crossings and navigating between islands
or intentionally influencing the natural reproductive
cycles and productivity of plants and animals. Of
course, many of these complex behaviours are not
evident among earlier Palaeolithic humans.
Symbolism is more difficult to define archaeo­
logically, as unobservable abstract thought processes
are necessarily implicated in symbolic acts represented
by manifestations of ‘art’ or other forms of decoration,
and the recording or representation of information
using signs and symbols. However, there is general
consensus on what manifestations should represent
symbolism in the archaeological record. These objects
include figurative art, notational pieces, use of pigments,
ornamentation, burials and body modification (d’Errico
et al. 2003; McBrearty & Brooks 2000; Mellars 2005).
In archaeological contexts, artefacts and features
that represent these various high-level thought

Methods
For this study, we define an archaeological instance
of symbolic or complex behaviour as a single type
of artefact or feature possessing the characteristics
described above from a single site in a securely dated
context, regardless of the abundance of that artefact
type or feature. Thus, a single incised object or a
group of 250 fragments of pigment from the same
dated context each represents a single instance in our
study. Where several distinct instances of symbolic
or complex behaviour occur within a site, and these
are dated by two or more distinct dates, then each
would represent a separate instance. For the purposes
of analysis, mid-point dates were assigned in those
cases where objects were chronologically bracketed by
multiple dates. We also only include in our analysis
burials deemed ‘certain’ or ‘probable’ by Riel-Salvatore & Clark (2001) in their critical review of Middle
Palaeolithic burials.
Our data are drawn from a review of published
English and French language sources that provide
details of objects or archaeological features meeting
our criteria that are unambiguously associated with

Neanderthals. Our initial review resulted in the
identification of 98 instances of symbolic or complex
behaviour associated with Neanderthals between
160,000 and 40,000 years ago. However, if ambiguity
existed in hominin association or provenance we
excluded this instance from our data base (see Table
1 for a list of excluded artefacts). Instances attributed
to the Châtelperronian were also excluded in order to
determine whether significant change in the frequency
of complex behaviours is present within Neanderthal
populations prior to this period, thereby avoiding the
difficult issue of whether Neanderthals created the
Châtelperronian independently.
Forty-nine instances of symbolic and complex
behaviour were recognized after problematic cases
were removed, consisting of over 30 archaeological
features and more than 300 individual artefacts
from 30 sites from western and central Europe and
western Asia (Fig. 1; Table 2). Instances of symbolic
or complex behavioural expression were not ranked
owing to the difficulties inherent in such an approach
(see Brumm & Moore 2005). We therefore adopted a
simpler approach to the problem by constructing a

frequency distribution of instances through time at
20,000 year intervals.
In compiling this data set we have only
collected information on sites containing evidence of
symbolism and complex behaviour and are therefore
unable to comment at this time on the important
issue of sampling and its effects on the chronological
patterning and representativeness of the record.
Results
The 49 separate instances of symbolic and complex
behaviour are plotted by category at 20,000 year
intervals in Figure 2. Burials are the first complex
behavioural manifestations to appear in the
archaeological record at c. 150,000 years bp as seen at
Tabun, followed by a number of instances of modified
raw materials such as a wooden spear point from
Lehringen and an incised bone artefact from Taubach
at c. 120,000–125,000 years bp. The modified fossil nummulite from Tata and residue and use-wear evidence
for bone and wood working from La Quina are
included in the burgeoning appearances of modified

Differential preservation
These results immediately raise the
question of whether differential
preservation might account for the
substantial increase in symbolic/
complex instances through time. One
way of investigating this problem
is to examine the differential rates
of survival for more fragile organic
artefacts in our sample versus more
robust inorganic objects and features.
Robust artefacts and features here
include large sedimentary features
like burials and inorganic objects
such as stone artefacts. On the other
hand, fragile artefacts and features
include friable inorganic objects like
pigments, and organic objects such as
bone, wood or antler artefacts, adhesives and residues. When these two
populations of artefacts are graphed
separately, it is evident that the same
trend is mirrored in both fragile and
robust populations of artefacts, rather
than fragile objects only appearing
during the period of highest artefact
frequency — as would be expected if

The hypothesis — that differential rates of artefact survival explains the trend toward
raw materials after 100,000 years bp, along with a
more and greater diversity of complex/symbolic
number of bone and wooden artefacts exhibiting
instances later in time — is therefore more difficult to

Behavioural Complexity in Eurasian Neanderthal Populations

(Fig. 2). Climatic conditions were highly variable
throughout the period of Neanderthal existence in
Europe, with frequent oscillations between full glacial
and warm interglacial periods characterizing this
period. The warmest period occurred c. 120,000 years
bp with less extreme periods c. 100,000 and 80,000
years BP, while the coolest periods fall at c. 140,000 and
c. 65,000 years bp. Between 40,000 and 80,000 years
bp, when the increase in symbolic/complex instances
is most intensive, the climate remains relatively cold
throughout, with only short spikes of warmth which
were unlikely to result in large population expansions. Against this record of frequent and dramatic
oscillations we have a gradual trend toward a peak in
behaviourally complex archaeological manifestations
at a time of no great warming or cooling. This suggests
that the burgeoning record of Neanderthal symbolic
and complex behaviours was not simply a response
to environmental conditions.

formed end-scrapers and borers which represent
technical innovations that were largely absent from the
earlier Neanderthal technological repertoire (Soressi
2005). Dating to a period before modern human arrival
in Europe, the MTA gives rise to the manufacture of
elongated backed artefacts and the use of volumetric
Upper Palaeolithic methods of blank production that
are otherwise only known from the Howieson’s Poort
and Aurignacian technologies of modern humans in
South Africa and Europe.
In a study of lithic assemblages from the sites
of Pech de l’Aze I, Le Moustier and La Rochette,
Soressi (2005) demonstrated that the scheduling of
the knapping activities undertaken at these sites was
complex and was not driven by raw material availability. In her view, complex scheduling in addition
to the use of complex lithic technologies demonstrates
an overall rise in the complexity of lithic technology
and behavioural complexity during this period. Thus,
the MTA could be interpreted as further evidence of
increasing behavioural complexity in the lead up to
the Châtelperronian, as it demonstrates a degree of
innovation and planning depth not identified in earlier
Mousterian industries (Mellars 2004; Soressi 2005).
The second line of evidence derives from the
results of an extensive zooarchaeological analysis
of the faunal remains from 323 Middle Palaeolithic
European sites by Patou-Mathis (2000). Increased diet
breadth and the intensification of resource exploitation in the past have been taken to signify significant
and increasing behavioural complexity (McBrearty
& Brooks 2000; Mellars 2005). If this is the case,
then Patou-Mathis’s conclusions that the number of
archaeological levels where a single species dominates
decreases from OIS 5e to OIS 3 (Oxygen Isotope Stage

Discussion
The cumulative increase in the number and types of
instances demonstrated in our analysis suggests a single, directional increase in the archaeological record of
behavioural complexity among Neanderthals through
time that cannot easily be dismissed as the result of
differential preservation or changing population size.
If this data base were enlarged to include material
from Châtelperronian contexts, this strong upward
trend would no doubt continue past 40,000 years bp,
as these assemblages are well known to contain the
richest complex/symbolic content of all Neanderthal
assemblages (see Coolidge & Wynn 2004; d’Errico et
al. 1998; Hublin et al. 1996; White & Taborin 2000).
If we take Klein’s (1995; 2000; 2001) position that
the increased prevalence of archaeological signatures
of symbolism and complex behaviours reflects an
increase in the efficiency of a population to communicate, and that this improved capacity should effect
the efficiency of other behavioural aspects such as
subsistence and technologies, then we should expect
to see additional evidence of increased behavioural
complexity in other aspects of the Neanderthal
archaeological record. Importantly, the apparent overall rise in archaeological complexity between 40,000
and 60,000 years bp is supported by additional lines of
evidence. One of these is the appearance of the Mousterian of Acheulean Tradition (MTA) in southwestern
France around 50,000 years BP, or within the period
of peak archaeological complexity shown in Figure 2.
The MTA is characterized by small finely retouched
cordiform bifaces, backed elongated flakes and well301

5e and 3) (c. 130,000–60,000 years bp) and that the
frequency of specialized hunts decreases from the
Eemian (c. 130,000–117,000 years bp) to the end of the
Interpleniglacial (c. 45,000–22,000 years bp), could be
interpreted as representing increasing behavioural
complexity among Neanderthal populations throughout Europe. Similarly, Stiner et al. (2000) found that
Neanderthals increasingly exploited smaller game
such as lagomorphs and tortoises in the later part of
the Middle Palaeolithic, particularly after 50,000 years
BP. These studies offer support for the proposition
that Neanderthal behaviour was undergoing changes
toward greater economic and technological flexibility
and complexity, involving increasing rates of innovation and diversification, more complex scheduling of
activities, and an increased level of diversification in
resource exploitation in the final stages of Neanderthal
existence in Europe.
These conclusions founded in technological and
faunal analyses suggest that the overall increase in
complex behaviour presented here may be driven by
broad-based changes in the organization and elaboration of culture leading to cumulative increases in
behavioural complexity. More detailed diachronic
analyses of lithic technology and foraging behaviour
of Neanderthals are required to better understand
the behavioural and technological capabilities of this
species through time.
Whether or not the observed gradual increase
in archaeological indices of behavioural complexity
is a finite reflection of its emergence in Neanderthal
populations, our analysis nonetheless supports the
conclusion reached by d’Errico and others (d’Errico
2003; d’Errico et al. 1998; Zilhão 2006) that by 40,000
years ago Neanderthals already possessed the required
capacity to produce the Châtelperronian independently
of modern humans. The demonstrated increase also
does not rule out the possibility of punctuated periods
of intensified cultural change, as the coarse temporal
resolution of our data and the broad scale at which
we have therefore performed our analysis may well
mask periods of greater or lesser rates of innovation.
Furthermore, sub-division of the data into geographic
regions and comparison against estimates of population
densities may arguably provide further insights into the
nature and rate of spread of innovations throughout the
entire Eurasian Neanderthal population.
Quantitative diachronic analysis of the modern
human archaeological record prior to 40,000 years bp is
essential to better characterize the differences between
the two species. However, direct comparisons of the
magnitude of cognitive and behaviourally complex
expressions will be misleading unless geographic

scales are considered, as modern humans occupied
multiple continents by 45,000 years bp. Since figurative art does not appear until relatively late in the
modern human archaeological record, it is likely
that the majority of archaeological manifestations of
complexity found during the period of Neanderthal
and modern human co-existence will be very similar
in nature. We therefore expect that differences in
the magnitude of symbolic and complex expression
in the archaeological record (and perhaps relative
population size) will be of great importance in better
understanding the cognitive and behavioural differences between these two species.
Conclusion
While the increase in archaeological complexity in
the Neanderthal archaeological record presented
here could be interpreted in different ways, our
central finding is clear — that there was a significant
increase in the archaeological signal of behavioural
complexity and symbolic expression in the lead up
to the Châtelperronian. A great deal more analysis is
required to determine the factors driving this trend
and ultimately to rule out sampling and preservation effects as a potential driving force behind this
chronological pattern.
If this pattern is truly representative of behavioural changes, it may provide the best indication we
have yet that Neanderthals underwent independent
behavioural developments that saw significant, if not
comparable, behavioural evolution to that of our own
species. Indeed it would seem that in some respects
the Châtelperronian represents a logical outcome of
cultural developments that may already have been set
in train among Western European Neanderthals prior
to their extinction. If it can be shown that Neanderthals
had similar cognitive capabilities to our own, then
cognitive inferiority cannot easily be invoked as a key
factor explaining their demise. Cultural advantages of
a linguistic, organizational or technological nature in
competing human populations might be more likely
factors in that case rather than pure cognitive superiority. We do not see the independent development
of complex behaviour among Neanderthals as any
more an ‘impossible coincidence’ (cf. Mellars 2005)
than the multiple independent origins of agriculture.
Furthermore, we have only to look to the widespread
destruction of indigenous cultures by Europeans
in recent times to find parallels for technologically
and organizationally — but not cognitively — more
complex societies rapidly overwhelming indigenous
peoples with usually disastrous effects.
