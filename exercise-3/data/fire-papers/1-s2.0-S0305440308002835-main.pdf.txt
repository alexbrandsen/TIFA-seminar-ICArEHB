A new method of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is applied to the analysis of burned
bones. FTIR analyses were undertaken to examine changes in Crystallinity Index (CI), Ca/P and C/C ratios
in bone experimentally burned to known, but varying, temperatures and durations. Three sample groups
were used to assess the new FTIR method. Blind tests were performed to assess the use of the CI for
predicting burning conditions. The results suggested that the new method of FTIR was preferable to the
traditional approach, but that CI is affected by factors other than temperature of burning, including the
method of FTIR used, and that predictions of burning conditions in archaeological material may not
extend beyond that of ‘high’ or ‘low’ intensity of burning.

1. Introduction
Burned bone forms a signiﬁcant component of many archaeological contexts, yet the subject still lacks much focussed and
cohesive research. The contribution of previous work examining
the visible manifestations of burning, such as colour change (e.g.:
Chandler, 1987; Grévin et al., 1998; Shipman et al., 1984; Stiner
et al., 1995), fracture patterns (e.g.: Buikstra and Swegle, 1989;
Stiner et al., 1995; Thurman and Willmore, 1981) and mechanical
strength (e.g.: Kalsbeek and Richter, 2006; McKinley, 1993, 1994),
for our understanding of heat-induced changes in bone has
recently been brought into question (Thompson, 2005). This is
because these traditional and relatively straightforward foci of
study are actually manifestations of other, more fundamental
changes within the bone. Current work must focus on the application of scientiﬁc techniques to the examination of microstructural osseous changes in a more robustly quantitative manner (e.g.:
Enzo et al., 2007; Hiller et al., 2003; Munro et al., 2007; Rogers and
Daniels, 2002; Thompson and Chudek, 2007). Such studies have
provided much more information regarding the changes to the
crystal and elemental structure of bone during the process of
burning, and it is these changes (dubbed primary-level changes;
Thompson, 2004) that have been shown statistically to provide the

greatest chance of predicting the speciﬁcs of the archaeological
burning event (such as, temperature of ﬁre, duration of burning,
etc.) from the remains themselves (Thompson, 2005). One such
quantitative method has been the application of the Crystallinity
Index.
The Crystallinity Index (CI), or ‘splitting factor’, is a measure of
the order of the crystal structure and composition within bone
(Stiner et al., 2001). The CI values in modern unaltered bone typically lie around 2.50–3.25, but will increase as crystal structure
becomes more ordered (Munro et al., 2007; Nagy et al., 2008;
Nielsen-Marsh and Hedges, 1999; Shipman et al., 1984; Stiner et al.,
2001; Trueman et al., 2008). The crystal structure of bone can be
seen to alter very slowly towards a more ordered composition with
an associated increase in overall crystal size following death
(Bartsiokas and Middleton, 1992; Munro et al., 2007; Olsen et al.,
2008; Surovell and Stiner, 2001). The speed of this increase in
crystal order can also be increased by weathering conditions (Stiner
et al., 2001). Changes in bone porosity resulting from various other
diagenetic pathways have also been associated with changes to CI
(Nielsen-Marsh and Hedges, 1999), as has degree of organic content
within the bone (Trueman et al., 2008). The CI is calculated by
measuring the ratio of speciﬁc spectra peaks (discussed in more
detail below), and changes to this ratio indicate a change in peak
sharpness. Signiﬁcantly these changes in CI have been shown to be
the direct result of burning (Person et al., 1996; Stiner et al., 2001). It
is argued that the heat-induced increase in CI is primarily the result
of loss of the protective organic phase and structural carbonate

T.J.U. Thompson et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 36 (2009) 910–914

(Person et al., 1996). CI has not been applied extensively in the
literature, but it nonetheless has been argued to demonstrate good
reproducibility of results (Person et al., 1996) and does seem to hold
great potential for archaeological study, particularly for those
attempting to distinguish between burned and non-burned bones
(such as in Enzo et al., 2007; Shahack-Gross et al., 1997; Sillen and
Hoering, 1993) – although it is not discriminating enough to
distinguish boiled remains (Koon et al., 2003). Initial work began to
assess the potential of the CI in burned bone studies in the 1990s,
but its use tailed off (presumably as a result of its high technical
requirements) until more recently, where it can be seen incorporated into studies alongside other quantitative methods. To date,
the key problems with the CI have been (a) distinguishing between
changes in the index due to burning and due to normal bone
diagenesis (Bartsiokas and Middleton, 1992; Trueman et al., 2008 –
although these are likely over the tens of millennia timescale), and
that (b) it is an entirely arbitrary numerical construction (Piga et al.,
2008).
The Crystallinity Index can be measured using X-ray Diffraction
(XRD) or Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Both have
been applied in the literature, with the former technique being
marginally more popular. Here, we have used the FTIR approach in
the mid-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum, nominally
the region from 4000 to 400 cm1. One of the great advantages of
infrared spectroscopy is that virtually any sample in any state may
be studied – this is of great relevance considering the varying
preservational and diagenetic state of archaeological human
remains. Infrared spectroscopy is a technique based on the vibrations of bonds within a molecule. An infrared spectrum is
commonly obtained by passing infrared radiation through a sample
and determining what fraction of the incident radiation is absorbed
at a particular wavelength. The wavelength at which any peak in an
absorption spectrum appears corresponds to the frequency of
vibration of a speciﬁc part of a molecule.
FTIR analysis of solid phase samples can be typically performed
using two different methodologies. The ﬁrst, more traditional and
widely used approach, FTIR–KBr, utilises a pellet of potassium
bromide (KBr) which is transparent in the mid-infrared region, as
a support medium for the sample. The mixture is usually ground
with an agate mortar and pestle and subjected to a pressure of about
10 tonne in an evacuated die. This sinters the mixture and produces
a clear transparent disc, which is then placed in the sample chamber
of the spectrometer for direct absorption measurements. More
details can be found in the likes of Stuart (2004).
The second, more recent approach is termed FTIR–ATR. This
utilises an attenuated total reﬂection (ATR) accessory which operates by measuring the changes that occur in a totally internally
reﬂected infrared beam when the beam comes into contact with
a sample. An infrared beam is directed onto an optically dense
crystal with a high refractive index at an angle greater than the
critical angle for total internal reﬂection. This internal reﬂectance
creates an evanescent wave that extends beyond the surface of the
crystal into the sample held in contact with the crystal. This
evanescent wave protrudes only a few microns beyond the crystal
surface and into the sample. Consequently, there must be good
contact between the sample and the crystal surface. In regions of
the infrared spectrum where the sample absorbs energy, the
evanescent wave will be attenuated or altered. FTIR–KBr has been
used successfully in previous burned bone work (such as Munro
et al., 2007; Olsen et al., 2008; Shahack-Gross et al., 1997). None of
the previous burned bone studies appear to have utilised FTIR–ATR
(although it has been used recently by Stathopoulou et al. (2008)
for studying diagenetic bone). FTIR–ATR has advantages over FTIR–
KBr in that sample preparation is quicker and less messy, userto-user spectra variation is minimised and the impact of
sample preparation on results is reduced (see Surovell and Stiner,

911

2001 for illustration). To date, there has been no comparison of the
result produced by these two different approaches.
The use of FTIR also allows for the examination of other indices.
For example, the carbonate to phosphate ratio (C/P) has been
exploited in the study of burned bone (Olsen et al., 2008; Zapata
et al., 2006) – the value decreases as a result of burning – as has the
carbon/nitrogen ratio (Sillen and Hoering, 1993); while the
carbonyl to carbonate ratio (C/C) should also be able to provide
information regarding the structural composition of burned bone.
There were two main aims to this research: (i) to compare the
use of the two FTIR techniques: FTIR–ATR and FTIR–KBr with
regards to obtaining CI, C/P and C/C ratios of burned bone, and (ii) to
attempt a blind test to see if the CI, C/P ratio and C/C ratios could
accurately predict the temperature of burning.
2. Method and materials
2.1. Osteological samples
Three sets of bone samples were used in this research. All
samples were of modern sheep long bones burned in an electric
mufﬂe furnace to known temperatures for speciﬁc periods of
time following the protocol adopted in Hiller et al. (2003),
Thompson (2004, 2005) and Thompson and Chudek (2007). Bone
samples were heated to 500  C, 700  C and 900  C and maintained at these temperatures for 15 or 45 min. Following this
duration, the bones were removed from the furnace and allowed
to cool naturally. Bones were heated in batches, so all of those
heated to 500  C for 15 min, etc. were done so simultaneously.
Here, these temperatures were adopted to allow direct comparison with previous work (variability in burning methodology is
a serious limiting and complicating factor in burned bone
research), although in the original publications these temperatures were selected as they covered the range of temperatures
where considerable heat-induced osseous change was likely.
Sample 1 was used to calculate the initial CI, C/P and C/C values
for both FTIR–ATR and FTIR–KBr. Sample 2 was introduced to
clarify some of the potential methodological issues raised during
the analysis of Sample 1 (discussed below). Sample 3 was used
for the blind testing of the CI values.
2.2. FTIR
Representative fractions from the periosteal surface of the
diaphysis of each bone were collected and ground with an agate
mortar and pestle. For the FTIR–ATR method, automatic software
correction of the spectra accounted for the variation of depth of
penetration with wavelength. The ATR accessory used a diamond
crystal which had an operational range from 30,000 to 200 cm1.
For the FTIR–KBr discs, 1–3 mg of ground bone was mixed with
around 100 mg of KBr and a pellet was prepared using a press.
These FTIR spectra were obtained using a Nicolet 5700 FTIR Spectrometer controlled by OMNICÔ software. An expanded spectrum
in the 2000–400 cm1 range was used for measuring several factors
with a spectral resolution of 4 cm1. Each spectrum was the result
of an average of 16 scans.
2.3. Crystallinity Index
The crystallinity is a function of the extent of splitting of the two
absorption bands at 605 and 565 cm1 (Olsen et al., 2008). CI was
calculated according to Weiner and Bar-Yosef (1990) and Stiner
et al. (1995) and as used in Nagy et al. (2008). For a baseline corrected spectrum the heights of the absorptions were added and
then divided by the height of the minimum between them (Nagy
et al., 2008; Stiner et al., 1995).

912

2.4. C/P
IR spectra of the bio-apatite bone fraction are represented by
vibration band of mainly CO3 and PO4 giving absorption peaks at
710, 874 and 1415 cm1 and 565, 605 and 1035 cm1 respectively.
The carbonate absorption peak at 710 cm1 is characteristic of
CaCO3 and can therefore be used to detect absorbed CaCO3
contaminants. As the absorption peak height at 1415 cm1 and
1035 cm1 is proportional to the content of carbonate and phosphate, the carbonate content of the samples was estimated by the
C/P ratio given as C/P ¼ A1415/A1035 (Olsen et al., 2008). A new
background was created for each run.
2.5. C/C
Changes in the C/C ratio, which is the ratio between the carbonyl
(CO) peak (1455) and the CO3 peak (1415) are also expected. This
provides information on the ratio of organic to inorganic material
present in the bone. The CO peak arises from the amide group
present in collagen, which will begin to decompose at elevated
temperatures.
2.6. Blind testing
One of the arguments put forward for the use of CI is that it
could provide evidence for the occurrence of burning. Beyond that,
it may indicate the intensity of burning. We tested 10 samples of
bone (each was sampled four times) using both FTIR methods. The
bones were burned by TJUT, but the details of each were unknown
to the FTIR operator (MG) until after the experiments. The
temperature predictions were based on the regression equations
created from Sample 2. As with Person et al. (1996) and Surovell
and Stiner (2001) the relationship was non-linear.
3. Results
Table 1 displays the changes in CI as a result of temperature and
duration of burning, in addition to FTIR methodology. Surovell and
Stiner (2001) have previously demonstrated that methodological
practice and sample preparation can have an impact on CI values. It
can be seen here that FTIR technique is just as important in terms of
the actual CI values. Fig. 1a and b, however, shows that the overall
trend in CI remains constant regardless of FTIR method adopted
(that is, CI increases with burning intensity).
During the analysis of Sample 1, it became clear that there were
unexpected differences between the CI values for each bone
section. To calculate CI with Sample 1, each bone was sampled three
times; however the results often varied considerably and by more
than would be reasonably expected. This was assumed to
result from methodological issues; therefore a second, larger
sample (of 18) was analysed whilst applying more stringent

controls to the collection of background spectra. These results are
presented in Table 2.
Table 3 and Fig. 3 present the results of the blind testing. This
was attempted in order to determine the usefulness of CI as
a means of providing more information than simply burned or
unburned. As can be seen, with the exception of Samples 1 and 10,
the accuracy of our prediction equations is poor. At its worst,
a difference of w400  C is recorded. Mostly the differences are
between 100 and 200  C. The predictions from the FTIR–ATR
method are marginally more accurate.
4. Discussion
There is an unfortunate lack of comparable data in the literature
(i.e., of known temperature burnings); however our FTIR–KBr CI
values (Table 2) do compare reasonably well with Munro et al.,
(2007). Unfortunately it is not possible to compare the CI calculated
using FTIR to that created using XRD (of which there is more data
published). This is because of the methodological differences
between the two, principally that FTIR is based on an area averaging approach while XRD is based on a volume averaging method
(Rogers and Daniels, 2002). These differences even result in the
creation of slightly different spectra for the same samples of bone
(as in Chakraborty et al., 2006).

Both Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate that there are differences in the
CI values produced using the different FTIR approaches. Fig. 2
highlights these differences with the spectra themselves. With both
sample groups, FTIR–KBr produces lower CI values. It can also be
seen that the larger sample size in Table 2 has greatly reduced the
average CI values. We should be able to have more conﬁdence in the
results in Table 2, as they beneﬁt from a larger sample size and
greater control of the background spectra. However, extensive
intra-bone variation can be seen in each (as evident from the
general increase in standard deviations compared to Table 1). It is
therefore clear that the sampling protocol used is critical, and that
different sections of any one burned bone will produce different CI
values. This has been suggested as a theoretical problem by Surovell
and Stiner (2001), and has clear implications for the comparison of
CI values within and between research projects. It may be possible
to reduce this effect by using colour as an indicator of degree of
heat-induced decomposition, therefore ensuring that similar coloured sections of bones are compared with each other.
Fig. 2a and b shows typical spectra curves for low and high
intensity burnings. Spectra for all burning intensities are not

from the curves – mathematical calculations are required. Nonetheless, broadly it can be said that at 500  C the peak of CO and CO3
are clearly visible, but that they reduce in intensity at higher
temperatures. This is due to the decomposition of the collagen with
the increase of the temperature. Furthermore, the two peaks of
phosphate at 565 and 605 cm1 become more clearly resolved at
900  C. In addition, a third peak appears in this area due to the
decomposition of phosphate. It can also be seen that the peak at
1035 cm1 becomes narrower at 900  C. These changes are
signiﬁcant in terms of calculating the C/P and C/C ratios. For
example, the loss of the collagen at higher temperatures limits the
use of the C/C ratio above 700  C. Person et al. (1996) have previously discussed the signiﬁcance of the loss of carbon due to
burning, while a number of studies have discussed the signiﬁcance
of the physico-chemical changes within bone at this temperature
(such as Shipman et al., 1984 or more recently Hiller et al., 2003 and
Thompson, 2005). Key is the mobilisation of the inorganic faction
resulting in crystal rearrangement and restructuring. Fig. 3a and
b shows the results of the C/P and C/C calculations. The two
methods of FTIR produce similar values for C/P, with mostly overlapping error margins. The normal C/P ratio is around 0.31–0.65
(Nagy et al., 2008). In Fig. 3a it can be seen to decrease with
increased burning intensity and is thus in keeping with previous
studies (e.g.: Olsen et al., 2008). The trend of the C/C ratio differs
from that of the C/P ratio (Fig. 3b). The relatively linear trends of
both ratios suggest that, although it may not be possible to determine speciﬁc burning temperatures from such ratios, general
conclusions about high or low intensity burnings can be ascertained. At the very least, the disappearance of the collagen peak
over 700  C is highly diagnostic.
Although the data presented in Table 3 and Fig. 4 suggest that CI
should not be used as a means of predicting temperature of
burning, it should be noted that accuracy could be increased with
increased sample sizes (although Table 2 highlights that this is not
so straightforward). Furthermore, it could be argued that the use of
CI can still be utilised as an indicator of high or low intensity
burning, and it is this level of precision that is recommended here.
Care must still be taken in the interpretation of this, as the crystal
evidence of low intensity burning may be confused with normal
diagenetic change (Sillen and Hoering, 1993).
The results of this work demonstrate that the FTIR–ATR method
of analysis is a preferred alternative to the traditional FTIR–KBr

method. Sampling is quicker and cleaner, it is methodologically
simpler and reduces operator error, and the results of the blind tests
suggest that it is as accurate as the traditional method of analysis.
The disadvantages (that the sample must be strongly absorbing, and
spectral corrections need to be made to account for the variation of
penetration depth with wavelength) are small in comparison to the
key beneﬁts. Tables 1–3 show that there are differences in the
absolute values between the results of the two methods of FTIR, but
the variation with temperature is almost the same. Although
a degree of caution is recommended when making comparisons
between results obtained from the two different methods, the
similar trends produced and the results in Fig. 4 show that calibration will negate this initial concern and will result in FTIR–ATR being
the preferred method of analysis in the study of burned bone.
5. Conclusions
The results and discussion here suggest four key conclusions: (1)
that CI is greatly inﬂuenced by the region of bone that the sample
originates; (2) that CI is inﬂuenced by method of FTIR used, and can
be reliably measured by FTIR–ATR; (3) that CI might stabilise
around the 700  C burning point (again, signiﬁcant as much
structural change occurs here); and (4) that FTIR can distinguish
non-burned from low intensity and high intensity burnings.
Although it is clear that the Crystallinity Index can make a useful
contribution to the study and interpretation of burned bones from
archaeological contexts, these above considerations must be borne
in mind if one is to avoid misinterpreting the osteological data.
