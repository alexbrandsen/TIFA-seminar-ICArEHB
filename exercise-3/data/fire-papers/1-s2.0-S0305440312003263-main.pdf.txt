The crystallinity of bone mineral represents an established method of measuring heat-induced change
and is of importance to ﬁelds including material science, clinical science, anthropology and archaeology.
A commonly used technique involves the calculation of the Crystallinity Index (CI) using selected peaks
from Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) absorbance spectra. However, the choice of peaks has to date not
been statistically justiﬁed. In this study a novel application of statistical techniques to the FTIR spectra of
bone samples burned in the range 100  Ce1100  C has been used to identify 5 new spectral indices of
heat-induced crystallinity change. The validity of the new indices was tested by using a statistical
classiﬁcation model (LDA) to predict the burning temperature of a set of 108 bone samples burned
between 100  C and 1100  C. A correct classiﬁcation rate (CCR) of 97.2% was obtained when
a combination of 4 indices including the CI was used. This was signiﬁcantly better than the CCR of
66.7% which was obtained when the CI was used on its own.

1. Introduction
1.1. Analysis of bone material
Bone mineral is a signiﬁcant biomaterial with a range of uses
across a number of disciplines. Understanding its physical and
chemical properties is important for allowing researchers and
practitioners to fully exploit this vital material. However, since bone
is a complex heterogeneous material, analysis of these properties
becomes somewhat problematic. As a material, it has both organic
(largely collagen) and inorganic (largely calcium phosphate)
constituents and macroscopically a typical bone is comprised of
several different layers (the periosteum, cortical bone, and endosteum) and different bone types (compact and cancellous). Microscopically, the mineral phase, which accounts for 60e70 weight%
(Wang et al., 2010) can be referred to as an impure, nonstoichiometric and poorly crystalline form of hydroxyapatite, with
a basic nano-sized apatite structure of Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 (D’Elia et al.,
2007; Etok et al., 2007; Mkukuma et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2010). A
number of different factors can alter this mineral composition and
this in turn will affect its usefulness, regardless of the speciﬁc
context of application.

One of the more signiﬁcant changes to the structure and
composition of bone occurs when this material is heated. Heated
bone is one of the most challenging osteological materials to study,
since the process of heating produces a range of complicated
changes within the material. Thompson (2004) has summarised
these heat-induced transformations as Dehydration (loss of water
between 100 and 600  C), Decomposition (loss of the organic
component, 300e800  C), Inversion (alteration of the inorganic
phase, 500e1100  C) and Fusion (coalescence of the crystal structure, 700  Cþ). Later work by Etok et al. (2007) provided more
speciﬁcity, by noting that (1) the loss of water between 25 and
250  C was from two sources, the loosely bound water up to 100  C
and then the water structurally within proteins and bound to the
mineral beyond; (2) that the loss of the organic component
between 300 and 500  C resulted in 50e55% loss of mass, an
increase in mean crystallite size from 10 nm to 30 nm, an increase
in crystal thickness from 2 nm to 9 nm and the formation of new
mineral phases, and; (3) that above 500  C the remaining residual
organic matter is lost, mean crystallite size increases and levels off
at 110 nm at 800  C, crystal thickness increases to 10 nm, and that
by 900  C the porous texture formed by the previous losses is
altered to produce a closely interlocking texture. Part of the reason
for the delayed alteration of the mineral phase during heating
relates back to the heterogeneous nature of bone, as the organic
matrix provides a ‘thermal shielding effect’ that protects the inorganic component, and it is not until this is lost that the mineral

T.J.U. Thompson et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 40 (2013) 416e422

surfaces are fully exposed to the heating process (Etok et al., 2007;
Lebon et al., 2010; Person et al., 1996; Trueman et al., 2008).
It has been argued and demonstrated both experimentally and
statistically that the most appropriate scale to study heat-induced
change in bone is at the microscopic scale (Thompson, 2004,
2005). In addition it is thought that changes at this microscopic
level can be viewed as being more robust than those more apparent
macroscopic changes. For example, change in colour is often used
to comment on burning pathways, but this is inﬂuenced by a range
of variables to the extent that associating it strongly with any one of
them is inadvisable (Thompson, 2005). At this microscopic scale,
there are two key features inﬂuenced by heating that are worth
exploring: changes to the elemental composition and changes to
the crystalline structure of the bone. Although changes to the
elemental composition of bone have been successfully used to
examine heat-induced change (e.g.: Bergslien et al., 2008; Schurr
and Hayes, 2008), more information is known generally about the
structure of bone than the elemental composition, and therefore it
makes most sense to focus efforts here at this current time.
In addition, understanding and manipulating heat-induced
changes to the crystalline structure of bone is important for
a number of reasons. Clinically to ensure that biomaterials to be
placed within the body have a similar crystalline structure to
natural bone (Nakano et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2010), and to
understand the nature of pathologies and diseases (Mkukuma et al.,
2004). Within the material sciences, crystallinity is related to
solubility (Nakano et al., 2002). Heating the biomaterial is one way
to inﬂuence the degree of bone mineral crystallinity. More generally an understanding of the inﬂuence of heating on crystallinity
can be important for understanding diet, hunting practices and
funerary custom within archaeological contexts (Schiegl et al.,
2003; Squires et al., 2011; Thompson et al., 2011) or for determining whether criminal activity has occurred and to aid in the
identiﬁcation process in forensic scenarios (Thompson, 2004,
2005). Note that other techniques such as mechanical grinding can
also be used to inﬂuence bone mineral crystallinity (Nakano et al.,
2002; Surovell and Stiner, 2001).
1.2. Crystallinity index
One method that has been used to study such changes in bone
microstructure is the Crystallinity Index (CI). The CI is a measure of
the crystal order, strain and organisation in bone. When bone is
fresh, the crystal structure is poorly crystalline (Paschalis et al.,
1997; Thompson et al., 2011), partly as a result of carbonate
substitution causing crystal disorder (Wang et al., 2010). Crystallinity is not uniform throughout the skeleton, and it varies between
the different mineralised tissues of the human body (Nakano et al.,
2002), while age has also been shown to have an inﬂuence on
crystallinity, with younger bone being less crystalline than more
mature bone (Paschalis et al., 1997). There are also species differences in bone mineral crystallinity, although some of these relate
more to differences in the proportion of organic material within the
rather than species difference per se (Mkukuma et al., 2004).
As a result of heating and burning, the crystal structure of bone
becomes better ordered and characterised by larger crystals and
less strain, and as such the value for the CI increases. This increase
in crystallinity is the result of larger equidimensional crystals and
a resulting reduction in microstrain (Etok et al., 2007).
CI has been used to study heated bone mineral in a number of
contexts. Thompson et al. (2011) have provided a review of its use
in bioarchaeology, but examples include the use of crystallinity to
determine whether bone was burned or not (Piga et al., 2008a;
Pijoan et al., 2007; Schiegl et al., 2003; Shahack-Gross et al., 1997)
and to allow for differences in funerary practice to be noted

417

(Squires et al., 2011). In addition, a number of works have explored
the potential of the CI as a proxy of bone quality and thus as
a method to apply to degraded bone before application of more
expensive and complicated biomolecular or dating techniques
(Brock et al., 2010; D’Elia et al., 2007; Lebon et al., 2010; Misner
et al., 2009; Pucéat et al., 2004; Schwarz et al., 2009; Trueman
et al., 2008).
The CI can be calculated using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman Spectroscopy,
although the speciﬁc calculations and values will differ between
the three. As a result, CI values from the three methods are not
directly comparable, although the general trends are similar. There
are merits to all of these techniques, but FTIR allows for simultaneous examination of all tissue components within bone, permits
identiﬁcation of contaminant material, allows for the detection of
substitutions within the elemental structure, is cheaper and is more
accurate at lower heating temperatures (D’Elia et al., 2007; Munro
et al., 2007; Paschalis et al., 1997; Weiner et al., 1993; Wright and
Schwarcz, 1996). Note that other workers advocate XRD over
infrared spectroscopy (e.g.: Pijoan et al., 2007; Pucéat et al., 2004;
Rogers et al., 2010), and that attempts have been made to calibrate
the different methodologies (Munro et al., 2007; Pucéat et al.,
2004).
In order to calculate the CI using FTIR methods the following
formulae is used:

CI ¼



565 cm1 þ 605 cm1

.
595 cm1

where each of the values is the absorbance at a given wavelength.
The 565 cm1 and 605 cm1 wavelengths correspond to bending
vibration bands of phosphate (see Table 1) and both increase with
increased crystallinity. The 595 cm1 wavelength will decrease thus
causing an overall increase in CI value. Note that although increased
temperature of heating causes an increase in CI, the relationship is
non-linear. A baseline correction is also often used, normally made
between 750 and 450 cm1. This formula was ﬁrst proposed by
Shemesh (1990) and Weiner and Bar-Yosef (1990) and has been
routinely used since, although other workers have used different
indices as a Crystallinity Index (Álvarez-Lloret et al., 2006; Farley
et al., 2010). This is not to say that other peaks along the spectra
have not been used: for example, Lebon et al. (2010) examined the
1060/1075 ratio and the position of the v1 PO4 position while
Álvarez-Lloret et al. (2006) and Farley et al. (2010) have explored
the potential of a number of peaks along the spectra. Table 1

summarises the origin and causes of speciﬁc peaks along the FTIR
spectra from bone.
Signiﬁcantly however, despite the general acceptance of the CI,
there is little justiﬁcation for the use of this speciﬁc ratio. Indeed,
Piga et al. (2008b) argue that the CI is a completely arbitrary ratio.
Recent debate on the use of CI on bone mineral has focussed on
methodological and sampling issues (Thompson et al., 2011;
Surovell and Stiner, 2001) rather than the validity of the index itself.
This is not an acceptable situation if it is to be exploited fully in the
clinical, engineering or anthropological contexts.
The aim of this research is therefore to examine the full spectra
produced from FTIR analysis of bone mineral in order to determine
the most appropriate ratios for analysing the effect of heating and
burning.
2. Materials and method
2.1. Analysis of bone mineral
This research utilised the FTIR method of determining bone
crystallinity, and speciﬁcally the Attenuated Total Reﬂectance (ATR)
approach. Of the two methods of FTIR analysis (ATR or potassium
bromide pellets) this has been shown to be the preferred method
for bone mineral due to the range of methodological considerations
associated with the more traditional potassium bromide (KBr)
approach (Stathopoulou et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2009).
Modern unburned sheep rib bone were cleaned and macerated
(in warm water) in order to remove the soft tissue from the bone
surface. A scalpel was used to remove any residual pieces on the
bone. The bones were heated in an electric mufﬂe furnace. The
bones were burned for 45 min at 100  C temperature intervals from
100  C to 1100  C, in accordance to the heating method laid out in
Hiller et al. (2003), Thompson (2005) and Thompson et al. (2009,
2011) and to ensure that the range of temperatures expected in the
ﬁeld are considered. Once the bones had cooled down, small
samples of bone were scraped off the external side of the ribs. These
samples were then placed on the FTIR-ATR. For each temperature 9
separate samples were measured (108 in total). From the spectra
produced, the CI was calculated as described above. The C/P ratio
(1415 cm1/1035 cm1) was also calculated since it focuses on the
changes to the carbonate and a number of studies have utilised it in
combination with CI (Koon et al., 2003; Olsen et al., 2008; Squires
et al., 2011; Thompson et al., 2009, 2011; Wright and Schwarcz,
1996). Note that as with the CI, its use is not necessarily statistically justiﬁed.
2.2. The statistical analysis of FTIR spectra
In order to determine the most useful regions of the spectra in
terms of heat-induced mineral change, the variance across the
spectral dataset was examined. Analysis of variance along the
spectra produced from these samples consisted of dividing the
variance between all of the groups by the sum of the variance for
each group, using spectra normalised to the strongest phosphate
absorption at 1035 cm1. Each group consisted of the 9 sample
spectra recorded for each temperature. Following examination of
the variance in the spectra, it was possible to construct a number of
ratios which directly related to the signiﬁcant heat-induced
changes seen in the data. Ratios of two wavelengths were chosen
rather than the use of a single wavelength as ratios can reduce the
effect of spectral baseline shifts and variation in absolute absorbance values.
The new ratios produced from the FTIR analysis required user
input but their choice was subsequently statistically interrogated
using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA allows one to draw

conclusions about the strength of relationships within complex
series of data, and has been used previously to understand heatinduced changes in bone (Thompson, 2004, 2005). PCA was used
here to identify the key relationships which best explained the
variation seen in this heated bone mineral data. Two PCA calculations were made, one to examine the spectra and one the crystallinity measures.
Finally, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was performed. A
key feature of LDA is that it allows the creation of a statistical
classiﬁcation model based on a so-called ‘training’ dataset. This
then allows a test dataset to be independently classiﬁed without
user input. LDA aims to ﬁnd N  1 discriminant functions, which
maximise the separation among N objects. Each discriminant
function is a combination of variables selected as features. LDA is
similar to PCA in the sense that they both create new latent variables from the original variables (in this case, wavelength).
However each time the PCA is calculated, the mean value has to be
subtracted along each variable, which makes it difﬁcult to introduce new objects for classiﬁcation. LDA forms latent variables only
from the normalized original variables, and any new objects
inputted can be classiﬁed based on the discriminant functions. Thus
in the case of this work, it would be possible to predict the
temperature of burning of a bone sample by determining the
distance of its given values to those already plotted. LDA has been
used previously to analyse similar spectral data, albeit not from
bone (Li et al., 2011; Thanasoulias et al., 2003). PCA and LDA
calculations were performed using Minitab 15 (Mintab Inc, USA).
In order to assess the accuracy and precision of our new
measures, we burned a second set of modern animal rib bones and
then used our LDA models to predict the temperature at which
these bones had been burned at. High accuracy in this test would
imply that our measures were describing the variation in heatinduced change well.
3. Results
The average spectra for the heated bone samples are displayed
in Fig. 1. Changes due to temperature can clearly be seen, but from
Fig. 2 the wavelengths which display the most variation during the
whole heating range are established. Note that in Fig. 2 the lack of
variation at circa 1000 cm1 is due to the spectra being normalised
at that point. Nonetheless when all temperature-related changes
are examined, the region from 1300 cm1 to 1650 cm1 shows
more heat-induced activity than the region below 1000 cm1. Fig. 2
allows for the construction of ﬁve new measures which speciﬁcally
target areas of heat-induced activity. These new measures are still
partly determined by eye, but their basis is at least more closely
associated to heat-induced changes across the spectra. Thus the
new measures are:

CO=P ¼ 1650 cm1 =1035 cm1
CO=CO3 ¼ 1650 cm1 =1415 cm1
CO3 =P ¼ 900 cm1 =1035 cm1
Phosphate High Temperature ðPHTÞ ¼ 625 cm1 =610 cm1
Line width ¼ the full width at half maximum of the
phosphate peak at 1035 cm1
The results of these ﬁve new measures in addition to the
traditional CI and C/P for the experimentally burned bone samples
are shown in Table 2. As can be seen CI and C/P display the trends

reported elsewhere (e.g.: Thompson et al., 2009, 2011) whereby CI
increases with increasing burning temperature and C/P decreases
with increasing temperature. Note with CI how the value increases
up to a peak at 800  C but then decreases slightly. This feature is not
widely reported because few studies burn bone to these higher
temperatures. CO/P also decreases with increasing temperature but
more sharply than C/P. CO/CO3, CO3/P, PHT and line width all have
ﬂuctuating relationships with temperature. Note also that there are
no values for CO/CO3 at 1000  C and 1100  C because these peaks
disappear at this point. Likewise there are no values for PHT until
700  C because the peak of concern does not appear until this point.
Following the application of these seven ratios, PCA was utilised
in order to determine which of these ratios are affected by similar
variables and which show signiﬁcant difference across the burning

regime. PCA results based upon a comparison of the spectra and
a comparison of results of our seven measures revealed that there
were relationships between the low temperature burning results
(<400  C), middle temperature results (400e700  C) and high
temperature results (>700  C). The PCA has also shown that
different ratios are more appropriate for these three ranges. Low
temperature changes were best described by C/P, CO/CO3, CO3/P,
CO/P and line width; middle temperature ranges by CI and line
width, and; high temperature ranges by PHT and C/P.
The results of the seven ratios when applied to the second set of
burned bone are displayed in Table 3. As can be seen, the ratios
produced results comparable to the ﬁrst set of experimentally
burned bone (Table 2). Table 4 shows the results of the prediction of
burning temperature using LDA. Note that the ratios used (CI, C/P,

CO/CO3 and line width) were those found previously by PCA to best
describe the variables causing heat-induced changes across all
three burning intensities. As can be seen of the 108 test samples,
104 were correctly attributed to temperature of burning. That is
a correct classiﬁcation rate of 97.2%. As a comparison, Table 4 also
includes results of the prediction model based solely on the CI ratio.
As can be seen, the traditional ratio does not perform as well
(66.7%) as the combination of our new ratios. It can also be seen
that, as mentioned above, CI is most accurate at medium burning
intensities.

which are even more useful. However, the accuracy of the subsequent predictions should allay any concerns in this matter.
The application of PCA and LDA to the FTIR spectra and subsequent indices allows for greater interpretation of heat-induced
change in bone mineral. PCA alone allows for the associations
between individual ratios to be examined permitting us to identify
measures which are further apart in variance space and thus
examining different heat-induced phenomena, to be chosen. The
fact that the PCA produced three general clusters (at low, medium
and high temperatures) does not come as a surprise. These three
phases largely correspond to key heat-induced transformations
within the bone mineral, namely the initial loss of water and
organic content, activity of the crystal structure, and remodelling of
the microscopic structure (as detailed by Etok et al., 2007;
Thompson, 2004). Indeed it is suggested that workers should move
away from the singular use of temperature, but instead focus on
intensity of heating in order to include other pertinent variables
(such as duration). The three intensities proposed map onto the
three statistically-derived ones here. Likewise it should not be
a surprise that different measures best describe different temperature ranges since they are examining different points in the FTIR
spectra, and therefore different compounds which will react
differently to the heating process. What is of note is that the CI is
most appropriate for the middle range and lacks some speciﬁcity at
either heating extremes. Koon et al. (2003) have already noted that
CI can be a poor indicator of low temperature change, which our
data also supports. In many ways CI could be seen as an ‘average’
measure of heat-induced mineral change.
Following identiﬁcation of the measures which describe most
variation in the bone mineral, these can be tested using a new
sample of burned bone and utilisation of LDA. The accuracy of CI has
been tested before, but this tends to be in the form of blind studies
(such as Thompson et al., 2009). This becomes signiﬁcantly more
complicated once multiple measures are being used, and thus is

4. Discussion
The power of this approach to the examination of the FTIR
spectra is that it ﬁnally allows workers to statistically assess the
most useful parts of the spectra to study, rather than just use
traditional methods. The CI makes sense from an osteological
perspective, but it is difﬁcult to determine whether the three
wavelengths on the spectra that are used are the most informative
in relation to the heating of bone mineral. Lebon et al. (2010) have
demonstrated that there are actually a range of points and ratios
stretching along the length of the spectra that all provide different
and complementary information regarding the heating process, but
this was not statistically interrogated. Fig. 2 which is based on
statistical analysis of the variance across and between the heatinduced spectra has demonstrated the key regions of the spectra
to focus on. Despite the continuous use of the CI (which is understandable considering its ease of use and proven success in the
literature) there are other regions of the spectra which vary more
during heating, and signiﬁcantly, during different stages of the
heating process. The analysis of variance allows identiﬁcation of
regions with the biggest change and then selection of appropriate
ratios. One potential weakness of this study is that the ﬁve new
measures were still selected by hand, and there may be other ratios

only achievable through the use of statistical methods. By selecting
four ratios (CI, C/P, CO/CO3 and Line width) a correct classiﬁcation
rate of 97.2% is obtained. Naturally removal of individual ratios
worsens the correct classiﬁcation rate, while CI on its own gives
a rate of 66.7% (which is higher than the 20% rate noted previously
by Thompson et al., 2009).
5. Conclusions
The key strength of the approach presented here is that it does
not make the assumption that the CI is the most appropriate ratio to
use for examining microscopic heat-induced structural change in
bone mineral. Indeed, as can be seen, there are a number of ratios
which, when used in combination, can provide extremely valuable
information regarding the conditions of heating and crystallinity
which were not previously available. The new measures allow a far
better classiﬁcation to be achieved, yet it is still possible that there
are other ratios which may improve matters further. Since it is not
possible to calculate the Crystallinity Index using FTIR without
recording the full spectra of infrared absorption, there is little
argument for not including our additional ratios in subsequent
analysis of bone mineral crystalline structure, since they permit
signiﬁcantly more information for researchers working in a variety
of contexts.
