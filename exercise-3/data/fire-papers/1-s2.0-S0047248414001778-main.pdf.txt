The use of ﬁre is central to human survival and to the processes of becoming human. The earliest evidence for hominin use of ﬁre dates to more than a million years ago. However, only when ﬁre use became
a regular part of human behavioral adaptations could its beneﬁts be fully realized and its evolutionary
consequences fully expressed. It remains an open question when the use of ﬁre shifted from occasional
and opportunistic to habitual and planned. Understanding the time frame of this 'technological mutation'
will help explain aspects of our anatomical evolution and encephalization over the last million years. It
will also provide an important perspective on hominin dispersals out of Africa and the colonization of
temperate environments, as well as the origins of social developments such as the formation of provisioned base camps. Frequencies of burnt ﬂints from a 16-m-deep sequence of archaeological deposits at
Tabun Cave, Israel, together with data from the broader Levantine archaeological record, demonstrate
that regular or habitual ﬁre use developed in the region between 350,000e320,000 years ago. While
hominins may have used ﬁre occasionally, perhaps opportunistically, for some million years, we argue
here that it only became a consistent element in behavioral adaptations during the second part of the
Middle Pleistocene.

Introduction
The available archaeological record shows that evidence for the
use of ﬁre, whether well-controlled or not, is highly sporadic for
most of the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 million-250 kya [thousands of years ago]) (e.g., Alperson-Aﬁl and Goren-Inbar, 2010;
Berna et al., 2012; Gowlett and Wrangham, 2013) with some evidence for intensiﬁcation at ca. 300e400 kya (e.g., Rolland, 2004;
de Lumley, 2006; Karkanas et al., 2007; Roebroeks and Villa, 2011).
In contrast, there is abundant evidence for habitual use of ﬁre
during the Middle Paleolithic (ca. 250e50 kya) (e.g., Albert et al.,
1999; Meignen et al., 2007; Berna and Goldberg, 2008;
Sandgathe et al., 2011a; Albert et al., 2012; Aldeias et al., 2012;
Goldberg et al., 2012; Mentzer, 2014; Weinstein-Evron et al.,
2012). Wrangham and Carmody (2010), who based their argument
on biological models, as well as Gowlett and Wrangham (2013),
who used a wider perspective including biological and archaeological evidence, assert that the available archaeological record

fails to reveal a clear point in time when ﬁre became a regular
component in hominin behavioral repertoire. Currently there is a
diversity of opinion on the topic. Some argue for the onset of
habitual ﬁre use at the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene or
earlier (>700 kya) (e.g., Alperson-Aﬁl, 2008; Alperson-Aﬁl and
Goren-Inbar, 2010; Wrangham and Carmody, 2010; Gowlett and
Wrangham, 2013; Twomey, 2013), whereas others believe that it
developed only around 300e400 kya (e.g., Rolland, 2004; de
Lumley, 2006; Karkanas et al., 2007; Roebroeks and Villa, 2011;
Shahack-Gross et al., 2014). A few scholars argue for a much
later date for the ability to regularly kindle ﬁre, sometime after
250 kya (Sandgathe et al., 2011b).
Identifying when habitual ﬁre use emerged is of major importance for understanding human evolutionary history. Whereas ﬁre
offered many potential advantages to hominins (e.g. Pyne, 2001; de
Lumley, 2006; Stiner et al., 2011), its full impact on biological and
behavioral evolution would have been felt only when ﬁre became a
routine component of hominin lifeways (Rolland, 2004). The exact
time frame in which ﬁre became a regular part of human behavior
is thus central to our reconstruction of several key features of
evolutionary history, including changes in anatomy (e.g.,
Wrangham, 2009; Wrangham and Carmody, 2010), the dispersal of
hominins into temperate regions (e.g., Gowlett, 2006; Alperson-

Aﬁl, 2008; Alperson-Aﬁl and Goren-Inbar, 2010; Gowlett and
Wrangham, 2013), as well as the intensiﬁed social interactions
within base camps (e.g., Rolland, 2004; Stiner et al., 2011).
Fire would have provided many advantages to hominins,
including cooked food, warmth, light and protection from predators (e.g., Rolland, 2004; de Lumley, 2006; Wobber et al., 2008;
Wrangham, 2009; Wrangham and Carmody, 2010; Gowlett and
Wrangham, 2013). The many advantages of ﬁre lead us to two
suppositions. First, we assume that ﬁre became a regular, even
permanent part of their adaptations once hominins had solved the
technical challenge of kindling and maintaining it. This corresponds
with the prediction that habitual ﬁre should appear in the paleoanthropological record as a ‘punctuated event’ (Rolland, 2004).
Second, as a behavioral feature deeply embedded in human culture
(Rolland, 2004; Sandgathe et al., 2011a) the habitual use of ﬁre
should be manifest across many broadly contemporaneous sites

that share other cultural and technological features (Sandgathe
et al., 2011b). Following these studies we refer to habitual ﬁre as
an action embedded in human behavior and culture. Archaeologically, we expect habitual use of ﬁre to be manifest repetitively at a
cluster of sites belonging to the same time period or cultural
complex. The search for the archaeological manifestation of this
behavior have focused on a single location (e.g., de Lumley, 2006) or
have taken a very broad view, incorporating the most reliable case
studies from particular continents (e.g., Rolland, 2004; Roebroeks
and Villa, 2011). In this study we adopt a middle-ground perspective. We begin by concentrating on one very long, semi-continuous
sequence (Tabun Cave) but then expand out to incorporate evidence from semi-contemporaneous sequences from across the
Levant. In this way we are able to document changes in use of ﬁre
within a regional ‘population’ rather than a single site or a widely
scattered set of sites.

Because of its exceptionally long stratigraphic sequence,
covering the Lower Paleolithic through the late Middle Paleolithic,
Tabun Cave, Mount Carmel (Garrod and Bate, 1937; Jelinek et al.,
1973; Jelinek, 1982; Ronen et al., 2011), constitutes an ideal locale
for tracking changes in the frequency and regularity of ﬁre use
among Pleistocene hominins. The fact that the site is a cave also
reduces the likelihood of ﬁres within the archaeological sediments
having been caused by natural agents (Roebroeks and Villa, 2011).
The rich archaeological record of the Levant further enables us to
check for corroborative evidence at multiple sites. Combining these
two sets of data enables us to more clearly identify the point in time
at which ﬁre use became a regular and widespread part of human
behavior, and to overcome the difﬁculties former studies encountered in trying to track consistency in ﬁre use across time and space.
Tabun Cave was ﬁrst excavated in 1929e1934 by D.A.E Garrod,
who exposed a 25 m deep sequence of archaeological layers
spanning the Lower to the Middle Paleolithic (Garrod and Bate,
1937). Investigations were resumed in 1967e1971 by A. Jelinek
(Jelinek et al., 1973; Jelinek, 1982), who re-excavated a 10 m deep
sequence at the middle of the proﬁle left by Garrod's excavation,
and later by A. Ronen (Ronen et al., 2011), who excavated an
additional 6 m below Jelinek's trench, reaching bedrock. In this
study we combine results from Jelinek's and Ronen's excavations,
together forming a sequence of 100 archaeological layers spanning
a 16 m depth of sediments and representing ca. 500 ky (Mercier
et al., 2000; Mercier and Valladas, 2003) (Fig. 1). This includes
layers J1-J85 and J90 from Jelinek's excavation (Jelinek et al., 1973;
Jelinek, 1982) and layers R62-R75 [original layer record; e.g.,
Shifroni and Ronen, 2000] from Ronen's excavation (Ronen et al.,
2011). In order to avoid confusion, layers from Jelinek's and
Ronen's excavations are labeled with the letters J and R, respectively. The examined sequence includes: (a) Layers R75-R64
(Shifroni and Ronen, 2000) from the Lower Paleolithic Acheulian
(e.g., Bar-Yosef, 1994). These are undated but located below Unit
XIV, which is dated to 415 ± 27 kya (Mercier et al., 2000); (b) Layers
R63-R62 and J90-J70 (Jelinek, 1982, 1990; Shifroni and Ronen,
2000; Shimelmitz et al., 2014) from the Acheulo-Yabrudian complex of the late Lower Paleolithic (e.g., Copeland, 2000), which are
dated from 415 ± 27 to 264 ± 28 kya (Mercier and Valladas, 2003);
(c) Layers J69-J1 (Jelinek et al., 1973; Jelinek, 1982; Shimelmitz and
Kuhn, 2013) from the Middle Paleolithic Levantine Mousterian (e.g.,
Shea, 2003), dated to between 256 ± 26 and 165 ± 16 kya (Mercier
and Valladas, 2003).
Previous studies in Tabun identiﬁed the use of ﬁre through ﬁeld
observations in Jelinek's Unit's I-II (Jelinek et al., 1973) and possibly
Garrod's Layer E (Garrod and Bate, 1937). Traces of ﬁre were also
detected through geoarchaeological analyses in Mousterian Units
I-II (Albert et al., 1999) and in the Acheulo-Yabrudian layers toward
the middle-lower part of the sequence (Tsatskin, 2000). The successful thermoluminescence dating conducted on burnt ﬂints
retrieved from Units IeXIV (Mercier et al., 2000; Mercier and
Valladas, 2003) is another indication of the use of ﬁre at the site
during the late Lower Paleolithic and the Middle Paleolithic.
Materials and methods
We examined the use of ﬁre at Tabun based on the presence of
burnt ﬂint items (ﬂints with visible signs of heat alteration)
(Alperson-Aﬁl, 2008; Alperson-Aﬁl and Goren-Inbar, 2010; Aldeias
et al., 2012). Results of geoarchaeological research (Albert et al.,
1999; Tsatskin, 2000) on Tabun are also incorporated into our
study. Globally there is no evidence of intentional heat-treatment
of ﬂint during the Middle and Lower Paleolithic in Eurasia
(although it does appear in Africa in the Middle Stone Age at ca.
160 kya; Brown et al., 2009). Thus, we can assume that ﬂints were

burnt accidentally, through kindling ﬁres on top of previously
abandoned artifacts or via discarding debris into hearths. Studies of
the distribution of burnt ﬂints further demonstrate that burnt artifacts are found not only within hearths but also scattered
throughout the general area of excavations, a result of processes
such as cleaning out of ﬁreplaces, trampling and earth moving (e.g.,
Sergant et al., 2006; Alperson-Aﬁl, 2008; Alperson-Aﬁl and GorenInbar, 2010; Aldeias et al., 2012). Consequently, when ﬁre was used
at the site, burnt material is expected to appear in a broad area. As
such, the frequency of burnt ﬂints should be a suitable proxy for the
frequency of ﬁres within the cave. Finally, because stone is so durable, burnt ﬂints are not expected to suffer from the same degree
of post-depositional alteration and destruction as are hearth features, heated sediments, charcoal and ash or even burnt bones.
Our analysis refers only to ﬂint items larger than 2.5 cm.
Although examining smaller items might be fruitful as well (e.g.,
Alperson-Aﬁl, 2008; Alperson-Aﬁl and Goren-Inbar, 2010), the
cemented sediments in some layers prevented excavators from
collecting smaller debris. Additionally, focusing on larger objects
avoids some potential biasing effects of thermal fracture, whereby a
single burnt piece could be transformed into hundreds of tiny burnt
fragments.
Only layers with samples of 300 or more items were incorporated into our study. The layers from Jelinek's Units III-VIII were
excluded as well because they have been reworked by erosion,
especially Units III-VI (Jelinek et al., 1973; Jelinek, 1982). From
Ronen's excavation we included only the layers directly underlying
Jelinek's excavations so as to minimize possible problems in
correlating layers.
Burnt artifacts were divided into two categories: ‘extremely’ and
‘moderately’ burnt. The former bears characteristics typical of
exposure to heat levels 300  C, including changes in color and
texture, pot-lid fractures and crazing (Sergant et al., 2006). Thermoluminescence studies of ﬂints from Tabun cave support their
alteration by ﬁre (Mercier et al., 2000; Mercier and Valladas, 2003).
Artifacts belonging to the ’moderately burnt' group bear some of
the same signs of heating but they are fewer and less well
expressed. To minimize ambiguities in the search for combustion
features through the spatial analysis (using ArcGIS 10) we focused
on the ‘extreme’ burnt items.
Results
Of the 100 layers, we examined a total of the 27 larger assemblages (>300 items) from Tabun, incorporating a sample of 43,405
items (Fig. 2), constituting ca. 80% of the ﬁnds retrieved from this
locale. The frequencies of 'extremely' and 'moderately' burnt ﬂints
show a strong positive correlation across the layers studied (Pearson's r ¼ 0.836; p < 0.001), conﬁrming that the 'moderately' heated
items primarily resulted from exposure to heat. Accordingly, we
incorporated the items in both categories into our analysis.
Marked changes in frequencies of burnt items over the long
stratigraphic sequence at Tabun indicate clear ﬂuctuations in the
occurrence of ﬁre within the cave. Within the lower layers of the
site, layers R66 to J82, attributed to the Lower Paleolithic Acheulean
and early Acheulo-Yabrudian complex, burnt ﬂint items are practically absent, with 'extremely' burnt ﬂint items constituting just
0e0.7% of the total assemblage. Adding the 'moderately' burnt
items increases the total of burnt ﬂint items up to 1.3% only. Layers
R75-R67, just above bedrock, are not included in this study since
the assemblages are very small. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that
only isolated burnt ﬂints were found in these layers. The AcheuloYabrudian Layer J81 (in the middle of the sequence, 8 m below
datum and 8 m above bedrock) marks the ﬁrst real departure from
the trend seen in the earlier levels. Burnt ﬂints constitute ca. 10% of

Figure 2. Fluctuations in frequencies of ﬂints (2.5 cm) with heat alteration throughout the sequence of Tabun Cave demonstrating the changing intensity of ﬁre use. The division
into units and layers as well as their mean dates (Mercier et al., 2000; Mercier and Valladas, 2003) are presented. Since the date of Unit XIII is an anomaly we prefer to use the single
date of Bed 83 instead. A sharp transition appears in Layer J81, roughly dated to 357e324 kya. Below this layer burnt ﬂints are scarce or absent but above it they are a constant
feature of the assemblages.

the assemblage in layer J81. Because there is an unconformity at the
top of layer J81 it is possible that the burning actually occurred
during the deposition of layer J80, but this makes little difference in
terms of chronology. Moving upwards through the sequence, proportions of burnt ﬂints ﬂuctuate within a relatively limited range
(8.4e23.1%) in the overlying layers associated with the AcheuloYabrudian complex (J80-J71). Although the individual layers are
relatively thick (ca. 30e40 cm) and most likely represent a series of
occupations rather than a single event, in some of these layers
patterns in the distribution of 'extremely' burnt ﬂints can still be
detected (Fig. 3).
Since burnt ﬂints crack and shatter into numerous pieces, we
also provide a different perspective that includes the presence of
burnt material (extreme and moderate) solely among whole and
proximal blanks (including shaped items) (Fig. 4). This was conducted on a cluster of several sub-beds that are currently under
technological analysis and not on the entire set of assemblages.
While the results show slightly different values than in Fig. 2, the
general trend is the same.
The results of geoarchaeological studies at Tabun (Tsatskin,
2000) are also consistent with the observed differences in
burning frequencies across the stratigraphy. A variety of burnt
material including tiny ﬂint chips and bone fragments as well as
heated soil aggregates was observed within the micromorphological thin-sections from layers attributed to Units XII-XIII but no such
traces of ﬁre were found in Unit XIV (Layer J90). We note that
changing frequencies of burnt ﬂints at Tabun are not simply a
consequence of ﬂuctuating densities of ﬂints within the deposits. In
fact, within Units XI-XIV, there is a weak but negative relationship
between the frequencies of burnt ﬂints and overall ﬁnd density
(r ¼ 0.397, df ¼ 93, p < 0.001).
Based on existing thermoluminescence dates, we can conclude
that habitual ﬁre use at Tabun began sometime before 324 ± 31 kya,
the mean date of Unit XII (Mercier and Valladas, 2003). The upper

part of Unit XIII suffered from a certain degree of erosion before
Unit XII began forming, which may explain the problematic
younger mean date (302 ± 27 kya). Of the four thermoluminescence dates obtained from Unit XIII, three (T63, T64, T68) were
from layer J81, which was most affected by this erosion and
exposure. The remaining sample (T67) dated to 357 ± 33 kya came
from a deeper layer (J83) and puts a lower limit on the documented
shift in pyrotechnology. Thus, we date the emergence of habitual
use of ﬁre at Tabun to somewhere between 357 and 324 kya.
The trends in burning frequencies at Tabun are not monotonic.
The early Middle Paleolithic deposits, Layers J68eJ63, actually
contain a smaller proportion of burnt ﬂints than some earlier layers,
although the regular use of ﬁre is clearly evident. There is a dramatic rise in the percentage of burnt ﬂints in Layers J25eJ19 of the
mid-Middle Paleolithic. The higher frequencies of burnt pieces in
these layers accord with the presence of clearly visible black and
white hearth layers with traces of burnt wood in the sediments
(Albert et al., 1999).
Discussion
The scarce evidence of ﬁre at the lowest layers of Tabun Cave
attributed to the Acheulean and early Acheulo-Yabrudian ﬁts the
general pattern within Eurasia, where similarly early ﬁre use was
reported from a few isolated cases (Roebroeks and Villa, 2011). In
order to examine whether the trend in ﬁre use within the Tabun
sequence reﬂects a regional rather than a local pattern we examined published evidence from other sites and layers associated
with the Acheulo-Yabrudian complex. The advantages of examining the Acheulo-Yabrudian complex is that it is conﬁned to a
relatively limited geographic area, the eastern Mediterranean
Levant, and is restricted to the later part of the Middle Pleistocene,
ranging between 415 and 250/220 kya (Mercier et al., 2000;
Mercier and Valladas, 2003; Gopher et al., 2010; Valladas et al.,

Figure 3. Density maps of heavily burnt ﬂints in Beds J79 (aec) and J80A (dee), Unit XII, dated to 324 kya. Bed J80A constitutes the upper part of layer J80 (n ¼ 1470). Top row (a, d)
contains density maps of all artifacts; middle row (b, e) contains density maps of heavily burnt pieces; bottom row show the result of dividing the heavily burnt raster map by the
raster of all artifacts, analogous to the local proportion of burnt pieces. The maps show areas with particularly high frequencies of burnt artifacts (circled in red) in both layers, which
may be indicative of traces of combustion features or ‘rake out’ from nearby hearths. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the

2013). Almost all Acheulo-Yabrudian assemblages come from cave
sites, hence the depositional contexts are also relatively similar to
Tabun.
Qesem Cave, which spans the period of ca. 400e220 kya
(Gopher et al., 2010; Mercier et al., 2013) is one of the best comparators for the middle part of the Tabun sequence. There is a
marked difference between the upper and lower parts of the Qesem
sequence. Although burnt ﬂints and bones were present in the
lower layers, geoarchaeological analysis revealed only few combustion products in sediments; this is in marked contrast to the
upper part of the sequence, where the sediments were packed with
ash and other combustion products (Karkanas et al., 2007). A
marked increase in the frequency of burnt bones within the lower
sequence at Qesem cave (Stiner et al., 2011) seems to parallel the
observations on burnt ﬂints from Tabun. The newly reported hearth
from Qesem, dated to ca. 300 kya is further evidence of this transition in the use of ﬁre at the cave (Shahack-Gross et al., 2014).

Yabrud I, Syria may also document a similar trend, although the
data are more coarse-grained. Yabrud I contains a long sequence of
Lower and Middle Paleolithic levels. Farrand (1965: 39) examined
Rust's (1950) section and mentioned “six discontinuous hearth
levels” in elevation 2.5e3.3 m and another “very prominent hearth
layer, almost 10 cm thick” at elevation 4.5 m. This was also
conﬁrmed by de Heinzelin (1966). These elevations correlate to
the later part of the Acheulo-Yabrudian layers at the site (Layers
11e18; Rust, 1950). During the excavations of Solecki and Solecki
several additional hearths were identiﬁed within the AcheuloYabrudian layers, some of them were associated with sets of
stones “ … which appeared to have encircled (the) hearths … ”
(Solecki, 1970: 204). These reports mention no evidence of ﬁre in
the lower part of the sequence of Yabrud I (Layers 19e25; Rust,
1950).
Evidence from other Acheulo-Yabrudian sites with shorter
stratigraphic sequences further conﬁrms that use of ﬁre was a

generalized behavioral pattern during that period. Geoarchaeological studies identiﬁed traces of ﬁre in all of the cave sites
examined that preserve Acheulo-Yabrudian layers (Table 1). The
only sites where ﬁre was not recognized are open-air springmound locations in Syria (Le Tensorer et al., 2007). Although the
cited studies used different methods, the composite picture is that
ﬁre was an integral part of hominin activities in cave sites of the
later Acheulo-Yabrudian complex across the eastern Mediterranean
region. It is also important that Qesem, Tabun and possibly Yabrud
all show that a more regular use of ﬁre emerged within the
Acheulo-Yabrudian complex rather than at its beginning. Thus, it is
not associated with a major change in material culture or the
appearance of new hominin population. In addition, while traces of
ﬁre might be expected to be more common in cave sites as opposed
to open-air sites, the Levantine evidence does not simply correlate
with more frequent use of caves. Whereas most of the earlier
Acheulean sites are open-air localities (e.g., Bar-Yosef, 1994),

201

increases in the regularity of burning post-date the earliest
Acheulo-Yabrudian cave occupations at Tabun, Qesem and Yabrud.
By roughly 200 kya ﬁre was commonly used wherever hominins
were able to survive (Rolland, 2004; Roebroeks and Villa, 2011;
Mentzer, 2014). Evidence pertaining to the frequency of ﬁre varies throughout the Middle Paleolithic of the Levant. While some
sites show a slight decline in the amount or intensity of burning
during the early Middle Paleolithic, as in Tabun, others show
distinct hearths and pronounced burning activities as demonstrated by the frequent burnt ﬂints and other materials (e.g.,
Weinstein-Evron et al., 2012). The intensive use of ﬁre in the assemblages of Tabun Unit I, reﬂected in the exceptionally large
quantities of burnt ﬂints may be connected to another transformation in the use and management of ﬁre, but it may also simply
reﬂect a more continuous occupation of this particular cave.
Conclusions
The ubiquity of evidence from Acheulo-Yabrudian sites in the
Levant makes it clear that ﬁre became a regular part of hominin
behavior during the second half of the Middle Pleistocene. Given
the available dates, our best estimate for the onset of regular ﬁre
use at Tabun is between 357 and 324 kya. These results are in
agreement with the recent review of early evidence of ﬁre from
Europe and around the globe (Rolland, 2004; Roebroeks and Villa,
2011), which concludes that the earliest sporadic traces of ﬁre in
Europe appear during MIS 11-10, with an increase in the frequency
of evidence in MIS 9. However, the ﬁndings from the Levant provide
a density of coverage in time and space that is currently unavailable
elsewhere. Consistent evidence for ﬁre is found not just in the
Tabun sequence but at every Acheulo-Yabrudian cave site where
good information is available. The near-absence of burnt ﬂints in
the lower 8 m of the sequence at Tabun (composed of 19 layers) also
indicates that the scarcity of ﬁre evidence before 350 kya is not just
a matter of spotty preservation, or cave sites versus open air-sites
(e.g., Gowlett and Wrangham, 2013). Rather, the negative evidence from the early layers is genuine, and there is a signiﬁcant and
permanent increase in the frequency of evidence for burning between 357 and 324 kya. This is the period in which the ‘technological mutation’ underlying habitual use of ﬁre emerged. We
suggest that the changes in burning frequency at Tabun and Qesem
not only signal the point in time where the use of ﬁre became
habitual, but also indicate that humans had mastered the art of
kindling ﬁre. Unfortunately there are no means currently available
to directly determine how ancient ﬁres were started, so the latter
remains simply a hypothesis for the time being.

Initial dates for any historical phenomenon are minimum estimates and new discoveries almost inevitably push the ages of
‘ﬁrsts’ back in time. The archaeological signal is much stronger
when behaviors become widespread and habitual. While the
earliest evidence of ﬁre associated with hominin activities is much
older, the data presented here indicate that ﬁre became a regular
and constant part of hominin behavioral adaptations in Eurasia
only after 350 kya. The beneﬁts of ﬁre for processing food, altering
raw materials or enhancing social interactions would be fully
realized only when use of ﬁre shifted from opportunistic and occasional to habitual and regular. Regular use of ﬁre changed hominin existence and inﬂuenced the direction of evolution in our
lineage in a diversity of ways (Rolland, 2004; Wrangham and
Carmody, 2010; Stiner et al., 2011). To the extent that humans'
physical, cognitive and social evolution was affected by the emergence of habitual ﬁre use, we should be able to trace evidence for
such impacts most clearly in the hominins that inhabited the
landscape over the last 350 kya.
