The historical Norberg mining district in central Sweden with its shallow, easily accessible iron ores
ﬁgures prominently in the earliest documents from the 14th century concerning mining or metallurgy.
This 1000-km2 district is considered to be one of the ﬁrst areas in Sweden exploited for iron ores and, in
fact, Europe’s oldest known blast furnace, Lapphyttan, is located in the Norberg district about 10 km from
the mines in the village of Norberg (Norbergsby). Earlier archaeological excavations suggest the furnace
was in operation as early as the 11th or 12th century (870 and 930 14C yr BP), and a number of other sites
in the district have been dated to the 13the15th centuries. Here, we have analyzed two lake sediment
records (Kalven and Noren) from the village of Norberg and a peat record from Lapphyttan. The Lapphyttan peat record was radiocarbon dated, whereas the sediment from Kalven is annually laminated,
which provides a fairly precise chronology. Our pollen data indicate that land use in the area began
gradually as forest grazing by at least c. AD 1050, with indications of more widespread forest disturbance
and cultivation from c. 1180 at Lapphyttan and 1250 at Kalven. Based on 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratios in
Kalven’s varved sediment record, there is an indication of mining or metallurgy in the area c. 960, but
likely not in immediate connection to our sites. Evidence of mining and metallurgy increases gradually
from c. 1180 when there is a decline in 206Pb/207Pb ratios and an increase in charcoal particles at Lapphyttan, followed by increasing inputs of lithogenic elements in Noren’s sediment record indicating soil
disturbance, which we attribute to the onset of mining the iron ore bodies surrounding Noren. From AD
1295 onwards evidence of mining and metallurgy are ubiquitous, and activities accelerate especially
during the late 15th century; the maximum inﬂuence of Bergslagen ore lead (i.e., the minimum in
206
Pb/207Pb isotope ratios) in both Kalven and Noren occurs c. 1490e1500, when also varve properties
change in Kalven and in Noren sharp increases occur in the concentrations of a range of other ore-related
metals (e.g., arsenic, cadmium, copper, iron, lead, mercury and zinc). From the 15th century onwards
mining and metallurgy are the dominant feature of the sediment records.

1. Introduction
The Norberg mining district, which lies in the midst of an
extensive iron ore belt in the Bergslagen region in central Sweden,
ﬁgures prominently in the early history of iron ore extraction and
iron production. The iron-ore ﬁeld crossing through Norberg
includes both banded quartz and skarn iron ores, with grades
ranging from 43 to 62% iron, as well as occurrences of other iron-ore

types. These deposits and those throughout Bergslagen are set in
country rocks with ages of 1500e1900 Ma (Ripa, 2001). The Norberg
mining district is one of 23 historical mining districts that comprise
the Bergslagen region (Fig. 1), where smelters and furnaces could be
counted in the hundreds and mine pits and shafts in the thousands.
All of the known sites are catalogued in the 23 volumes of the ‘Atlas
of Sweden’s bergslag’. Our aim here, however, is not to study all of
the districts but to focus on the Norberg mining district (Swedish:
Norbergs bergslag); rather, we focus on the heart of the district in the
area surrounding the village of Norberg (Norbergsby), which lies in
the center of the Norberg ore ﬁeld that stretches 25 km northeast

from Fagersta to Avesta. Although we present our research as
a speciﬁc case study focused on two lake sediment records and also
one from a mire, the implications of our study are broader in extent
and contribute to the general understanding of the early history of
mining and its importance for the economic developments that
supported the foundations of the Swedish state.
The establishment in the Norberg mining district of a blast
furnace at Lapphyttan in the late 12th century and other smelters
and furnaces during the late 13th and early 14th centuries
(Petterson Jensen, 2002) presupposes that the infrastructure for
mining and processing iron ores was already in place by that time.
Archaeological studies indicate that the 12th to 14th centuries were
a period of expansion in iron mining and metallurgy, but because
historical and archaeological evidence is quite limited during this
early period, in this study we turn our attention instead to the
record preserved in natural, long-term archives. Lake sediments, as
well as peat, are well established as archival material for studies
of environmental changes, such as the use of pollen records to
reconstruct land-use histories and geochemical records to study
atmospheric pollution. Unlike historical and archaeological records,
lake sediments and peat provide in most cases a continuous record
of environmental changes e ecological as well as geochemical e
surrounding a site. Over the past decade there has been an
increasing number of studies aimed at studying early metallurgy
using sediments or peat that have combined analyses of the pollen
record and the geochemical record in an effort to both identify early
mining activities at speciﬁc sites and understand more generally
their impact on surrounding landscapes (Mighall et al., 2002;
Monna et al., 2004b; Martínez Cortizas et al., 2005).
In this study we have analyzed the sediment records from two
lakes in Norberg (Kalven and Noren; Fig. 1) and the peat record
from a small mire at Lapphyttan, and placed these data into
perspective relative to results of past and on-going archaeological
surveys. Although some of our analyses cover the full sediment
sequence, we focus attention on the period prior to the 17th
century, before which historical documents are quite few and less
speciﬁc and archaeological evidence is patchy. Besides the speciﬁc
issue of mining history, an additional question that arises is the
interaction between settlement and mining, and which of these
was the driving force behind colonization of remote areas of central
Sweden. The lead records of Kalven and Noren were previously
published in Bindler et al. (2009) as part of a regional landscapescale study of the impacts of mining in Bergslagen. Here, in addition
to a more speciﬁc assessment of the lead records we present new
data on varve properties, new geochemical analyses, as well as
pollen and charcoal. Important questions were: When do the ﬁrst
signals of local mining and processing of ores occur? When did land
use begin in this area; is there evidence that settlement occurred
before mining began or did it co-occur with mining?
Not only the general early mining history of Norberg is of
interest here, but more speciﬁcally also that in 2008 a new furnace
site was identiﬁed on the eastern inlet to Kalven (Fig. 1). The initial
archaeological evidence, particularly regarding the appearance of
the ﬁning hearths (färskningshärdar), suggests an early medieval
history. Given the location of our coring site in Kalven in the deep
basin opposite this stream inlet, a more detailed review of our
published and new data can provide speciﬁc insights into the
precise time of operation of this newly found site, which hopefully
might be excavated in the next few years.

related sites have been registered, which include at least 360
mining areas consisting of more than 1030 mine pits or shafts, >115
smelting houses or furnaces and >40 forges (Petterson, 1994). The
brief historical summary that follows below is based on Petterson
(1994), Magnusson (2002), Petterson Jensen (2002) and references therein.
Norberg’s mines were ﬁrst mentioned in AD 1303 in a deed of
exchange between Tyrgils Knutsson and Birger Magnusson. This
document mentions iron and steel ore bodies (‘steel’ in this case
referred to a manganese-rich iron ore) owned by Knutsson, which
are interpreted as referring to iron ores from Kärrgruvan and the
manganese-rich iron ores from Klackberg, where also dolomite was
mined. These two mining sites adjoin our study lakes to the east
and west, respectively. Both of these ore types, though not necessarily from these speciﬁc mines, were processed at Lapphyttan only
8 km to the east, near the village of Olsbenning. Lapphyttan, which
was excavated during the early 1980s (Magnusson, 1984), is the
oldest known blast furnace in Europe and was used to produce cast
iron that was then reﬁned to make osmund iron. The blast furnace
is of a similar type to those found in northern Germany and there
are generally many parallels and direct connections between the
historical developments of mining and metallurgy in Sweden with
those in Germany, cf. (Jockenhövel, 1996). The Lapphyttan site
includes not only a blast furnace, but also the remains of a dammed
pond upstream and traces of a waterwheel, iron shed, roasting pits,
a stable and dwelling house, slag heaps, reﬁnery slags, and reﬁning
furnaces.
Archaeological excavations have thus far yielded radiocarbon
dated material that indicates Lapphyttan had started operation by
the late 12th century and was used to produce cast iron probably
into the latter half of the 14th century when production was moved
elsewhere. The calibrated age ranges of the oldest radiocarbon
dates (930  75 BP, 870  70 14C BP) are imprecise, however,
because of a small plateau in atmospheric 14C that occurs during
this period. Besides Lapphyttan, a few other blast furnaces were
also established in the area around the end of the 13th century. The
historical signiﬁcance of blast furnaces, besides the economic value
of the iron produced, was that they necessitated a greater level of
organization, because these furnaces were operated round the
clock for a few or several months. This required not only a supply of
iron ore, but also large quantities of charcoal, more people
throughout the supply chain, and increased food production.
In a document from 1332 a site called Midhlingebærg is
mentioned, which is thought to be Meling in the city of Fagersta,
10 km southwest of Norberg. Although historical evidence of
mining doesn’t exist until the 17th century, the inventory of
archaeological sites in Meling suggests mining took place earlier.
The Norberg mining district received a renewed concession in 1420
at the same time that Bispberg (Bitsberg) ﬁrst received its concession. Documents from 1558 to 1559 refer to Bondgruvan, Risbergsfältet (Gamble Noreberg j Norebergxlagen), Stripåsen (Strijpen
mz monge gruffer e transl.: Stripen with many mines), and Klackberg (Klackegruffwn mz monge gruffwer e transl.: Klackberg with
many mines), but further mention of Norberg during the 15th and
16th centuries is quite limited. After this time period documentation becomes more extensive. Up until the early 17th century the
evidence indicates that the mines in Norberg were generally quite
shallow, less than 7 m (4 fathoms), and also so many in number that
it was impossible to count accurately even at that time.

historical and archaeological evidence

2. Site description and sampling

The Norberg mining district is considered the oldest of the early
iron mining districts in Sweden. More than 1000 historical mining-

Our two study lakes, Kalven and Noren, are within the presentday municipality of Norberg, which is surrounded by a large
number of mines, both smaller pits and larger mines, most notably

R. Bindler et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 38 (2011) 291e300

those at Klackberg, which separates the two lakes to the west
(Fig. 1) and Kärrgruvan, which is located to the east (just outside the
boundaries of the map). Note that the Klackberg and Kolningsberg
mine ﬁelds lay on the south-facing slope of the ridge dividing
Kalven and Noren. In addition we sampled a mire located immediately downslope of the blast furnace site at Lapphyttan, about
8 km east of Norberg.
2.1. Kalven and Noren: lake sediment records
Complete lake sediment proﬁles were collected from the deep
basin of Kalven in March 2003 (20.8 m water depth) and Noren
during March 2004 (9.3 m water depth). These sediment proﬁles
were sampled using a combination of a freeze core (Renberg, 1981)
for the recent, less-consolidated surface sediment (0 to approximately 60 cm depth) and for the older, more consolidated sediment
below a Russian peat corer (1 m length, 8 cm diameter), which was
used to collect a series of overlapping sediment cores. For Kalven
the series of sediment cores were matched based on correlating
distinctive varves (annual laminations) in the overlapping core
sections; the complete proﬁle had a total depth of 450 cm. The
sediment from Noren had laminations in the uppermost 30 cm and
some color changes down to 60 cm depth but was otherwise
homogenous in appearance, and the cores were correlated based
on ﬁeld-measured depths and matching of visual characteristics;
the total proﬁle is 465 cm thick. The freeze cores were stored in
a freezer room at 20  C, and the Russian peat cores in a walk-in
cooler at þ4  C.
In the freezer room, the frozen cores were prepared by cutting
out one face of the freeze core and then removing the outer,
disturbed surfaces using a hand plane. Thereafter the prepared
slabs were sectioned into 1-cm slices with a band-saw; in the case

293

of Kalven the number of varves were ﬁrst counted in each slice. For
the geochemical analyses sub-samples were taken from the surface
freeze cores at 5-cm intervals. In the Russian cores sub-samples
were taken out at 10-cm intervals in the upper 1e2 m and at
20e25-cm intervals further down. In Kalven most of these
sub-samples spanned about 5 cm depth, which corresponds to
about 50e85 years per sample; however, to improve the resolution
of the lead record for the period from AD 960 to 1877 an additional
11 sub-samples were included that were 1-cm thick, spanning only
15e20 years per sample. The sub-samples from Noren were 1-cm
thick. All samples were freeze dried prior to analysis.
One difﬁculty in merging sediment and peat records with
archaeological evidence and written records is the problem of
matching chronologies. However, the varved sediments from
Kalven provide us with a fairly precise chronology based on varve
counting (Renberg, 1981; Segerström et al., 1984). Varve counting
was performed by two persons using a stereomicroscope (50
magniﬁcation). Varves were counted to a depth of 2.5 m (3353
varve years).
2.2. Lapphyttan: peat record
The Lapphyttan site is located 8 km to the east of Norberg. We
collected a 1.2-m-long peat proﬁle using a small barrel Russian peat
corer (diameter 5 cm, length 75 cm) from the small mire located
below the remains of the blast furnace and its surrounding ﬁning
heaps; the small stream passing alongside the former blast furnace
ﬂows into the mire. Two overlapping cores were collected to cover
the 1.2-m deep peat. Samples were taken at 5-cm intervals from the
25 to 120 cm depth for lead analyses, and for pollen at 5-cm
intervals from 25 to 95 cm depth, with additional sampling at
0.5-cm intervals from 55 to 60 cm depth.

For the peat record from Lapphyttan four samples from three
levels were radiocarbon dated (Tandemlaboratoriet, Uppsala
University). These samples are (Table 1): Sphagnum leaves, 49 cm
depth; wood fragment, also from 49 cm; charcoal fragment, 59 cm;
and bulk peat from 69 cm, because the peat material was highly
decomposed and no intact plant macrofossils could be found.
Samples were treated with 1% HCl and then 1% NaOH prior to
analysis. Radiocarbon ages are calibrated to calendar years using
Calib radiocarbon calibration ver. 5.0.2 (calib.qub.ac.uk/).
2.3. Magnetic susceptibility and geochemistry
We measured the magnetic susceptibility of the upper 1 m of
the varved sediment record from Kalven using a Bartington MS2
meter with a MS2E sensor. The sensitivity of the meter was set at
106 SI.
Lead data from Kalven and Noren were previously published in
Bindler et al. (2009), and further details on those analyses can be
found there. Data from Lapphyttan are new here. In brief, concentrations and stable lead isotopes (206Pb, 207Pb and 208Pb) were
analyzed in the dried samples using a PerkinElmer Elan 6100 ICPMS, after a strong-acid extraction using concentrated HNO3:HClO4
(10:1, v/v) (Renberg et al., 2002). The samples from Noren were
later analyzed for a suite of major and trace elements using an
energy dispersive XRF (Cheburkin and Shotyk, 1996), which
provides total element concentrations; here, we include data on
copper and zinc (sulﬁde ore metals, which may occur as intrusions
in the host rocks), iron (which has both lithogenic and ore origins)
and zirconium (lithogenic element, which is a useful indicator of
mineral matter inputs to the lake sediment).
Using stable lead isotope ratios it is possible to partition the lead
present in the sediment into natural and anthropogenic fractions,
and thereafter into different source fractions. For details on how
this is done see papers by Farmer et al. (1996), Brännvall et al.
(1999), Bindler et al. (2009). The lead naturally present in
Swedish soils and sediments has generally high 206Pb/207Pb ratios,
typically about 1.5 (range 1.3 to >3 Bindler et al., 1999; Renberg
et al., 2000; Brännvall et al., 2001; Klaminder et al., 2005),
whereas ores and coal from mainland Europe have lower values,
1.174  0.013 (range, 1.16e1.18; cf. Wedepohl et al., 1978; Sugden
et al., 1993; Stos-Gale et al., 1995; Wedepohl and Baumann, 1997;
Bindler et al., 1999; Monna et al., 2000; Cloy et al., 2008). Bergslagen ores, given their greater age and earlier isolation, in turn
have much lower isotope ratios that are also quite homogenous,
1.024  0.001 (Johansson and Rickard, 1985; Åberg and
Charalampides, 1986; Gebeyehu and Vivallo, 1991; Gebeyehu,
1993).
Most of the mercury data were previously published in Bindler
et al. (2009) and analyzed using thermal decomposition cold-vapor
atomic absorption spectrometry (Leco AMA-254). Additional
samples were analyzed here from Noren using a similar system
(PerkinElmer SMS100). Replicate analyses for each instrument and
between the two instruments were within 5%. Analyses of certiﬁed reference materials were within their certiﬁed range. Carbon

and nitrogen were analyzed using a PerkinElmer CHNS elemental
analyzer in CHN mode only.
2.4. Pollen
The preparation of samples for pollen analyses follows standard
methods. Sub-samples were treated with KOH and acetolysis
(Moore et al., 1991), and then the preparations were mounted in
safranin-stained glycerine. Approximately 600 pollen grains were
counted per slide, as were microscopic charcoal particles. The size
classes for the charcoal particles were <50 mm, 50e100 mm
and >100 mm; the larger size is considered to reﬂect local ﬁres
(cf. Tinner et al., 1998; Pitkänen et al., 1999; Olsson and Tryterud,
2000). Pollen identiﬁcation was based on general keys of Beug,
(1961) and Moore et al., (1991) and a reference pollen collection
available for critical examinations. The percentage frequencies of
the pollen are based against the total terrestrial pollen sum for each
sample.
3. Results
3.1. Age-depth modeling
The varved sediment record from Kalven provides us with
a fairly precise absolute chronology. The cumulative age error,
which is based on uncertain divisions between varves, is estimated
at 10 years after the ﬁrst 700 varve years (AD 1300) and 40 after
2000 years (AD 1). The varves were counted to 2.5 m depth (3353
varve years). For Noren our age-depth model is based on correlating
the distinctive changes in the lead isotope record from Noren with
that from Kalven (Fig. 2A) and applying a second-order polynomial
function.
The results of the radiocarbon dating from Lapphyttan and the
calibrated ages are presented in Table 1. For the Lapphyttan peat
record the age-depth model is based on a second-order polynomial
function for the 49e69 cm section e the primary period of interest
for our study e which is then extrapolated downward to 95 cm
depth. For the uppermost 49 cm we assume a simple linear model
(Fig. 2B).
3.2. Varve properties in Kalven
In Kalven there are only smaller changes in varve properties (i.e.,
color, thickness) from the period from 3353 to 706 varve years
before 2002, i.e., prior to AD 1295 (Fig. 3). The average varve
thickness during this 2600-year period is 0.62  0.08 mm yr1, but
is slightly lower during the period AD 1095e1295,
0.55  0.05 mm yr1. Varve thickness increases rapidly by 50% from
AD 1295 to 0.80 mm yr1. Five years after the varve thickness
begins to increase there is also a change towards a lighter color in
the varves, indicating a greater relative proportion of mineral
matter. These changes in varve properties (thickness and color)
from AD 1295 occur together with an abrupt increase in magnetic
susceptibility, which more than trebles in intensity and suggests an

Fig. 2. Age-depth models for: A) Noren and B) Lapphyttan. For Noren the chronology is based on matching 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratios in the sediment record from Noren to the
varved chronology from Kalven. For Lapphyttan we use a polynomial regression for the main period of interest (prior to AD 1500) and a simple linear accumulation for the
uppermost section.

inﬂux of material richer in ferromagnetic particles. Magnetic
susceptibility is sharply elevated over a 50-year period, after which
the values return to levels comparable to before this period.
The most distinct varves in the entire sediment sequence
from Kalven are those for AD 1492e1493, when the varves are
predominantly light colored with a thickness of about 1.5 mm yr1.
Over the next 17 years the light, non-winter layer gradually
decreases and the seasonal changes in color within varves resume
a more normal cycle after AD 1510. Varve properties do not change

notably again until the period AD 1590e1655, when the average
varve thickness increases to 1.08 mm yr1.
3.3. Pollen assemblage from Kalven and Lapphyttan
Selected data from the pollen analyses of Kalven’s varved sediment record are presented in Fig. 3; a complete presentation of the
pollen data is provided in the Supplementary data. Here we
summarize pollen related to human activities into the categories

206
Pb/207Pb record in Noren to the varved record from Kalven. Speciﬁc dates that are discussed in the text are marked: A) AD 80, Roman lead peak; B) AD 960, early input of
Bergslagen lead; C) AD 1050, ﬁrst indications of early forest grazing; D) AD 1296, changes in varve sediment properties indicating possible start of blast furnace found on the eastern
inlet stream; E) AD 1490, onset of large-scale mining in Norberg.

296

anthropocores and apophytes. Anthropocores are cereals and herbs
introduced by humans, whereas apophytes are shrubs, herbs and
weeds that are favored by human-related activities.
From AD 550 until 1050 the pollen assemblage indicates
a generally closed forest. Tree pollen comprise about 90e95% of the
total terrestrial pollen, with a predominance of pine (Pinus sylvestris) and birch (Betula spp.). Although the pollen assemblage in
Kalven indicates a generally closed forest, the ﬁrst rye pollen (Secale
cereale) e albeit just one grain e appears AD 960 at the same time
as a change in lead isotope composition.
Changes in the pollen assemblage during the period from AD
1050 to 1250 indicate an establishment of human settlements in
the general area surrounding Kalven. These changes are primarily
in the form of an increased number of pollen from grasses and
heather (Calluna), which are plants favored by disturbance. The
increase in these pollen types coincide with a small increase in
charcoal particles and an absence of juniper (Juniperus), which is
disfavored by ﬁre in contrast to heather.
After AD 1250 more signiﬁcant changes occur in the pollen
assemblage, which indicate more direct human settlement in close
physical proximity to the lake. The pollen from this point in time
include a decline in tree pollen from 90 to 85%, which is dominated
by a decline in pine. Successional tree types such as alder (Alnus)
and birch increase somewhat, but more importantly there are
increases in diverse cereal pollen, hemp (Cannabis) and plants
favored by disturbance, which together indicate cultivation.
From AD 1600 there is an expansion in agriculture e speciﬁcally
cultivation. The percentage of tree pollen declines further, while
the number of larger charcoal particles increase. Anthropocores, in
particular rye, increase sharply; in the case of rye pollen the
percentage increases from 1 to 7% of the total terrestrial pollen.

Selected data from the pollen analyses of the peat record from
Lapphyttan are presented in Fig. 4; a complete presentation of the
pollen data is provided in the Supplementary data. Like the pollen
record from Kalven the older levels from Lapphyttan indicate
a closed forest structure dominated by pine. The number of
deciduous pollen declines over the period from c. 2000 BC until c. 1
BC, e.g., oak (Quercus) and lime (Tilia), which accelerates in
response to forest disturbance c. AD 300 as indicated by an increase
in charcoal particles, increase in pollen from herbs and a further
decline in lime.
The period from AD 950 to 1180 is characterized by recurring
disturbance. This is indicated by a loss of lime pollen, irregular oak
percentages and ﬁnally complete loss by 1180, increasing juniper
and herbs and other apophyte pollen types. There is a radical
change in the landscape c. AD 1180 with a large increase in charcoal
particles, a loss of deciduous pollen, decline in pine and increases in
both anthropocores and apophytes.
3.4. Sediment geochemistry in Kalven and Noren
Although the lead data have been published a brief summary is
beneﬁcial (Fig. 3). Prior to 2000 years ago the lead concentrations
and stable isotope composition of both of the sediment records are
quite stable, and similar to other sediment records in Sweden
(Brännvall et al., 1999, 2001). In Kalven background values are
15.5  2.3 mg Pb g1 and 1.483  0.007 for 206Pb/207Pb, and in Noren
these are 14.4  2.0 mg Pb g1 and 1.479  0.005 for 206Pb/207Pb. In
Kalven the well-established peak in lead pollution about 2000 years
ago can be identiﬁed, particularly on the basis of a small, but
signiﬁcant decline in the 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratio about AD 80
(Brännvall et al., 1999). This peak in lead and the accompanying

Fig. 4. Pollen, charcoal and lead (concentrations and 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratio) for Lapphyttan. Dates discussed in the text are marked: A) 500 BC, early (natural) forest disturbance,
possible Roman lead peak; B) AD 950, start of continual forest disturbance including anthropogenic indicators; C) AD 1180, start of ore processing as indicated by charcoal and lead
(concentration increase and decline in 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratio).

R. Bindler et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 38 (2011) 291e300

decline in isotope ratio is found throughout much of Europe
(Renberg et al., 2001; Cloy et al., 2008), although the precise timing
depends on proximity to speciﬁc source regions and their somewhat varying histories of mining during the Roman period. We can
reasonably interpret that the same changes in lead in Noren at
115 cm depth correspond to this time (Fig. 2A). After the 3rd century
AD lead concentrations and stable isotope ratios gradually return
to approximately background values in both sediment records.
Beginning c. AD 960 (sample interval spans AD 945e975) there
are changes in Kalven’s sediment record that indicate anthropogenic impacts, which we can only identify as regional in origin. At
this point there is a small increase (3 mg Pb g1) in the lead
concentration together with a signiﬁcant decline in the 206Pb/207Pb
ratio, from 1.473 to 1.397. Based on a simple two-component lead
isotope mixing model (Farmer et al., 1996; Bindler et al., 2008,
2009) this change in lead composition in Kalven can only be
explained by the addition of a lead source having a low 206Pb/207Pb
ratio of about 1.00e1.05, i.e., a lead isotope ratio characteristic of
Bergslagen ores. No corresponding changes in lead composition are
observable in Noren, possibly due to the lower resolution subsampling.
During the period c. AD 1150e1250 lead concentrations increase
by more than 20 mg Pb g1 and 206Pb/207Pb ratios decline to 1.27 in
Kalven. In Noren the concentration increase is somewhat lower,
12e13 mg Pb g1, and 206Pb/207Pb ratios decline to w1.32. A greater
change in lead composition occurs from c. 1490. The increases in
lead concentrations at this time in both Kalven and Noren are
accompanied by the lowest 206Pb/207Pb ratios in the two lakes of
1.142 and 1.176, respectively. Based on a three-component mixing
model (Bindler et al., 2009), about 40% of the pollution lead in the
sediment from Noren but as much as 90% in Kalven is derived from
Bergslagen ores at this time.
In Noren concentrations of lithogenic elements such as
rubidium, strontium and zirconium decline gradually from the
deepest, oldest sediments (437 cm depth) upwards to 75 cm (c. AD
940), which are related largely to a long-term, almost two-fold
increase in organic matter content (R2 ¼ 0.94, 0.93 and 0.96,
respectively, for the three elements versus carbon content). These
trends are an expected response to a gradual landscape development following deglaciation. For the trace metals (e.g., arsenic,
copper, mercury, zinc), concentrations are stable from about 6000
years ago until c. AD 1200. During the period from AD 1200 until c.
1500 the concentrations of the lithogenic elements increase by
50%; for example, strontium increases from 45e50 to 65e70 mg g1
and zirconium from 55e60 to 90e100 mg g1. For major and trace
metals there are slight increases during the early to mid-1400s, but
more signiﬁcantly the concentrations of, for example, arsenic,
copper and zinc increase by two to three-fold and mercury by 10fold (as well as other trace elements not shown here, such as
germanium and yttrium) from just c. 1470 (41e42 cm depth) to
1500 (39e40 cm).
3.5. Lead in the Lapphyttan peat record
For the deepest samples from the Lapphyttan peat record the
Pb/207Pb ratios are characterized by high values typical for
sediments and soils, 1.62, and concentrations that are low,
3e5 mg Pb g1 (Fig. 4). The isotope ratio gradually declines upwards
towards the surface to values of 1.1e1.13. The initial decline is
related to a declining proportion of natural lead derived from
surrounding soils. We can speculate that the decline in 206Pb/207Pb
ratios to 1.40 and the small increase in lead concentration to
12 mg g1 about AD 1 are related to the Roman lead peak seen
typically in lakes and bogs throughout Sweden and Europe. A more
signiﬁcant change occurs by c. AD 1180 when the 206Pb/207Pb ratio

297

declines and the lead concentration increases three-fold from 8 to
24 mg g1. Based on the simple two-component lead isotope mixing
model this change in lead composition from this time period
onward reﬂects an addition of a mixed lead source having a low
206
Pb/207Pb ratio in the range 1.02e1.15, reﬂecting some contribution of lead derived from Bergslagen ores.
4. Discussion: early land use and iron mining in Norberg
4.1. Pre-AD 960
Prior to AD 960 there is no evidence of local impacts either from
mining or from land use. The most signiﬁcant feature is the wellestablished peak in lead pollution about AD 80, which is attributed
to the long-range atmospheric transport of lead emitted from
Roman mining and metallurgy in mainland Europe. This peak in
lead and the accompanying decline in the 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratio
is found throughout much of Europe (Renberg et al., 2001; Cloy
et al., 2008), although the precise timing depends on proximity to
speciﬁc source regions and their somewhat varying histories of
mining during the Roman period.
4.2. AD 960
Beginning about AD 960 (945e975) there are changes in Kalven’s sediment record that indicate anthropogenic impacts, which
we can identify as local in origin, but not likely in direct connection
to the lake. The decline in the 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratio in Kalven
indicates that there was a small input of lead (3 mg Pb g1) to the
sediment that can only be explained by an addition of lead derived
from Bergslagen ores (206Pb/207Pb ¼ 1.024). A number of archaeological sites have been noted in lakes upstream of Kalven, such as in
the villages of Fliken, Fragg and Gäsjö, where smelting houses are
documented from at least 1539 (Petterson, 1994). Further evidence
that the source was local and upstream of Kalven is that we observe
no corresponding changes in lead composition in Noren nor in peat
records from ombrotrophic bogs to the south, such as Limbergsmosse, which is only 40 km to the southwest of Norberg. These
ombrotrophic peat records, which receive lead only via atmospheric deposition, indicate that there was no contribution of lead
from Bergslagen ores to the regional atmospheric lead signal
(Bindler et al., 2009); rather, atmospheric lead deposition is characterized by a lead isotopic composition that is dominated by
long-range transported lead from mainland Europe.
Because there are no changes observed in the sediment properties of Kalven (e.g., varve thickness and magnetic susceptibility),
no signiﬁcant changes in the pollen assemblage besides the
appearance of one rye pollen grain, and no changes in sediment
geochemistry in Noren, we can only conclude that the limited
evidence for mining activities and cultivation that we can read from
the data indicate that these activities did not occur in the area
immediately surrounding Kalven or Noren. Given that there is
a lead isotopic signal in Kalven, but not Noren, we hypothesize that
whatever mining or metal processing took place was upstream of
Kalven, which would act as a sedimentation basin above Noren.

206

4.3. AD 1050e1250
Changes in the pollen assemblage during the period from AD
1050 to 1250 indicate the establishment of human settlements in
the general area surrounding Kalven (Fig. 3). These changes are
primarily in the form of an increased number of pollen from grasses
and heather, which are plants favored by disturbance. The increase
in these pollen types coincide with a small increase in charcoal
particles and an absence of juniper, which is disfavored by ﬁre in

298

R. Bindler et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 38 (2011) 291e300

contrast to heather. Together these changes are indicative of
burning and forest grazing. In central Sweden forest grazing often
took place at a distance from permanent settlements, hence the
lack of other cultural pollen taxa in the sediment record at this time
(Segerström and Emanuelsson, 2002). The lack of changes in other
sediment properties in the lake suggests this activity was small
scale or at least not in direct connection to the lake. Similarly, the
charcoal and pollen data from Lapphyttan indicate human-related
forest disturbance during the period from ca. AD 970 to 1180, after
which there is a complete loss of deciduous trees (Fig. 4). Together
the two pollen records suggest a pattern of increasing settlement in
the region, which occurred together with or possibly slightly prior
to mining. This close interaction of settlement and land use with
mining and metallurgy is well established in other regions of
Europe (Monna et al., 2004a; Martínez Cortizas et al., 2005).
In regards to evidence of mining and metallurgy, archaeological
studies in the Norberg mining district and other districts suggest
that the 13th century was an important period of establishment for
mining, with expansion continuing through the 14th and 15th
centuries (Petterson Jensen, 2002). Our peat record from Lapphyttan, taken from the small mire immediately below the blast
furnace site, support the late 12th century start for the furnace as
indicated by radiocarbon dating from archaeological studies. The
sharp rise in charcoal and the change in lead composition (increase
in concentration and decline in 206Pb/207Pb) about AD 1185 provide
clear evidence for ore processing at this site. The charcoal and
pollen data suggest that local land-use changes may already have
begun from c. AD 930, but we can only speculate as to whether the
slight decline in the 206Pb/207Pb ratio at this time is indicative of ore
processing at the site. We have no lead analyses between 930 and
1185, but certainly from this latter date the decline in the
206
Pb/207Pb ratio indicates an addition of lead from Bergslagen ores.
In the two sediment records the only signiﬁcant changes
occurring at this time are in Noren c. AD 1200, where there is an
increase in lithogenic elements (e.g., zirconium as well as other
elements not shown including rubidium, strontium and titanium)
and a decline in organic matter. These changes are accompanied
only by an increase in lead concentrations along with an increase in
Pb/Ti and Pb/Zr ratios. As with lead isotopes, the enrichment in lead
versus the two lithogenic elements indicates an ore source for this
lead. We hypothesize that the increase in the lithogenic elements is
related to the start of mining; given that mines at Klackberg are on
the southern side of the ridge facing towards Noren, away from
Kalven, it is logical that the impact would register in the sediments
of Noren rather than Kalven. This hypothesis is supported by the
fact that Norberg’s mines were mentioned in the deed of exchange
between Tyrgils Knutsson and Birger Magnusson AD 1303. Further
support is provided by the major changes in sediment properties in
Kalven that follow from 1296 as discussed below.
4.4. AD 1250e1400
After 1250 more signiﬁcant changes occur in the sediment
record from Kalven, which indicate more direct human settlement
and also metallurgy in close physical proximity to the lake. From
this date the pollen assemblage includes an increase in diverse
cereal pollens, hemp and other plants favored by disturbance,
which together indicate cultivation.
The more signiﬁcant and unequivocal change occurs about AD
1295 in Kalven’s sediment record. From this point there is an
unambiguous increase in varve thickness, from 0.55  0.5 mm yr1
to 0.80 mm yr1 (Fig. 3), which is accompanied by a sharp
increase in magnetic susceptibility, changes towards lighter color in
the varves and a large increase in charcoal particles. Given the
proximity of our coring site to the inlet stream with the newly

identiﬁed, but undated blast furnace site we can reasonably
hypothesize that the increase in magnetic susceptibility and large
charcoal particles are due to establishment of this furnace. That this
was a blast furnace is suggested by its streamside location, the
presence of ﬁning heaps and slag, and the substantial inﬁlling of the
stream inlet. This late 13th century date coincides with the establishment of a number of other blast furnaces in the region
surrounding the Norberg mining district at this time (Petterson
Jensen, 2002). The increasing level of organization of iron production in the Norberg mining district from the late 13th century was
clearly an important contribution to the rise of iron as an export
product; osmund iron is ﬁrst mentioned in a document listing
exports in 1368, when osmund iron (200 ton) comprised one-third
of the export from Stockholm to the Hansa city of Lübeck (Olsson,
2007). However, based on the magnetic susceptibility data the
furnace site at the stream inlet site in the village of Flängen may
have been short-lived and was active only into the middle of the
14th century; only the site further upstream a few hundred meters
away was documented during the late 16th century.
4.5. AD 1400 and onward
From about 1400 onwards, and especially from the end of the
1400s, mining and metallurgical activities must have been the
dominant feature of the landscape of Norberg and its surroundings.
There are smaller changes in varve appearance in Kalven during the
14th and much of the 15th centuries, but there is a very distinct
change to a lighter color AD 1490. At this time the lead concentrations in both Kalven and Noren are accompanied by their lowest
206
Pb/207Pb ratios, 1.142 and 1.176, respectively. Based on a threecomponent mixing model (Bindler et al., 2009), about 40% of the
pollution lead in the sediment from Noren and as much as 90% in
Kalven is derived from Bergslagen ores at this time. The greater
inﬂuence of ore lead on Kalven’s sediment record as compared to
Noren we attribute to the known blast furnace sites in villages
upstream of Kalven. The outlet from Kalven to Noren is at the
eastern end of the lake, and much of the ﬂuvial emission of metals
from the stream to the lake would have sedimented in the deep
(20 m) western basin.
In Noren the concentration of mining metals begins to increase
about AD 1430 (44e45 cm depth), but the more signiﬁcant increase
occurs from the sample estimated to c. AD 1470 to the following
sample c. 1500; i.e., coinciding in time with the distinct sediment
layers of 1492e1493 in Kalven. The sediment also becomes more
reddish-brown in color. The increase in metals includes both the
major ore metals, iron and manganese, and trace metals such as
arsenic, copper, lead, mercury, yttrium and zinc. The mercury
increase is speciﬁc to Noren and not Kalven, which indicates the
source was local to only Noren.
In the top 30 cm of the surface freeze core from Noren, which
corresponds to the period from AD 1600 to the present, there are
some laminations present in the sediment, but which are visibly
turbated. The laminations indicate that emissions to the lake
signiﬁcantly altered water quality, such that extensive periods of
oxygen-free bottom waters must have occurred (a necessary
condition for the formation of laminations and varves in boreal
lakes).
The lead record from two ombrotrophic bogs to the south of
Norberg, Limbergsmosse 40 km to the southwest and Dumme
mosse (Småland), which is 200 km to the south, indicate that
atmospheric pollution in central Sweden e although dominated by
mainland European lead sources (w85%) e must have included an
in-mixing of Bergslagen sources (w15%) from about AD 1500
(Bindler et al., 2009). Thus the main impact of the metal emissions
from mining and metallurgy in Norberg and Bergslagen as a whole

R. Bindler et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 38 (2011) 291e300

was largely in the form of direct emissions to recipient watercourses and lakes that were hydrologically connected to speciﬁc
sites.
5. Conclusions
Based on our data from Lapphyttan and from Kalven, mining
and ore processing in the Norberg mining district were established
in the region during the period from the late 12th to late 13th
centuries. Our data from the mire record at Lapphyttan support the
earliest suggested dates for the establishment of the furnace at that
site. Furthermore, we can unequivocally conclude that the recently
identiﬁed blast furnace site was established along the inlet stream
at the eastern end of Kalven about AD 1296; we speculate that the
changes in the geochemical record from Noren during the period
from c. AD 1200 to 1300 was related to mining, because logically
establishment of a blast furnace should follow the discovery of the
necessary ore to feed the furnace. However, our lead data from
Kalven suggest that there were some mining or metallurgy related
activities as early as c. AD 950, but not in immediate proximity to
the lake. This slight change in lead composition is followed by
changes in the pollen assemblage that indicate forest grazing. It
would seem that early mining and early land use are relatively
synchronous. At Lapphyttan indicators of human disturbance
precede (AD 950e1180) the evidence for ore processing at this site,
which appears in the form of a large increase in charcoal particles
paired with a change in lead composition c. AD 1180 e but we lack
geochemical analyses in this important time period from 950 to
1180 to fully support the good evidence provided by charcoal
particles. Taken together, the results from our study support the
limited number of documents from the 14th century, which indicate the development of mining and metallurgy industry in the
Norberg mining district was already well underway during the 13th
century, which is increasingly well supported by data derived from
archaeological studies in the region.
In the future we hope that high-resolution analyses of the
sediment record from Kalven along with planned excavations of the
furnace site on the western inlet to the lake, as well as studies in
other historically important mining areas, will further improve the
understanding of the early developments of iron mining in Sweden.
