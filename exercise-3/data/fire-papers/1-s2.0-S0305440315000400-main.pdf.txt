The single grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology for the sedimentary deposit at
Diepkloof Rockshelter, reported by Jacobs et al. (2008c), has recently been critiqued and several reasons
proposed for why the OSL ages for the Intermediate and Early Howieson's Poort (HP) and Still Bay (SB)
techno-complexes might be inaccurate. Tribolo et al. (2013) presented a series of OSL and thermoluminescence (TL) ages that were in agreement with each other, but, for some part of the sequence at least,
were much older than the OSL chronology of Jacobs et al. (2008c). In this paper, we have tested the
criticisms of Tribolo et al. (2013) and colleagues related to both the equivalent dose (De) estimates and
the beta dose rates by performing a series of targeted experiments, combined with updates and reassessments of our error calculations. We show that the De estimates are stable over a range of alternative measurement conditions and also over time. We also demonstrate the reproducibility of our
measurement procedures for the beta dose rates, and their accuracy tested against a range of independently obtained estimates. We show that, for the stratigraphic units (SUs) where there are major
discrepancies in age between Jacobs et al. (2008c) and Tribolo et al. (2013)dnotably the Intermediate HP
and Early HPdand for which both studies had single grain OSL ages, the estimation of potassium (K) in
the sediment surrounding the dated grains is critical. We provide new and updated De and dose rate
estimates, and ﬁnal ages which we compare with our previous age estimates and those of Tribolo et al.
(2013). The differences in the size of the errors associated with the ages reported in the two independent
studies are also addressed. We can show that our ages are robust and consistent with the original
chronology, but we cannot satisfactorily explain why the TL and OSL ages provided by Tribolo et al. (2013)
might be wrong. So, the dating conundrum at Diepkloof Rockshelter remains. As a result, we caution
against the development of HP and SB age models based on only one of the chronologies for this site. At
this stage, extrapolation of the Tribolo et al. (2013) chronology to a re-interpretation of the southern
African MSA would appear to be premature, especially as the ages do not differ systematically between
the two studies and as differences between TL and OSL ages are not an issue at other sites in southern
Africa where both dating methods have been applied. Further work is needed to resolve the question of
the Diepkloof chronology.

1. Introduction
In a recent compilation of papers in a Special issue of this journal,
the previously published single grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology for Diepkloof Rockshelter, presented in
Jacobs et al. (2008c), was called to question. Tribolo et al. (2013)
proposed a new chronology based on measurement of both thermoluminescence (TL) and isothermal TL (ITL) dating of burnt stones,

and single grain OSL dating of sedimentary quartz grains. They obtained consistent results between their TL/ITL and OSL chronologies,
but some of their resultsdnotably those within the middle of the
technological and lithological sequencedare inconsistent with the
single grain OSL chronology of Jacobs et al. (2008c). The latter
chronology was, therefore, dismissed by all papers in this Special
Issue, and excluded from the new chrono-stratigraphy proposed for
the site, which was then used to interpret all aspects of the site,
including its technological and typological sequences and the implications for understanding the MSA of southern Africa.
rin et al. (2013) made a number of
Tribolo et al. (2013) and Gue
suggestions as to why the single grain OSL chronology of Jacobs et al.

The ﬁlled circles represent the ages for individual samples obtained from OSL dating of
single quartz grains by Jacobs et al. (2008c). The DRS numbers at the left are the
sample names used by Jacobs et al. (2008c). The open symbols denote the weighted
mean TL and/or ITL ages on burnt stones (squares) and individual OSL ages on single
quartz grains (triangles) by Tribolo et al. (2013). The technological phases at the right
are those provided by Porraz et al. (2013). Note that DRS13 was previously assigned to
the SB, but is now associated with the EHP (Porraz et al., 2013, p. 3386).

(2008c) may be wrong. Tribolo et al. (2013) expressed concerns that
the single grain equivalent dose (De) estimates may have been in
error because ‘dose recovery tests’ were conducted on multi-grain
aliquots and not on single grains. Such tests are routinely carried
out to establish the most suitable measurement conditions for the

rin et al.
samples under investigation (Galbraith et al., 1999). Gue
(2013) raised some objections about our application of the ﬁnite
mixture model (FMM) to single grain OSL measurements. They also
criticised our methods for estimating the beta-particle dose rate, in
particular 1) the small size of the uncertainties attached to the betaparticle contribution to the environmental dose rate for some of the
samples, including those from Diepkloof; and 2) the details of
implementation of a model proposed by Jacobs et al. (2008b) to
adjust the beta dose rate in speciﬁc circumstances. Tribolo et al.
(2013) also commented on these two issues, but indicated that
these were insufﬁcient to explain the age discrepancies. Tribolo et al.
(2009) had previously also criticised our use of laboratory measurements to estimate the gamma dose rates at Diepkloof, but
showed that this was not the source of the age discrepancy.
All of these criticisms and their potential effects on the calculated ages of the samples are testable. In this paper, we scrutinise
the effects that the issues raised may have on our single grain OSL
chronology for Diepkloof, and re-assess our previously published
ages. We also present new De and dose rate data for all of the
samples to explicitly test the criticisms raised. In the light of our
new results, we compare our updated chronology with that
developed by Tribolo et al. (2013).
2. Current luminescence chronologies for Diepkloof
Rockshelter
In 2008, we published single grain OSL ages for 13 samples from
Diepkloof (Jacobs et al., 2008c). These are shown in Fig. 1 together
with the weighted mean TL or ITL and individual OSL samples
presented in Tribolo et al. (2005, 2009, 2013). The samples of Jacobs
et al. (2008c) were collected by the ﬁrst author from two different
sectors (Fig. 2). In the absence of stratigraphic connections between
the different excavated sectors in the site (Parkington et al., 2013),

Fig. 2. Schematic of Diepkloof Rockshelter and the excavation plan marked in black (modiﬁed from Parkington et al., 2013). Each square represents 1 m2. The two red areas
represent those parts of the excavation from which OSL samples were collected for the study of Jacobs et al. (2008c) and this study. The blue areas represent the excavated areas
from which samples were collected for the TL and OSL studies of Tribolo et al. (2013). The red and blue shading in squares L6 and M6 indicates an overlap in sampling area between
the two studies. The green shading in the ‘Back’ sector indicates the approximate position of the section wall from which samples were collected by Feathers and Woodborne
(Tribolo, 2003). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

Z. Jacobs, R.G. Roberts / Journal of Archaeological Science 63 (2015) 175e192

we consider it critical to understand where the samples were
collected from in order to correctly interpret the ages and make
meaningful comparisons. The uppermost samples (DRS4 to DRS9)
were all collected from squares C6 and D6 in the ‘Trench’ sector
(Fig. 2) and are representative of the post-HP (DRS8 and 9) and Late
HP (DRS4 to DRS7) technological phases, as deﬁned by Porraz et al.
(2013). None of the ages presented in Tribolo et al. (2013) were for
samples from this sector; instead all their samples for the post-HP
and Late HP were from the ‘Back’ sector (Fig. 2). Samples were also
previously collected in the late 1990s from the ‘Back’ sector by
Feathers and Woodborne (Tribolo, 2003, Fig. 2), but those remain
unpublished. The remaining samples (DRS10 to DRS17) were
collected from squares L6 and M6 in the ‘Main’ sector (Fig. 2) and
represent some, but not all, of the remaining technological phases
e Late HP (DRS10), Intermediate HP (DRS11), Early HP (DRS13), Still
Bay (DRS14) and Lower MSA (DRS15 to DRS17). Note that the current technological phases were not yet established in 2008, but,
apart from one sample (DRS13), this has not made a considerable
difference. DRS13 (collected from SU Kerry) was originally assigned
by the excavators to the SB, but has since been re-assigned to the
Early HP (Porraz et al., 2013, p. 3386 and Tribolo et al., 2013, p.
3409). The relative positions of most of the samples from these two
areas are shown in Fig. 3, on the stratigraphic drawings presented
in Parkington et al. (2013). The stratigraphic drawing of the north
face in the ‘Main’ sector is for squares N6 and O6, but the OSL
samples were collected from squares L6 and M6, for which a
photograph is also shown in Fig. 3 (lower panels). From this ﬁgure,
it is clear that there is a higher density of samples in the upper
levels of the ‘Trench’ sector (upper panels in Fig. 3), than in the
‘Main’ sector.
The dating conundrum is evident in Fig. 1. Jacobs et al. (2008c)
presented a chronology that started from ~48 ka for the post-HP
in the ‘Trench’ sector, gradually increasing in age through the HP
and the SB to ~90 ka at the base in the Lower MSA of the ‘Main’
Sector. Tribolo et al. (2013) reported a chronology that shows some
consistency with our chronology at the top (LHP) and bottom
(Lower MSA) of the sequence, but not for the middle. Their
weighted mean age (65 ± 8 ka) for the intermediate HP (IHP) of the
‘Back’ sector (in SU OB5) is consistent with the age (63 ± 2 ka)
obtained for the IHP by Jacobs et al. (2008c) from sample DRS11,
which was collected from the interface of SUs John and Jeff near the
base of the IHP in the ‘Main’ sector. By contrast, the ages of Tribolo
et al. (2013) for the IHP from SUs Fred and Fox in the ‘Main’ sector
(Fig. 3) are signiﬁcantly older, but their weighted mean age for
lowest SU John (77 ± 8 ka) is consistent at 2s with our age for the
same SU (65 ± 8 ka). Signiﬁcantly different ages from those presented in Jacobs et al. (2008c) were also obtained by Tribolo et al.
(2013) for the EHP and the SB; ages for the latter pair are between 30 and 35 ka older than the corresponding OSL ages presented by Jacobs et al. (2008c). (We note that the weighted mean
age of 105 ± 10 ka provided in Table 3 of Tribolo et al. (2013) is
incorrect and should be 100.5 ± 9.7 ka). The ages of Tribolo et al.
(2013) for the Lower MSA are systematically older than those
provided by Jacobs et al. (2008c), but are statistically consistent at
2s. Perhaps the most important discrepancy between the two
studies is the lack of correlation between the two sets of single
grain OSL ages. Those obtained by Tribolo et al. (2013) are consistent with their TL/ITL ages, which led them to suggest that the
single grain OSL ages presented by Jacobs et al. (2008c) are ﬂawed.
3. Optical dating
In the next few sections, we will scrutinise our data and test the
data sets according to the suggestions made by Tribolo et al. (2013)
rin et al. (2013). But before doing so, it is worthwhile to
and Gue

177

remind the reader about optical dating of quartz grains. There are
two parts of the OSL age equation:

Age ðkaÞ ¼

Equivalent dose; De ðGyÞ
 
Environmental dose rate Gy
ka

Aspects of both parts of the equation have been criticised as
regards their implementation by Jacobs et al. (2008c).
The numerator, De, represents the radiation energy absorbed by
the quartz grains since they were last exposed to sunlight
(‘bleached’) or heated to a high temperature, and stored as trapped
electrons. The De is estimated from measurements of the OSL signal
emitted by individual grains or by single aliquots composed of
many grains. The bleaching and burial history of an individual grain
is the smallest meaningful unit of analysis in OSL dating (Jacobs and
Roberts, 2007; Duller, 2008).
The denominator in the age equation is the environmental dose
rate, which consists of four separate contributions: the betaparticle and gamma-ray dose rates from materials surrounding
the quartz grains by up to ~3 mm and ~30 cm, respectively, and
lesser contributions from cosmic rays and alpha particles (the latter
emitted by radioactive inclusions internal to the quartz grains).

4. Assessing the equivalent dose (De) values
4.1. Dose recovery tests
All of the ages presented in Jacobs et al. (2008c) were based on
the measurement of many individual grains of quartz that were all
treated in an identical manner. This included a preheat temperature
of 260  C for 10 s prior to measurement of all natural and regenerative dose signals (PH-1), a preheat temperature of 220  C for 5 s
prior to all test dose measurements (PH-2), and a high temperature
optical stimulation with blue light-emitting diodes at 280  C for
40 s (‘hot’ wash) to empty out all remaining charge from the
electron traps at the end of each measurement (Lx/Tx) cycle (Wintle
and Murray, 2006; Jacobs et al., 2006b). The same OSL instrument
was used to measure all the samples, so the equivalent dose (De)
values are directly comparable. The measurement parameters were
established based on dose recovery tests. A dose recovery test
(Galbraith et al., 1999; Roberts et al., 1999) is a controlled laboratory
experiment in which grains from a sample are ﬁrst exposed to
natural sunlight for several days (or artiﬁcial light for shorter periods), and then stored in the dark for several days before being
given a known laboratory dose using a 90Sr/90Y beta source; the
latter is built into the OSL measurement equipment and is used to
administer radiation doses to grains to construct their dose
response curves. Ideally, the given dose is similar to the expected De
value for that sample of grains. The grains are then measured in the
same way as for the natural sample, using the single aliquot
regenerative-dose (SAR) measurement procedure (Murray and
Wintle, 2000) applying the same preheat and other measurement
parameters, with the aim to accurately measure (‘recover’) the dose
given to the sample. The results are usually expressed as a ratio of
the measured dose to the given dose. The idea behind the test is
that if the known dose can be ‘recovered’ (a measured/given dose
rate within experimental error of unity), then this provides an
indication that the laboratory procedures and measurement parameters are appropriate to create an accurate dose response curve
for the grains from that sample (Galbraith et al., 1999). A ratio of
unity, however, is not an assurance that the ‘natural’ dose (i.e., the
De) will be measured with accuracy as other factors can also inﬂuence the natural dose and as laboratory conditions are not

identical to those in the ﬁeld (Galbraith et al., 2005; Galbraith and
Roberts, 2012).
Jacobs et al. (2008c) performed a dose recovery test on 3 of the
Diepkloof samples (DRS5, DRS10 and DRS12) using six multi-grain
aliquots, each consisting of ~10 grains, for each sample (Table S2 in
Jacobs et al., 2008c). They obtained a measured/given dose ratio of
0.99 ± 0.03 and interpreted this positive result as suggesting that
the measurement conditions tested were appropriate to use for OSL
dating of individual grains from all 13 Diepkloof samples.
Tribolo et al. (2013) performed dose recovery tests using a range
of different preheat combinations to establish the best measurement conditions for their sediment samples (Table 2 in Tribolo
et al., 2013). One of their preheat combinations was the same as
that used by Jacobs et al. (2008c), namely a PH-1 of 260  C for 10 s, a
PH-2 of 220  C for 5 s and a blue LED stimulation for 40 s at 280  C
(‘hot’ wash) at the end of each measurement cycle. Using this
combination, they successfully recovered the known dose for two
of their samples from SUs Fox and Jude/Joy (both from the IHP), but
were unable to recover a known dose for 5 of 8 samples collected
from SUs Kenny (SB), Lynn/Leo (pre-SB), Mike, Maggy and Noel
(Lower MSA). The sample collected from SU Jess (EHP) gave a result
that was on the margins of acceptability (measured/given dose
ratio of 0.92 ± 0.03). This poor performance of the dose recovery
test on samples from the lower part of the ‘Main’ sector led them to
conclude that the measurement conditions used by Jacobs et al.
(2008c) for the samples from the deepest SUs, including John
(IHP), Kerry (EHP) and Logan (SB), were probably inappropriate and
that the De values were likely to have been underestimated by at
least 10%. They also strongly recommended that a dose recovery
test should be performed for each Diepkloof sample.
4.2. New single grain OSL dose recovery tests
To address this issue and to test the effect that alternative
measurement conditions may have on our De values, we have
conducted a series of dose recovery tests on single grains from all
our samples. We ﬁrst exposed a sub-set of grains from each sample
to natural sunlight for several days and then gave these grains a
known beta dose of ~100 Gy, similar to the measured De values for
our samples. We then measured between 300 and 500 grains from
each sample using the experimental parameters used in Jacobs
et al. (2008c). The results are presented in Fig. 4, where the
measured/given dose ratio is plotted for each of the samples,
together with the number of grains used to estimate the ratio and
the ‘overdispersion’ (OD); the OD is the amount of scatter
remaining among the dose estimates for a particular sample after
all measurement uncertainties have been taken into account
(Galbraith and Roberts, 2012). The broken line indicates a ratio of
unity and the two stippled lines mark the ±5% limits. Ten of the 13
samples have measured/given dose ratios that are within 5% of
unity and are considered to be acceptable. The three samples that
failed the dose recovery test under these measurement conditions
are DRS7 (0.92 ± 0.02) from SU Helen (LHP) and DRS15 (0.89 ± 0.02)
and DRS17 (0.79 ± 0.04) from SUs Mark and the interface of Nina/
Nel, respectively, both from the Lower MSA. Our samples from the
IHP, EHP and SB performed well, and do not show the same signiﬁcant underestimation as that observed by Tribolo et al. (2013).
We next tried a different set of dose recovery test conditions,
and were able to satisfactorily recover the given dose for samples
DRS7 (0.97 ± 0.02; N ¼ 187; OD ¼ 14 ± 2), DRS15 (1.02 ± 0.02;
N ¼ 184; OD ¼ 13 ± 1%) and DRS17 (1.02 ± 0.04; N ¼ 44;
OD ¼ 15 ± 3%) using a PH-1 of 260  C for 10 s, a PH-2 of 160  C for
10 s and a 60 s optical stimulation at 125  C with blue LEDs at the
end of each measurement cycle (i.e., a ‘cold’ wash). This outcome is
consistent with that reported by Tribolo et al. (2013) for their three

samples from the Lower MSA. To err on the side of caution, we also
conducted a series of dose recovery tests using a range of alternative measurement parameters for the three critical samples from
the IHP (DRS11), EHP (DRS13) and SB (DRS14). These results are
presented in Fig. 5aec. All three samples show some sensitivity to
changes in the preheat combinations, but these plots also show that
the preheat combination used by Jacobs et al. (2008c) does not
result in signiﬁcant underestimation of the known dose. It is also
interesting that the range of OD values does not change signiﬁcantly with the different dose recovery test combinations. We
interpret the OD to be the result of inherent differences (natural
variation) in the physical behaviour of the grains, such that not all
grains in any particular sample respond identically to the same
measurement conditions, and that this should be taken into
consideration when interpreting the De distributions of the natural
samples.
4.3. Sensitivity of the natural signal to changes in preheat
temperature
The dose recovery test may not completely reﬂect the determination of the natural dose, because of a number of differences
between radiation doses received by the grains in nature and those
given in the laboratory and various time-dependent phenomena.
Foremost are the differences in delivery rate of the dose, storage
time between irradiation and OSL measurement, and the possibility
of phenomena such as trap and recombination centre stability and/
or competition. The time-dependent effects cannot be reproduced
in the laboratory and they should be kept in mind when interpreting dose recovery test results (Murray et al., 2002; Galbraith
et al., 2005). So, we have also measured the natural signal of the
three most important samples (DRS11, 13 and 14) using a range of
alternative preheat combinations.
4.3.1. DRS11 e interface of SUs Jeff and John in the IHP
The results for DRS11 are displayed in Fig. 6a and d. Apart from
one preheat combination (PH-1 ¼ 260  C for 10 s and PH-2 ¼ 220  C
for 5 s without a ‘hot’ wash), all of the other combinations produced
De values that are statistically consistent. We have, therefore,
combined the latter values to obtain a ‘new’ weighted mean De
value of 124.3 ± 3.4 Gy, which is consistent with the ‘old’ weighted
mean De value of 125.2 ± 2.2 Gy; the weighted mean and 2s errors

180

corresponding overdispersion values are 24 ± 5% and 0%. Hence, the
use of the ‘fast ratio’ as a rejection criterion has a negligible effect
on both the weighted mean De value and the De overdispersion,
although less precise De estimates were obtained owing to the large
reduction in the number of accepted De values, as reported previously for other sites (Duller, 2012; Jacobs et al., 2013).
The consistency in De values allows us to statistically combine
the ‘old’ and ‘new’ De value data sets to obtain a ‘grand’ weighted
mean De of 124.2 ± 1.9 Gy (OD ¼ 24.7 ± 1.4%), which we now use for
age determination of this sample. The radial plot containing all ‘old’
and ‘new’ De values are presented in Fig. 6d, where the grey band is
centred on the grand weighted mean De value. Tribolo et al. (2013)
presented single grain OSL ages for two sediment samples from the
SUs that overlie (SU Fox; DRS-OSL8) and underlie (SU Jude/Joy;
DRS-OSL7) the SU from which our sample was collected (the
interface of SUs Jeff and John). They obtained similar De values for
their two samples (115.8 ± 3.8 and 116.0 ± 3.1 Gy, respectively),
which are also consistent with the De values obtained for our
sample (Fig. 6a). These samples are not, strictly speaking, directly
comparable, since our sample was collected from the face of square
L6, into square M6, whereas their samples were collected from the
face of square O6, ~2 m away (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the overall
concordance of results indicates that we obtain similar De values to
Tribolo et al. (2013) using the same measurement conditions for
samples from the IHP and the underlying MSA-Jack.

are displayed as broken lines in Fig. 6a and were calculated using
the Central Age Model (CAM) of Galbraith et al. (1999). We also
calculated ‘fast ratios’ (Durcan and Duller, 2011; Duller, 2012) for all
the newly measured grains for which De values could be calculated,
following the approach explained in Jacobs et al. (2013). For grains
with fast ratios >10 and >20, the respective CAM De values are
122.7 ± 7.1 Gy (N ¼ 33) and 117.2 ± 7.0 Gy (N ¼ 15) and the

4.3.2. DRS13 e interface of SUs Kate and Kenny in the EHP
The results for DRS13 are presented in Fig. 6b and e. All preheat
combinations resulted in De values that are consistent, giving a
combined ‘new’ De value of 104 ± 2 Gy. For grains with (high) fast
ratios >10 and >20, the respective CAM De values are 98.6 ± 4.0 Gy
(N ¼ 83) and 95.0 ± 7.0 Gy (N ¼ 18) and the corresponding overdispersion values are 29 ± 3% and 25 ± 6%. This ‘new’ weighted
mean De value is ~10% lower than the ‘old’ weighted mean De of
116 ± 2 Gy, whereas the weighted mean De values from the grains
with high fast ratios are ~15e18% lower. We cannot explain this
difference, and have no objective criterion to favour one value over
the other. We have, therefore, combined the ‘new’ and ‘old’ De data
sets to obtain a grand weighted mean De of 108.3 ± 1.3 Gy, with an
OD value of 25.9 ± 1.1% (the effect on age is also discussed below);
the individual De values are displayed as a radial plot in Fig. 6e. Also
shown in Fig. 6b is the De value obtained by Tribolo et al. (2013) for
their sample from SU Jess in the EHP (DRS-OSL6), the most closely
positioned sample to DRS13. They obtained a De value that is ~26%
higher than the grand weighted mean for DRS13, using a preheat
combination of 260  C for 10 s (PH-1), 220  C for 5 s (PH-2) and a
ﬁnal optical stimulation at 125  C for 60 s (i.e., a ‘cold’ wash). In
Fig. 5b, we showed that we could also satisfactorily recover the
known dose using this preheat combination (number 2), obtaining
a measured/given dose ratio of 1.04 ± 0.02. We also measured the
natural signal of 500 grains with this combination, and De values
could be calculated for 99 of these grains (Fig. 6b). The resulting
weighted mean De value of 99.8 ± 3.2 Gy (and an OD value of
26 ± 3%), is similar to that obtained for grains with high fast ratios,
but ~36% lower than that obtained by Tribolo et al. (2013). We
interpret this difference as a real effect and not the result of a
ﬂawed methodology as suggested by Tribolo et al. (2013). We must
keep in mind that DRS-OSL6 and DRS13 were not collected from the
same excavation face, so that differences in dose rate may be
responsible for some or all of the discrepancy between their
measured De values (see below).

values compared to the higher preheat temperatures. The small
range in weighted mean De values of between 90 ± 3 and 106 ± 5 Gy
is not considered signiﬁcant and, for two of these combinations, we
obtained successful dose recovery results (see Fig. 5c). When all
‘new’ De values are combined, a weighted mean De of 97 ± 1 Gy is
obtained. This is consistent with the ‘old’ weighted mean De value
of 100 ± 2 Gy and also with the weighted mean De values of
94.2 ± 3.5 Gy (N ¼ 89) and 95.2 ± 6.9 Gy (N ¼ 25) for grains with
fast ratios of >10 and >20 (OD values of 27 ± 3% and 31 ± 6%,
respectively). This allows us to combine the ‘new’ and ‘old’ data sets
to obtain a grand weighted mean De for age determination of
99 ± 1 Gy, with an OD value of 24 ± 1%; the individual De values,
numbering more than 1000, are displayed as a radial plot in Fig. 6f.
Tribolo et al. (2013) did not collect a sediment sample from the SB
for single grain OSL dating, so there are no data of theirs to compare
against.

4.4. Reproducibility of De values over time
We also re-measured seven of the samples (DRS4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10
and 11) for which successful dose recovery test results were obtained using our original preheat combination. The old and new
results are presented in Fig. 7a. The new De values measured in this
study are both higher and lower by up to ~5% compared to the
original De values, but they are statistically consistent at 1s, which
suggests that we can measure our De values reproducibly more
than 7 years apart. In Fig. 7b are the new De values for the three
samples (DRS7, DRS15 and DRS17) that failed the dose recovery test
using our original preheat conditions (see Fig. 4). A total of 1000
grains of each sample was measured using the preheat combination
that resulted in a successful dose recovery test on these samples
(PH-1 ¼ 260  C for 10 s; PH-2 ¼ 160  C for 10 s; ﬁnal optical
stimulation at 125  C for 60 s). None of the samples show a signiﬁcant change (<5%) between the De values measured >7 years
apart. Since all of the samples yielded statistically consistent ‘old’

circles. The combined De values (triangles), and the ratios of the ‘old’ versus the ‘new’

and ‘new’ De values, we have combined the two data sets to obtain
the grand weighted mean De values for age determination; these
are shown as triangles in Fig. 7a and b. For sample DRS16, we also
measured 2000 additional grains and calculated new De values
using two different preheat combinations: 180  C or 260  C for 10 s
(PH-1) and 180  C or 160  C for 10 s (PH-2), respectively. These two
combinations yielded De estimates that were statistically compatible (95.3 ± 6.0 Gy and 97.2 ± 3.7 Gy, respectively) and consistent
with the ‘old’ De value of 94.2 ± 2.4 Gy.
4.5. De distributions and interpretations
For all of the samples, the ‘new’ and ‘old De data sets have been
combined to obtain the ﬁnal De for age determination (Table 1).
Table S1 contains information about the total number of grains
measured, the number for which De values could be determined,
and the reasons for rejecting the remaining grains. The three
‘combined De'radial plots for DRS11, DRS13 and DRS14 are shown in
Fig. 6 and for the rest of the samples in Fig. S1. The radial plots of all
the ‘old’ De data sets are provided in Fig. S8 of Jacobs et al. (2008c).
In Jacobs et al. (2008c), we observed 4 different types of De
distribution, namely ‘well-bleached’, ‘scattered’, ‘mixed’ and ‘scattered and mixed’ (after Jacobs et al., 2008a). We applied the Central
Age Model (CAM) of Galbraith et al. (1999) to the ‘well-bleached’
samples (DRS15e17) to calculate the weighted mean De for each of
the samples. For the remaining 10 samples, we applied the Finite
Mixture Model (FMM) of Roberts et al. (2000) to the ‘scattered’
(DRS8, 6, 11 and 13), ‘mixed’ (DRS4 and 10) and ‘scattered and
mixed’ (DRS9, 5, 17 and 14) De distributions to calculate the
weighted mean De for the dominant component; that is, the population of grains with De values representative of the majority of
the grains. We also estimated the proportion of grains in that
population and optimised the OD value for that population using
the statistical criteria described by Galbraith (2005).
rin et al. (2013: 314) have suggested that Jacobs et al.
Gue
(2008c) chose between using CAM and FMM “based on a potentially subjective 20% limit on the dose overdispersion expected from
well-bleached quartz grains” and that this “limit was then used to
constrain the use of the FMM”. We never use an OD value of 20% as
the sole criterion for choosing between the CAM and any other age
model (e.g., the FMM or the minimum age model, MAM). Instead,
we routinely take several steps to assess the possible cause(s) of the
observed distribution of De values for any sample, as we have
explained in previous publications (e.g., Jacobs and Roberts, 2007;
Jacobs et al., 2008a, 2011, 2013). First, we calculate the OD value for
each sample using the CAM. OD values of up to 20% have been
commonly observed for many quartz samples from around the
world (Arnold and Roberts, 2009), so when OD values greater than
20% are obtained, we pay special attention to any additional features, but do not automatically apply the FMM or MAM. In Jacobs
et al. (2008c), the distinction between the CAM and FMM
happened to coincide with an OD value of ~20% or less. Second, we
make a visual assessment of the distribution pattern of De values in
a radial plot to identify whether a De distribution is composed of a
single population of values or multiple, discrete components, or if it
shows some other feature(s) of interest. Third, we apply our
knowledge of the site and sample contexts to pose questions about
the known depositional and post-depositional processes that could
result in the observed De distribution. These different strands of
evidence are then combined to develop a plausible scenario to
explain the De distribution for any particular sample and help us
decide which statistical model to use for age estimation.
When the FMM is chosen, we consistently use statistically
objective measures, namely the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC)
and the maximum log likelihood (llik), based on the

recommendations of Galbraith (2005). This allows us to determine
1) whether a De distribution consists of more than one discrete De
component, and 2) if more than one discrete De component can be
statistically supported, then the BIC and llik are used to determine,
for a range of tested alternatives, the number of components and
OD value, at which the model is optimised; an OD value of 20% is
not used to constrain the FMM. Readers may refer to the supporting
information in Jacobs et al. (2011) for a detailed explanation and
worked example of this approach, and to Galbraith and Roberts
(2012) for statistical details of model implementation. We maintain, therefore, that our implementation of the FMM is statistically
robust and appropriate.
The new combined De data sets, presented as radial plots in
Fig. 6 and Fig. S1, contain considerably more data than those published previously. Although the De distribution patterns are similar
to those presented in Jacobs et al. (2008c), the interpretation of the
distributions can be simpliﬁed. A reassuring feature of the two
studies is that the CAM De values for the original De data sets of all
samples (Jacobs et al., 2008c) are consistent with the CAM De estimates for the new combined De data sets in this study (Fig. S1),
yielding an average ratio of 1.00 with a standard deviation of 0.03.
This internal consistency conﬁrms that our De measurements are
highly reproducible over time.
The additional data collected in this study indicate that all
samples, except for four samples (DRS4e7) from the LHP in the
“Trench” sector (Figs. 2 and 3), each have De values compatible with
a common De. This suggests that the grains that comprise these
distributions were ‘well-bleached’ prior to burial. The OD values for
these De distributions range between 22.0 ± 1.1% (DRS10) and
26.6 ± 1.2% (DRS9), which are consistent with, or higher than, the
range of OD values obtained from the dose recovery tests (10 ± 1 to
22 ± 3%). We interpret this greater extent of OD to reﬂect natural
variability in the behaviour of grains that is not captured in a
laboratory-controlled experiment, such as a dose recovery test,
and/or the effects of variable beta dose rates delivered to individual
grains (e.g., Galbraith et al., 2005; Galbraith and Roberts, 2012). It is
clear from the micromorphology work conducted at Diepkloof by
Miller et al. (2013) that the beta dose rate to each grain is unlikely to
be homogeneous, owing to the variable composition of materials in
the beta-particle sphere of inﬂuence (2e3 mm radius) around individual quartz grains. Accordingly, for these 9 ‘well-bleached’
samples, we used the CAM to combine the individual De values, and

obtain a ﬁnal weighted mean De for OSL age determination. This
statistical treatment of the data sets is the same as that used by
Tribolo et al. (2013), so differences in age cannot be attributed to the
use or implementation of different age models.
The remaining four samples (DRS4e7) clearly have a small
proportion of grains with signiﬁcantly smaller De values. The
weighted mean De values of these secondary components are
indicated by the solid lines in Fig. S1 and constitute between 1.4 and
2.9% of the grains in each of the respective De distributions. We
interpret these grains to be intrusive from the LSA pits and/or layers
directly overlying the MSA in this part of the site (Parkington et al.,
2013). Such intrusive grains have been incorporated into the sample after burial, so they are not meaningful for dating the target
archaeological event. Removal of these grains reduces the OD
values to 16.2 ± 1.1% (DRS4), 25.9 ± 1.3% (DRS5) and 21.8 ± 1.3%
(DRS7), which are consistent with the range of OD values obtained
for the ‘well-bleached’ samples. The weighted mean De for the
remaining grains, which comprise the major De component, was
obtained directly from the FMM and is taken to represent the
depositional event for these samples.
Only sample DRS6 has a higher OD value (29.2 ± 1.3%) after
removing these intrusive grains, owing to the presence of an
additional, intermediate De component identiﬁed using the FMM.
We do not know whether these latter grains have intruded from a
younger layer of Pleistocene age (‘mixed’), or whether their De
values are the result of a reduced beta dose rate delivered to these
particular grains (‘scattered’), or a combination of these. Given
these uncertainties, we have provided the De values and ages for
both scenarios in Table 1, so that the effect on the calculated age can
be seen.
4.6. Summary of De evaluations
We have demonstrated that our De values are robust to a range
of alternative experimental procedures, and that the preheat
combination used by Jacobs et al. (2008c) did not adversely inﬂuence the outcomes. We have, therefore, falsiﬁed the suggestion of
Tribolo et al. (2013) that the ages of our samples from the IHP, EHP
and SB in the ‘Main’ sector differ from theirs due to underestimation of the single grain De values. We do, however, concur with
Tribolo et al. (2013) that single grain dose recovery tests should be
conducted on the same samples for which single grains are then

184

measured for age determination. This has been standard practice in
our laboratory for a number of years, but was not so in 2006/2007
when the original measurements were made. The consistency of
the ‘old’ and ‘new’ De data sets, separated by several years, are very
pleasing and suggest that 1) our equipment is stable over time, and
2) continuous improvements in our measurement and analytical
procedures over the last 8 years have not introduced any signiﬁcant
systematic biases.
5. Evaluating the beta-particle dose rates at Diepkloof
The sedimentary deposits at Diepkloof are heterogeneous in
their composition and in the spatial distribution of the organic and
inorganic constituents (Miller et al., 2013). Such inhomogeneity is
common at archaeological sites. As a result, quartz grains deposited
at the same time but situated a few mm or cm apart can experience
different beta dose rates, depending on their relative proximity to
materials of high or low radioactivity. The differences in beta dose
rate to individual grains is difﬁcult to model in a way that is both
simple to implement and faithful to the ﬁeld context of the sample,
because each sample poses a unique set of circumstances that no
single model can address without knowing the detailed boundary
conditions speciﬁc to that sample. The beta dose rate is typically
determined on a bulk sample (several grams or tens of grams in
mass) to obtain a ‘sample-average’ beta dose rate, so the collection
of a truly representative sub-sample is imperative. But, even so, the
sample-average beta dose rate is unlikely to be representative of
the beta dose rate to each and every dated grain in a sample. At
Diepkloof, we took a random sub-sample from the sediment
collected for OSL measurement. For these samples, the sampleaverage beta dose rate accounts for between ~50% and 70% of the
total environmental dose rate, so any error associated with the beta
dose rate will have a large effect on the calculated OSL age. In the
next few sections, we provide further details and updates on our
estimates of the beta dose rate for the OSL samples collected at
Diepkloof.
5.1. Updated dose rate conversion factors
rin
Nuclear data tables are updated periodically, from which Gue
et al. (2011, 2012) derived a set of revised dose rate conversion
factors. This necessitates updating the beta dose rate associated
with the laboratory reference standard that we use to calculate the
beta dose rates for our samples using a Risø GM-25-5 beta counter.
The previous update was published by Adamiec and Aitken (1998),
and their conversion factors were used by Jacobs et al. (2008c). We
routinely use a loess sample (Nussi) for which the beta dose rate
has been independently estimated from high-resolution gamma
spectrometry measurements (Kalchgruber, 2002). To convert the
measured values of U, Th and K to beta dose rate, we employed the
rin et al. (2011), resulting in an increase of ~1.5%
new values of Gue
in the Nussi-derived beta dose rate for a dry sample. The outcome
of this is that all of our original dry-sample beta dose rates have
increased by ~1.5% and the ages have decreased by a similar
amount, but such changes are smaller than the margin of error
associated with each age. All the beta dose rates presented in this
paper are based on the updated conversion factors. As Tribolo et al.
rin et al. (2011), the
(2013) also used the conversion factors of Gue
two studies are directly comparable.
5.2. Sizing up the beta dose rate errors
rin et al. (2013) viewed the dose-rate uncertainties cited by
Gue
Jacobs et al. (2008c) for the Diepkloof samples as too small; they
were obtained from GM-25-5 beta-counting. Their objection is

based largely on the results of a study by Ankjærgaard and Murray
(2007), who reported an overdispersion of ~10% among beta dose
rates measured using beta-counting and inferred from highresolution gamma-ray spectrometry measurements of selected
rin et al.
radionuclides in the 238U and 232Th day chains and 40K. Gue
(2013) arbitrarily assigned half of this overdispersion to each of
these two techniques, amounting to ~7% for beta counting and ~7%
for gamma spectrometry (the two values being added together as
the square root of the sum of the squares). Certainly, such an error
may be valid for the speciﬁc instruments used by Ankjærgaard and
Murray (2007) and for samples prepared and measured in the exact
same way. But there is no logical reason to assume that the same
error should apply to any other set of beta counters or to samples
that are prepared differently and measured using background
blanks and reference standards that are also different.
Since our publication of OSL ages for the Diepkloof (and other)
samples in 2008, we have reﬁned and changed the way we calculate our beta dose rate errors on several occasions. So, instead of
defending the errors used in Jacobs et al. (2008c) that we also now
consider too small, we explain here how we currently calculate our
errors and update the beta dose rate estimates accordingly, so the
effect on the ﬁnal ages can be assessed in the context of the total
environmental dose rate. Rex Galbraith has assisted us in devising a
robust method based on an analysis of variance between replicate
measurements. The full procedure, together with a worked
example for one of the samples from Diepkloof, is described in
Supporting Information. This procedure takes into account the
counting errors associated with day-to-day ﬂuctuations in the
behaviour of the equipment, the differences in counting efﬁciencies
of the ﬁve detectors, the reproducibility among the three subsamples measured for each sample, and the counting statistics of
the replicate sub-samples, the laboratory standard and the background blank. Our error estimate also includes four systematic errors, namely the measurement imprecision associated with the
laboratory standard (~1.8%); the uncertainties associated with the
rin et al. (2011), assumed to be
dose rate conversion factors of Gue
~2%; a further ~2% error associated with the correction required for
grain-size attenuation of beta particles (Murray and Olley, 2002);
and the relative error of 40% associated with the water content
estimate of 5 ± 2% for the Diepkloof samples. Using the approach
and equations given in Supporting Information, we calculated total
errors (random plus systematic; see Galbraith and Roberts, 2012)
on the beta dose rate of between 4.6 and 6.1% for the 13 samples
from Diepkloof; the random errors alone range between 2.6 and
4.7%. We note in passing that the latter values are consistent with
the size of the random errors on the beta dose rates reported by
Tribolo et al. (2013) for their sediment samples (2.4e4.1%). These
errors, while larger than those reported by Jacobs et al. (2008c), are
smaller than the random (measurement) error of 7% advocated by
rin et al. (2013) on the basis of the study of Ankjærgaard and
Gue
Murray (2007), in which measurements were made under
different experimental conditions and replicate measurements
were not made for each sample.
5.3. How accurate is the beta dose rate measured using our GM-255 beta counter?
The accuracy of our instrument and procedures has been tested
and conﬁrmed in several ways. We have measured samples as both
loose powder and as powder pressed into pellets and bound
together with a few drops of PVA, with and without delay times
between preparation and measurement (to allow for equilibration
of radon and its daughter products, and to identify any effects of
possible radon loss). Finely powdered sediment was compressed
into pellets using a hydraulic press of a design typical of that used to

Z. Jacobs, R.G. Roberts / Journal of Archaeological Science 63 (2015) 175e192

make pellets for X-ray ﬂuorescence (XRF) analysis, but with a pellet
diameter and depth tailored to our Risø GM-25-5 beta counter.
Fig. 8a shows the beta dose rates calculated for loose sediment (no
delay time) and for pressed pellets (with a 1-month delay time)
measured using the GM-25-5 beta counter, for all 13 samples from
Diepkloof; each data point represents the results of three separate
measurements. The random errors for both data sets were determined using the procedure outlined in Supporting Information, but
the systematic errors are not included for comparison because they
are the same for both data sets. The beta dose rates obtained for the
loose sediment are, on average, ~2.4% higher than the corresponding results for the pressed pellets (ratio of 1.024 ± 0.017), but
Fig. 8a shows that the results are randomly spread around a ratio of
unity and are not systematically biased.
The same data are shown in Fig. 8e as the difference between
each pair of estimates plotted against the mean dose rate of the pair
(after Oldham, 1962). As the size of the standard errors increases in
proportion to the dose rates, we have used the natural logarithms of
the dose rates, following Galbraith and Roberts (2012). The error
bars are shown at 2s, calculated as the square root of the sum of the
variances for each pair of observations. Fig. 8e indicates that the
ratios are only slightly overdispersed (i.e., the empirical scatter is
only slightly larger than expected from the theoretical variances),
as reﬂected in the OD value of 4.0 ± 1.7%.
We have also measured the U, Th and K contents of all 13
samples using 1) a combination of thick-source alpha-counting
(TSAC) for U and Th and XRF for K; and 2) a combination of ICP-MS
(for U and Th) and ICP-OES (for K). We obtain consistent results. The
XRF, ICP-MS and ICP-OES measurements were made independently
in commercial laboratories. Fig. 8b and c compare the beta dose
rates determined from pressed pellets (with a 1-month delay time)
and the GM-25-5 beta counter with those obtained from elemental
concentrations of U, Th and K by ICP-MS/ICP-OES and TSAC/XRF,
respectively. Average ratios consistent with unity were obtained for
both sets of data, again with individual ratios randomly spread
around the 1:1 line. Fig. 8d shows the beta dose rates derived from
ICP-MS/ICP-OES plotted against those calculated from TSAC/XRF
measurements; the results are consistent, with a mean ratio of
0.999 ± 0.017. Fig. 8feh are the corresponding plots of the differences between each pair of log dose rates estimated by these
methods. In each comparison, the ratios are very slightly overdispersed with respect to the expected variances, but the OD values
of 2e3% are not signiﬁcantly different from zero at 2s.
The data in Fig. 8a provide a direct test of our sample preparation and measurement procedures using the GM-25-5 beta
counter, while the comparisons with the independent measurements (Fig. 8b and c) validate the accuracy of our GM-25-5
measurements over a 3-fold range in beta dose rate
(~0.5e~1.5 Gy/ka). These comparisons clearly indicate that our
new errors are not too small and that the concerns raised by
rin et al. (2013) about the accuracy of our beta dose rate
Gue
measurements are unfounded. We consider that the beta dose
rates derived using the pressed pellets, with a 1-month delay time
before measurement, are the most reliable estimates, because
pressed pellets provide reproducible sample geometry and retain
radon gas. Accordingly, we have incorporated these values in the
total environmental dose rates used to calculate the ages of the
Diepkloof samples.
5.4. Comparing our beta dose rates with those of Tribolo et al.
(2013)
Owing to the differences in sampling locations at Diepkloof, only
a few samples are comparable between the two studies. For lithological unit 2 (LU2; Miller et al., 2013) sample DRS13 (SUs Kate and

185

Kenny) can be compared to DRS-OSL5 (SU Kenny) and DRS-OSL6
(SU Jess), and sample DRS17 (SU Noel) can be compared to DRSOSL1 (SU Noel). For LU1, sample DRS15 (SU Mark) can be
compared to DRS-OSL3 (SU Mike). DRS11 (SUs John and Jeff) is not
directly comparable to DRS-OSL8 (SU Fox) as these samples originate from LU3 and LU4, respectively (Miller et al., 2013), but they
are located close to each other. Fig. 9aed shows the various estimates of U, Th and K concentrations. The closed symbols denote the
samples measured in this study using ICP-MS and ICP-OES (circles),
XRF (diamonds), and TSAC and GM-25-5 beta counting (squares).
The open triangles are the beta dose rates reported in Tribolo et al.
(2013), deduced from high resolution gamma spectrometry (HRGS)
measurements. Regardless of the measurement technique used,
consistent results are obtained for the measurement of U for 3 of
the 4 comparisons, and the discrepancy in Fig. 9c is small. Measurements of Th are more variable: ICP-MS and HRGS data are
consistent in all four cases, whereas the TSAC measurements are
sometimes signiﬁcantly different and have much larger
uncertainties.
The most important estimate is that of potassium (K) because
this accounts for most of the beta dose rate (see below). Samples
DRS11 (IHP) and DRS13 (EHP) were collected from the technological units in the ‘Main’ sector that had widely divergent results
(Fig. 1). It is clear that there are signiﬁcant differences in the estimates of K obtained in this study compared to those reported by
Tribolo et al. (2013) for two of the critical comparisons (Fig. 10a and
b). For our samples, we obtained estimates of K using two measurement techniques (ICP-OES and XRF) that directly measure the K
concentration, and a combination of two techniques (TSAC and
GM-25-5 beta counting) that enable an indirect estimate of K to be
made by subtraction. These measurements were made on separate
sub-samples of sediment from the sample collected for OSL dating
with 5 g of material used for the ICP and XRF measurements (from
which a further small sub-sample was randomly picked for measurement) and ~2.5 g for TSAC and ~6 g for the triplicate GM-25-5
measurements. Since the beta dose rate is derived from material
distributed 2e3 mm around the grains, it is important to measure K
on a sample of sediment associated as closely as possible with the
dated grains. The ICP-OES and XRF measurements were made by
external commercial laboratories using their own reference standards, so these data provide a completely independent measure of
the accuracy of our in-house measurements. We note that no information is provided by Tribolo et al. (2013) about the size of the
samples analysed by HRGS or how these sediment relate physically
to the OSL samples.
Why do we need to obtain reliable estimates of the K content?
The average contributions of U and Th to the beta dose rates of the
Diepkloof samples are only ~10% and ~6%, respectively, so any
disequilibria in the U chain or differences in the measured concentrations of Th (Fig. 9) will have a negligible effect on the
calculated beta dose rates. By contrast, the radioactive decay of 40K
contributes ~84% of the average beta dose rate, so even a small
difference can signiﬁcantly affect the calculated age. For the deposits associated with the EHP and IHP (Fig. 9a and b), the HRGS
estimates of K presented by Tribolo et al. (2013) are 44e48% lower
than those obtained in this study using three independent
methods. The repercussions of this on the beta dose rate are
evident in Fig. 9aed: the open circles are the beta dose rates obtained using GM-25-5 beta counting of pressed pellets measured
after a 1-month delay and in triplicate; these are the beta dose rates
used to calculate the ﬁnal ages. The ﬁlled circles and the open
diamond symbols are the corresponding dose rates calculated using ICP-MS and ICP-OES, and TSAC and XRF, respectively. These
three independent estimates are in good agreement. In contrast,
the open triangles are the calculated beta dose rates obtained by

elemental concentrations of U, Th and K derived from ICP-MS and ICP-OES measurements. c) Comparison of GM-25-5 beta dose rates with those estimated from a combination of

Z. Jacobs, R.G. Roberts / Journal of Archaeological Science 63 (2015) 175e192

Tribolo et al. (2013), which are ~35e38% smaller; the latter will give
rise to ages that are older by the same percentage.
On the other hand, for the deposits associated with the Lower
MSA (Fig. 9c and d), the estimates of K obtained by Tribolo et al.
(2013) are compatible with those obtained in this study, and the
beta dose rates are also statistically consistent. As the ages for the
Lower MSA are likewise statistically concordant between the two
studies, we deduce that the methods employed by Jacobs et al.
(2008c) and Tribolo et al. (2013) are not the cause of the chronological discrepancy between the IHP, EHP and SB at Diepkloof.
Instead, we conclude that the samples collected and measured by
us and by Tribolo et al. (2013) genuinely have different concentrations of K. While we have ﬁrst-hand knowledge of how our
samples for beta dose rate determination relate to the dated grains,
we cannot say the same for those collected by Tribolo et al. (2013).
Miller et al. (2013) have shown that the Diepkloof deposits have a
complex composition and spatial distribution of materials at the
scale of a few millimetres (i.e., the range of beta particles), so it is
paramount to ensure that the samples used for 40K determination
are intimately related and representative of the sediments for
which De values are obtained. We consider the difference in the
estimation of the K content as the most likely reason for the
discrepant OSL ages at Diepkloof. Further work could usefully focus
on the construction of a detailed and spatial map of K across the site
to resolve deﬁnitively which (if either) of the two OSL chronologies
for the IHP, EHP and SB at Diepkloof is correct.

187

conversion factors (Adamiec and Aitken, 1998) in use at that time.
Also shown in Fig. 10, as ﬁlled circles, are the corresponding ages
obtained using the CAM De values and the bulk (unadjusted) beta
dose rates. The CAM ages include all De valuesdthat is, none of the
grains in each of the distributions interpreted as intrusive have
been removed. From this plot, it can be seen that the beta dose
adjustment method has only a small effect. None of the CAM ages
differ by more than 1s from their FMM counterparts, even when
using the errors on the beta dose rate that we now consider too
small and if intrusive (younger) grains are included in the CAM De
estimates of samples DRS4e7. The CAM ages (calculated using the
unadjusted beta dose rate) are, in general, slightly younger than the
beta-adjusted FMM ages (albeit within 1s uncertainty), which is
opposite to the effect proposed by Tribolo et al. (2013). That is to
say, the use of CAM ages does not remove, or even reduce, the
extent of the discrepancy with the ages reported by Tribolo et al.
(2013) for the IHP to pre-SB layers at Diepkloof.
Here we have demonstrated that the beta dose rate adjustment
method has a negligible effect on the estimation of OSL age at
Diepkloof Rockshelter. Accordingly, we have taken the most
parsimonious approach and have not used this method to calculate
rin et al.’s criticism
the OSL ages in this study. Other aspects of Gue
of the adjustment method will be discussed elsewhere (see also
Galbraith, 2015), as they now have no bearing on the calculated
ages for the samples from Diepkloof.

5.6. Summary of beta dose rate evaluations
5.5. The beta dose rate adjustment method of Jacobs et al. (2008b)
The beta dose rate adjustment method of Jacobs et al. (2008b)
was applied to 8 of the 13 Diepkloof samples presented in Jacobs
et al. (2008c)dthat is, all of the samples interpreted as having
‘scattered’ and ‘scattered and mixed’ De distributions. This
rin
approach has been criticised by Tribolo et al. (2013) and Gue
et al. (2013). Tribolo et al. (2013) attempted to reconstruct from
our published data what the ages would have been had we not used
the beta dose rate adjustment method, but their task was made
difﬁcult because we did not report the weighted mean De values or
the unadjusted (bulk) beta dose rates in Jacobs et al. (2008c). Based
on their calculations, Tribolo et al. (2013) suggested that the
recalculated ages were within 10% of those originally reported and
that one sample from the LHP had a recalculated age that was 16%
older. They also pointed out that application of the beta dose rate
adjustment cannot resolve all of the age discrepancies between the
two studies.
The original ages presented in Jacobs et al. (2008c, Table S8) are
shown here in Fig. 10 as open squares (for ‘scattered’ and ‘scattered
and mixed’ samples, to which the FMM and the beta dose adjustment method was applied) and as open triangles for the two
‘mixed’ samples (DRS4 and DRS10) to which the FMM was applied
with the bulk (unadjusted) beta dose rate. DRS10 was claimed by
rin et al. (2013) to represent an example of the inconsistent
Gue
application of the beta dose rate adjustment method, but, in fact, no
such adjustment was made for this sample, so their claim is unfounded. Note that these ages do not incorporate the updated dose
rate conversion factors or our error calculations, but represent the
original data presented in Jacobs et al. (2008c) and the dose rate

We have demonstrated that our beta dose rates are both accurate and reproducible using a range of independent measurement
techniques, with measurements performed in-house and by
external laboratories. We have updated our previously published
beta dose rates using the latest conversion factors and reassessed
the errors associated with our beta dose rates. A worked example of
the latter is provided in Supporting Information. We compared our
beta dose rates, and the estimates of U, Th and K, to those of the
samples in Tribolo et al. (2013) that are most closely comparable,
and found that the discrepant ages (notably those for the IHP and
EHP) are associated with signiﬁcantly different estimates of K,
which accounts for ~84% of the beta dose rate. The reason for the
discrepancy in 40K estimation is not fully understood and needs
further investigation. We obtained reproducible estimates of K for
our samples using 3 different methods, which gives us conﬁdence
in our measurement of K for the samples that we collected and
measured. We consider the sub-samples used for determination of
K for our samples are appropriate, as they were collected from
within the OSL sediment sample and are, therefore, representative
of the latter. Furthermore, the 3 methods require different amounts
of material, so the reproducibility of the results argues against
inappropriate sub-sampling. Few details are available regarding the
HRGS sample collection and measurement procedures used by
Tribolo et al. (2013), and spatial differences in beta dose rates in
different parts of the rockshelter deposit need to be investigated
further. Finally, we have shown that the beta dose adjustment
method of Jacobs et al. (2008b) does not result in ages signiﬁcantly
different or younger than those obtained without this adjustment.
In this study, we have simpliﬁed our interpretation of the De

TSAC and XRF measurements. d) Comparison of beta dose rates obtained from ICP-MS and ICP-OES with those estimated from TSAC and XRF. The broken line indicates the 1:1 ratio.
Also listed are the mean ratio and standard error for each pair of data sets, and the associated overdispersion among the individual ratios, calculated using the CAM. Panels e), f), g)
and h) are the corresponding plots of the difference between each pair of log dose rates (on the vertical axis) against the mean log dose rate of the pair (on the horizontal axis). The
error bars are at 2s and were calculated from the theoretical standard errors for each pair of observations. The natural logs of the dose rates are used for this comparison because
variation can be more easily interpreted on a log scale when, as here, the size of the error increases with the size of the dose rate by the same multiplicative factor (Galbraith and
Roberts, 2012).

distributions, and in doing so, have not used the beta-adjustment
method. After re-measuring of the beta dose rates, updating the
error calculations and conversion factors, the new ages calculated
in this study differ only marginally from the original ages reported
by Jacobs et al. (2008c).

6. A revised single grain OSL chronology for the Diepkloof
deposits
The ﬁnal ages for all 13 samples are listed in Table 1, together
with the supporting De and dose rate estimates, and displayed as
open circles in Fig. 11. Uncertainties on the ages are given at 1s
(standard error of the mean) and were derived by combining, in
quadrature, all known and estimated sources of random and systematic error. For the sample De, the random error was obtained
from the particular statistical model used to determine the
weighted mean (i.e., CAM or FMM), and a systematic error (of 2%)
was included for any possible bias associated with calibration of the
laboratory beta source. The error on the CAM De estimate incorporates any observed overdispersion among the individual De
values, while the error on the FMM De estimate includes the
overdispersion required to get the statistically optimised ﬁt.
Ages of 43.6 ± 1.9 ka (DRS9) and 51.9 ± 2.3 ka (DRS8) were obtained for the post-HP sediments. Sediments from the underlying
late-HP (LHP) layers in the ‘Trench’ sector gave ages, in stratigraphic
order, of 49.1 ± 2.2 (CAM) or 59.2 ± 2.7 (FMM) for DRS6, 56.0 ± 2.5
(DRS5), 61.6 ± 2.7 (DRS4) and 57.5 ± 2.5 ka (DRS7); an age of
65.9 ± 3.0 ka (DRS10) was obtained for the top of the ‘Main’ sector.
The IHP and EHP are here dated to 60.8 ± 2.6 ka (DRS11) and
65.1 ± 2.8 ka (DRS13), respectively, and the underlying SB to
76.5 ± 3.3 ka (DRS14). Three ages of 88.4 ± 4.0 (DRS15), 93.3 ± 4.4
(DRS16) and 88.2 ± 4.4 ka (DRS17) were obtained for the Lower
MSA layers.
How do these new ages compare to those presented in Jacobs
et al. (2008c)? The two sets are presented in Fig. 11, which shows
that the ages have not changed signiﬁcantly, despite updates on the
conversion factors, new measurements of the beta dose rate and
additional De measurements on single grains. It is also clear that the

189

new ages are both younger and older than the old agesdthat is,
they are not systematically higher or lowerdyielding an average
ratio of ‘new’ compared to ‘old’ ages of 0.99 ± 0.02dthus, an
average difference of only ~1%. Most of the ‘old’ and ‘new’ ages are
consistent at 1s, but there are 2 samples that show greater deviation. The most conspicuous is DRS6, for which we obtained a De
distribution that could be interpreted in two different ways (see
Fig. S1). In Table 1, we reported both the CAM De value (assuming a
single dose-population) and, assuming additional mixing, the FMM
De value for the high-dose population, which comprises ~66% of the
total number of dated grains. The CAM De value yields an age
consistent with those for the overlying post-HP, whereas the FMM
De value gives an age consistent with those for the LHP.
DRS13 is also worth elaborating on, as this sample was previously assigned to the SB, and has been re-assigned to the EHP, by
Porraz et al. (2013). DRS13 is also the sample for which we obtained
statistically smaller De values than our original De value using
alternative preheat combinations (see Fig. 6b). By contrast, slightly
larger measured doses were obtained using two alternative preheat
combinations in the dose recovery test (Fig. 5b), so the effect of the
preheat on this sample is ambiguous. The original preheat combination was used to measure the ‘new’ De values, so the difference
between the latter and the ‘old’ De values is not due to the preheat.
The age of 65 ± 3 ka plotted in Fig. 11 is based on the weighted
mean of the ‘old’ and ‘new’ De values. If we use only the ‘old’ De
value of 116 ± 2 Gy, then we obtain an age of 69.8 ± 3.0 ka, which is
consistent with the ‘old’ age of 70.9 ± 2.3 ka (FMM þ adjusted beta
dose rate) or 68.6 ± 4.0 ka (CAM þ bulk beta dose rate). If we use
only the ‘new’ De value of 104 ± 2 Gy, then an age of 62.6 ± 2.7 ka is
calculated. We have no objective basis to prefer one data set over
the other, and the two sets of De values cannot be resolved
graphically, so at this stage we have opted to combine the ‘old’ and
the ‘new’ De values (plotted on Fig. 6e) to calculate the depositional
age of DRS13. We accept that the differences in De values might
reﬂect mixing across the boundary between the EHP and SB, but we
cannot resolve this issue at present. We note that using the preheat
combination suggested by Tribolo et al. (2013) as the most appropriate for their sample from the EHP, give rise to younger ages,
rather than the much older ages required to match theirs. This
outcome further supports our argument that the age discrepancies
between Jacobs et al. (2008c) and Tribolo et al. (2013) are not due to
our speciﬁc measurement and data analysis procedures, but is the
result of real differences between the samplesdin particular spatial
variations in the potassium content in the pre-SB to IHP deposits.
7. Discussion
7.1. Age comparisons and stratigraphic correlations

Fig. 11. Summary of single grain OSL ages with 1s errors for sediment samples
collected from Diepkloof Rockshelter. Open circles are ages published by Jacobs et al.
(2008c) and ﬁlled circles are the ages calculated in this study. Note that two alternative revised ages (based on the CAM and FMM) are provided for DRS6. The DRS
numbers at the left are the sample codes, and the technological phases at the right are
as assigned by Porraz et al. (2013a).

How do our revised ages for Diepkloof compare to the ages of
Tribolo et al. (2013)? Their single TL age of 68 ± 7 ka for the post-HP
is inconsistent with our OSL ages of 44 ± 2 and 52 ± 2 ka, and is also
older than their TL ages from the underlying layers OB2e4 in the
‘Back’ sector, which represents the LHP: the latter TL ages give a
weighted mean of 52 ± 5 ka. Porraz et al. (2013b: p. 3396), incorrectly attribute this TL age to the post-HP instead of the LHP. Our
OSL ages for the LHP in the ‘Trench’ sector are consistent with their
TL, but discrepancies remain for the IHP, EHP and SB chronologies.
In this study, we obtained a single OSL age for the IHP: 61 ± 3 ka for
sample DRS11, from near the base of this technological phase. This
age is consistent with the TL ages (weighted mean of 65 ± 8 ka)
obtained by Tribolo et al. (2013) for samples from layer OB5 in the
‘Back’ sector. The OSL age for DRS11 is also consistent (at 2s) with
the weighted mean TL/ITL age (77 ± 8 ka) for the same SU (John) in
the ‘Main’ sector, but is signiﬁcantly younger than the weighted

190

Z. Jacobs, R.G. Roberts / Journal of Archaeological Science 63 (2015) 175e192

mean ITL and OSL ages for samples from the overlying SUs Fred
(83 ± 8 ka) and Fox (85 ± 9 ka).
We note, however, that there is confusion over the exact stratigraphic relationship between layer OB5 in the ‘Back’ sector and the
layers representing the IHP in the ‘Main’ sector, which has implications for how the chronological framework for the site is constructed and interpreted. Tribolo et al. (2009) stated that
“Stratigraphic relationships suggest OB5 and John might be contemporaneous”, but Tribolo et al. (2013) present the ages in Table 3 as if
the OB5 samples lie stratigraphically above those from SUs Fred,
Fox and John. The ages are presented in chronological order, and
not necessarily in stratigraphic order. Nowhere in the 2013
compilation of papers is it suggested that the stratigraphic relationship proposed by Tribolo et al. (2009) is invalid. Parkington
et al. (2013), however, clearly states that direct stratigraphic connections between the different sectors only exists for the upper
MSA deposits (but did not deﬁne what this means), and that they
“favour the study of each sector as an independent unit” while investigations are ongoing into the correlations between the different
and discontinuous excavated areas (Parkington et al., 2013, p. 3371).
Yet, the chronology proposed for Diepkloof by Tribolo et al. (2013)
and Porraz et al. (2013b) does not adhere to this preference. It is
imperative, therefore, to understand where OB5 ﬁts into the
stratigraphic framework before an age model can be reliably
developed for the site and inferences drawn about durations of
technological complexes, as was attempted by Porraz et al. (2013b:
Fig. 3). The presentation of ages for the IHP in Tribolo et al. (2013)
and Porraz et al. (2013b) implies continuous occupation and a
signiﬁcant duration for the IHP, starting at ~90 ka ago (when MSA
Jack appears in the sequence), and ending ~60 ka ago (Tribolo et al.,
2013). We consider it premature to rely on this chronology in the
absence of supporting evidence for the stratigraphic association of
the ‘Back’ and ‘Main’ sectors.
A ~40 ka discrepancy exists between our OSL ages and their OSL
and TL ages for the EHP, and a similarly large difference (~35 ka)
remains between the two sets of ages for the SB. But, the TL and OSL
ages of Tribolo et al. (2013) are consistent with our OSL ages for the
Lower MSA in the ‘Main’ sector.
7.2. The size of age uncertainties and what they mean
It is worthwhile making a comment about the small size of the
uncertainties associated with our ages, relative to those associated
with the ages presented in Tribolo et al. (2013) (see Fig. 1 for a
graphical display). Tribolo et al. (2013, p. 3409) commented that the
ages reported by Jacobs et al. (2008c) have “an unusual precision”.
Our original ages had relative standard errors of ~3.5%, and part of
this precision is due to the small errors associated with the beta
dose rate. As discussed above, we have now updated these errors
using the method outlined in Supporting Information. We also
noted earlier that the measurement (‘random’) errors for the beta
dose rates are consistent with those reported by Tribolo et al. (2013)
for their samples, and which were measured in a different way. The
random errors on the gamma dose rates are about the same size in
this study and Tribolo et al. (2013), and the two studies use the
same relative error (40%) on the water content (5 ± 2%). There is
good agreement between the gamma dose rate estimates where
comparisons can be made, as was discussed in Tribolo et al. (2009).
The random error associated with the total environmental dose rate
ranges between 1.4 (DRS-OSL4) and 3.7% (DRS-OSL8) for the Tribolo
et al. (2013) samples and between 1.7 and 3.0% for the ages presented in this study. Note that the latter does not include the error
associated with our estimate of the water contentdit is treated as a
‘systematic’ error because it is the same for all samples and, hence,
will bias the ages in the same direction.

In practical terms, random errors of measurement can be
reduced by making multiple repeated, independent measurements
under the same conditions, and then averaging these estimates
appropriately. So, for example, the random error on the estimate of
the beta dose rate can be reduced in size by making more replicate
measurements. Similarly, by making more single grain measurements for a particular sample, the size of the standard error of the
mean De can be reduced, because the latter is calculated as the
population standard deviation divided by the square root of the
number of measured grains. By contrast, systematic errors cannot
be reduced by averaging: they remain of ﬁxed size, no matter how
many measurements are made. For example, in this study we have
rin et al.
used the updated dose rate conversion factors of Gue
(2011). But if the true conversion factors (which are not known)
are slightly different from these latest estimates, then all of our ages
will either be slightly too old or too young (hence the ‘systematic’
epithet). So we have included a 2% systematic error in the total age
uncertainty to allow for any possible bias associated with these
conversion factors, as well as various other systematic errors as
mentioned above. When comparing and combining ages obtained
using identical measurement and data analysis procedures, the
systematic errors should be omitted because they are common to
all of the samples. But they should be included when comparing
our OSL ages with those reported by independent studies, such as
Tribolo et al. (2013), and with ages obtained using other dating
methods. Other statistical aspects of random and systematic errors
are discussed by Galbraith and Roberts (2012).
The biggest difference between the data presented in this study
and in Tribolo et al. (2013) is the standard error on the weighted
mean De values. The random errors on the De values for the single
grain OSL samples of Tribolo et al. (2013) range between 2.7 (DRSOSL7) and 4.2% (DRS-OSL1), compared to the error range of 1.0
(DRS14) and 2.2% (DRS17) for the ages in this study. The reason is
that we have measured between 3 and 12 times more single grains
for our samples than did Tribolo et al. (2013), so by increasing the
number of observations, we have reduced considerably the size of
our random errors. For example, we calculated the weighted mean
De using between 255 grains (DRS17) and 1040 grains (DRS14),
whereas Tribolo et al. (2013) used between 85 (DRS-OSL1) and 185
(DRS-OSL7) grains to calculate the weighted mean De values of
their samples. They have also observed slightly larger overdispersion among their single grain De estimates (29 ± 2 to 37 ± 3%)
than we did (21 ± 1 to 34 ± 1%, with most samples below 25%),
which also contributes to the size of the calculated random error.
Importantly, both studies used the same age modeldthe CAM of
Galbraith et al. (1999)dso, we have calculated the errors on the
weighted mean De in an identical manner; where the FMM was
used in this study, the calculated random error also takes the
overdispersion among De values into account. The random errors
associated with individual burnt stone samples are apt to be much
larger because many fewer TL measurements are made; Tribolo
et al. (2013) report random errors on the De values for individual
samples of between 2.2% (DRS1) and 11.5% (DRS132).
The other signiﬁcant difference in the total uncertainty associated with the ages appears to relate to the addition of systematic
errors that are not deﬁned by Tribolo et al. (2013). They state, in the
caption of their Table 3 that “The uncertainties are statistical but for
the ages where the systematic uncertainties are taken into account.”,
but further details are not provided. We can estimate what the total
systematic error is for each sample, but we cannot reconstruct the
individual components. To be fair to Tribolo et al. (2013), it is not
common practice to report the errors in such detail. Nevertheless,
the total systematic error amounts to between about 6 and 9% of
the total age uncertainties for their samples, compared to ~3.8% for
the OSL samples in this study. Accordingly, when our random and

Z. Jacobs, R.G. Roberts / Journal of Archaeological Science 63 (2015) 175e192

systematic errors on the De and dose rate are combined in quadrature, our OSL ages have total 1s errors of ~4.5%, compared to
5e12% for the samples presented in Tribolo et al. (2013).
So, what are the beneﬁts of determining ages with the smallest
possible errors? By minimising the size of the measurement errors
and by employing a systematic approach e such as that adopted by
Jacobs et al. (2008c) for MSA sites across southern Africa e chronologies can be ﬁne-tuned and allow the timing and duration of
archaeological events to be estimated with improved precision.
Compared to some other numerical dating methods, however, the
age uncertainties attached to OSL and TL dating are large, owing to
the need to measure many quantities, each of which has an associated random or systematic error and which may also be subject to
natural variation. It is critical, therefore, to quantify each of these
sources of error using well-established statistical procedures and
approaches and to report these in publications (Galbraith and
Roberts, 2012). For example, errors need to be correctly estimated
to properly interpret the distribution of single grain De values and
to compare (and perhaps combine) OSL ages for different samples.
If the size of the errors is overestimated, then the De or age distribution may appear to be homogeneous when it is not; and a
single-component De or age distribution may appear to consist of
multiple components if the size of the errors is underestimated. We
concur, therefore, with the edict of Ludwig (2003, p. 632) that “the
uncertainty of a date is no less signiﬁcant than the date itself.”
7.3. Current state of play at Diepkloof
The signiﬁcant discrepancies between the luminescence chronologies of Tribolo et al. (2013) and this study for the IHP, EHP and
SB technological phases remains a conundrum. Here we have
presented ample data to suggest that our single grain OSL chronology is accurate for the deposits dated and cannot be dismissed
out of hand. Notably, we have shown that our measurement and
analytical procedures do not introduce systematic biases, as some
of the ages are consistent with those of Tribolo et al. (2013),
whereas others are not. Moreover, the discrepancy in ages for
certain portions of the Diepkloof deposit cannot be used as a valid
reason to cast doubt on the OSL ages produced by us for other sites.
On the contrary, there is good agreement between our OSL ages and
the TL chronologies published for several other sites in southern
Africa e including Blombos Cave (Tribolo et al., 2006), Klasies River
(Tribolo et al., 2005) and Rose Cottage Cave (Valladas et al., 2005).
We do not suggest that the ages of Tribolo et al. (2013) are necessarily in error, but, rather, that further work is needed to resolve the
discrepancies at Diepkloof. At this stage we do not favour one
chronology over another. This has implications for the age model
advocated for Diepkloof by Porraz et al. (2013b), which is solely
based on the TL/ITL and OSL ages of Tribolo et al. (2013). Diepkloof
Rockshelter is currently the anomaly amongst the many dated HP
and SB sites in southern Africa (e.g., Grün et al., 2001; Valladas et al.,
€ gberg and
2005; Tribolo et al., 2006; Jacobs et al., 2008c, 2013; Ho
Larsson, 2011; Henshilwood et al., 2014; Marean et al., 2014) and
should be treated as such until the dating enigma is satisfactorily
resolved. We note that at least 5 laboratories have contributed the
ages reported in these studies, so there is broad agreement between our ﬁndings and those of independent laboratories for a
range of different sites.

191

present, however, the site is in a dating deadlock. Several recent
papers on Diepkloof Rockshelter, published in a Special Issue of
this journal, dismissed the single grain OSL chronology proposed
for the site by Jacobs et al. (2008c), choosing instead to adopt the
chronology presented by Tribolo et al. (2013). The latter paper,
rin et al. (2013), suggested some
together with another by Gue
possible reasons for why the chronology of Jacobs et al. (2008c)
might be ﬂawed. In this paper, we have addressed those criticisms by testing them explicitly via a series of targeted experiments, new measurements and re-assessments of some of our
procedures, including all of those criticised by Tribolo et al. (2013)
rin et al. (2013). The results are provided in full in this
and Gue
paper, from which we conclude that their concerns are unfounded. The single grain De values of all 13 samples measured by
us exhibit great consistency across a range of alternative experimental conditions, both in laboratory-controlled trials and in
measurements of the natural signal. The beta dose rates estimated
for our samples were also highly reproducible despite measuring
the samples using three independent techniques. These results
support the reliability and accuracy of our in-house measurements of the beta dose rate used in this study and by Jacobs et al.
(2008c). We have explicitly addressed the issue of the size of the
errors associated with our beta dose rate, and discussed the difference in the size of the errors associated with our OSL ages
compared to the TL/ITL and OSL ages presented in Tribolo et al.
(2013) to explain why our age uncertainties remain smaller than
theirs.
Despite the number of updates and new measurements made
in this study, we still obtain results consistent with the ‘old’ OSL
chronology of Jacobs et al. (2008c), but the provision of substantial
additional data has improved the accuracy of the ‘new’ chronology.
Importantly, while we have shown that the OSL chronology for our
samples is robust to a wide range of reasonable alternative assumptions and measurement options, we cannot refute the chronology of Tribolo et al. (2013). One reason for this stalemate is that
the two studies did not date samples from the exact same locations. This means that an age discrepancy continues to exist in
some parts of the site, and that further work, conducted in a systematic manner, on samples collected from different parts of the
site is needed to resolve the issue. Investigations of the spatial
variations in the luminescence properties and radioactivity of the
sediment associated with the Intermediate HP, Early HP and SB
technological phases would be particularly valuable as these layers
of the site suffer from the largest age discrepancies. At present, the
OSL and TL ages proposed by Tribolo et al. (2013) for these technological phases are at odds with the ages proposed in this study
at Diepkloof and by other dating studies of HP and SB sites in
southern Africa.

8. Concluding remarks
The archaeological sequence at Diepkloof Rockshelter is one of
the most important and detailed records of its type in southern
Africa, and an accurate chronological framework is fundamentally
important to the resolution of debates concerning the MSA. At
