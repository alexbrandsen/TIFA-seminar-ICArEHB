Abstract Teotihuacan in the northeastern Basin of Mexico was an unusually large
and influential early city and state. This article reviews recent research trends in
Teotihuacan from its founding and explosive growth ca. 100 BC into the largest city
in Mesoamerica. Biogenetics provide details of how immigration fueled the city’s
growth and shaped its multiethnic composition and link Teotihuacan to other parts
of the central highlands and more distant regions. Urban theory highlights the
importance of neighborhoods and how their composition changed. Collective
aspects of irrigation, markets, warfare and the military, and ideology encouraged the
development of Teotihuacan’s corporate governance. Although Teotihuacan politically dominated central Mexico, its control over the regional economy was not as
centralized. Beyond its hinterland, Teotihuacan’s foreign relations were a mosaic of
trade diasporas, diplomatic exchanges, pilgrimages, emulation, and strategic direct
interventions of limited duration. As its foreign influence retracted, Teotihuacan
faced challenges from its hinterlands and intermediate elites and factions that culminated in the burning and desecration of the urban center. The Epiclassic saw the
change from Teotihuacan’s regional state to city-states and confederations.
Although much reduced in size, Postclassic Teotihuacan retained an enormous
legacy that subsequent states sought for their historical validation.

Introduction
The recent literature on Teotihuacan is expansive and parallels the size and
influence of this great early city. Research on Teotihuacan is important not only for
what we learn about the city but also its state system, its foreign relations, and its
legacy. Teotihuacan is a key site for comparative studies of urbanism and state
formation—one of archaeology’s ‘‘grand challenges’’ (Kintigh et al. 2014; also
Smith 2012). Research on Teotihuacan has shaped and been shaped by significant
theoretical and methodological developments in archaeology.
Citing an extraordinarily influential synthesis by Armillas (1950), Millon (1992)
noted that 1950 was pivotal in Teotihuacan studies. The following decade saw the
inception of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project, the Basin of Mexico settlement
pattern surveys, and Proyecto Teotihuacan of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologı́a
e Historia’s (INAH) (Bernal 1963; Millon 1973; Sanders et al. 1979). These projects
reshaped the way we see Teotihuacan and laid the foundation for current
Teotihuacan studies and wider understandings of urbanism and state formation
(Altschul 1997; López Luján et al. 2005a; Manzanilla 2004b; Matos 2003; Millon
1992; Nichols 1996) (Fig. 1). These projects now serve as a basis for heritage
management, salvage archaeology, economic development, and local planning
(Webmoor 2005).
Recent large-scale projects on Teotihuacan’s major pyramids and apartment
complexes focus on governance, urban organization, and ideology (Cabrera and
Sugiyama 2004, 2009; Gazzola et al. 2010, p. 345; Gómez 2000, 2013; Manzanilla
2007; Sugiyama and Cabrera 2007; Sugiyama and Sarabia 2011). Equally important

are less spectacular investigations and interpretive studies of the city, its hinterlands,
and foreign relations. Interdisciplinary research and wider applications of new
methods, including soil, dental, and bone chemistry, residue analysis, geophysics
and multispectral aerial imagery, and geochemical source studies have revealed new
details about environmental changes, resource use, daily life, social relations,
immigration, and hinterland and interregional interactions. Recent research on
Teotihuacan incorporates diverse theoretical strands, as is characteristic of
Mesoamerican archaeology more generally (Gándara 2012; Nichols and Pool 2012).
Books on Teotihuacan by art historians (Headrick 2007; Pasztory 1997)
complement Cowgill’s (2015) new archaeological synthesis. Recent books on the
Feathered Serpent Pyramid (Sugiyama 2005) and the obsidian workshop at the
Moon Pyramid (Carballo 2011a) share overlapping themes about politics, religion,
and state ideology and its materialization. Linné’s (2003a, b) early volumes on
Teotihuacan have been reissued.
Topical edited volumes address varied aspects of Teotihuacan, including
chronology (Brambila and Cabrera 1998a; Rattray 2001), Maya and Teotihuacan
(Braswell 2003a), Teotihuacan’s Postclassic legacy (Carrasco et al. 2000a), Classic–
Postclassic population changes (Manzanilla 2005c), mortuary practices (González
2009; Manzanilla and Serrano 1999; Rattray 1997; Sempowski and Spence 1994),
politics and ideology (Ruiz 2002), Gulf Coast–Teotihuacan relations (Ruiz and Soto
2004), urbanism and architecture (Manzanilla 2012; Ruiz and Torres 2005), and
Coyotlatelco and the Epiclassic (Solar 2006c). Exhibitions have brought scholarship
to a wider public (Cabrera 2004; INAH 2009; Manzanilla 2004a, b; Sugiyama and
Cabrera Castro 2004). Review articles (e.g., Cowgill 2000b, 2001a, b, 2008a;
Manzanilla and López Luján 2000; Sugiyama 2012) complement Millon’s (e.g.,
1993) earlier important syntheses.
I focus on recent trends in Teotihuacan studies and include work regarding
Teotihuacan during the Epiclassic and the Postclassic. I conclude with comments
about future directions.

Teotihuacan: The City
Neo-evolutionism provided the dominant framework for many archaeologists as the
results of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project, the Basin of Mexico settlement pattern
project, and INAH excavations began to appear in the 1960s and 1970s. Millon
(e.g., 1976) and his colleagues were very critical of that framework. Ensuing
debates on the role of prime movers in the origins of Teotihuacan became especially
intense concerning the relative importance of material factors—hydraulic agriculture, demography, craft specialization, and exchange—versus politics and religion.
The debates abated in the 1990s as theoretical frameworks diversified and
incorporated agency, political economy, gender, identity, historical ecology, and
ideology. The decline in research on environmental relations and economies in the
archaeology of early states noted by Smith (2004) was not as pronounced at
Teotihuacan as in other regions. Some debates have been renewed, particularly
regarding the dominant language spoken at Teotihuacan, the nature of its writing/

notation system, the role of migration and environmental changes in the city’s
collapse, and Teotihuacan’s foreign influence.
Chronology
The city’s chronology remains a point of contention (Table 1). We still know too
little about the early history of Teotihuacan. The Formative period in the Basin of
Mexico in general has been understudied (Plunket and Uruñuela 2012). During the
Late Formative, Cuanalan phase, villages shifted from hillsides to the valley floor;
the largest settlement was located near Teotihuacan’s springs with their rich
agricultural potential (Cowgill et al. 2003, p. 9). Teotihuacan’s urban growth took
off during the subsequent Patlachique phase (100–1 BC). An elite compound inside
the Ciudadela dates to AD 50–150 (Gazzola 2009a, p. 219; Gazzola et al. 2010,
p. 345). The Moon Pyramid began with a small platform in the Patlachique phase,
oriented 11–12 east of north (Cowgill personal communication, 2012). The

platform predates the present urban grid orientation and is one of the earliest dated
public structures in the city (Cabrera 2006; Cowgill 2008a, b; Sugiyama 2004a, b;

constructions; this and other parallels suggest that similar rituals took place in both
(Gómez 2013; Sugiyama and Sarabia 2011; N. Sugiyama et al. 2013, p. 409).
Sugiyama and Sarabia (2011) recently confirmed the existence of older structures
and Patlachique ceramics in the Sun Pyramid’s fill (N. Sugiyama et al. 2013;
Sugiyama 2012, pp. 219–222). Their radiocarbon assays indicate the construction of
the pyramid was later than previously thought, perhaps AD 229–330. If the
Patlachique and Tzacualli phases are this late, this compression of the Teotihuacan
chronology carries significant implications. Although it may be premature at present
to revise the Teotihuacan chronology, it is important to resolve the dating of the
early and late phases of the Teotihuacan period.
Cowgill’s (1996) chronology places the destruction and desecration of the city’s
major buildings ca. AD 650. Manzanilla (2003, p. 96; see also Hueda-Tanabe et al.
2004; Solar 2006a) draws on archaeomagnetic dates to conclude that the burning
and elite collapse happened a century earlier, ca. AD 550. Beramendi-Orosco et al.’s
(2009) dates from Teopancazco also put the end of the Xolalpan phase at cal AD
550, as does Cowgill, but he sees good evidence that the major burning occurred at
the end of the Metepec phase, ca. AD 650. Given the extensive burning along the
Street of the Dead (Millon 1988, pp. 149–152), future work should obtain sufficient
dates from enough secure contexts to resolve this issue.
Ecology, Environment, and Economy
Cultural ecology framed the Basin of Mexico settlement pattern surveys that began
in the Teotihuacan Valley under Sanders (Sanders et al. 1979; see also Nichols
1996) and continues to provide a useful framework (e.g., Evans 2008). Recent
research on human and environmental relations focuses less on the concepts of
adaptation and ecosystems and more on the dynamics of human–environmental
interactions and historical ecology (McClung de Tapia 2005, 2012). The causes and
effects of environmental change are receiving broad attention from archaeologists
who propose that environmental factors contributed to Teotihuacan’s growth and
decline. Multidisciplinary, paleo-environmental research in the Teotihuacan Valley
has been a focus of studies by McClung de Tapia (Adriano-Morán, and McClung de
Tapia 2008; Cabadas-Báez et al. 2005; Gama-Castro et al. 2004, 2005; GonzálezArqueros et al. 2013; McClung de Tapia 2005, 2012; McClung de Tapia et al. 2003,
2005a, b). More research is badly needed elsewhere in Teotihuacan’s hinterlands
(Córdova and Parsons 1996; Frederick et al. 2005).
Beginning ca. 150/100 BC, Teotihuacan grew rapidly and vied with Cuicuilco for
regional dominance (Charlton and Nichols 1997, pp. 181–182; Cowgill 2000b,
pp. 264–265). Relocation of much of the population of the Basin of Mexico and
other parts of central Mexico further fueled Teotihuacan’s growth during Tzacualli
times, AD 1–100 (Fig. 2). Conventional interpretations attribute the decline of
Cuicuilco to volcanic eruptions; however, better dating of the timing and number of
eruptions suggests otherwise (Córdova et al. 1994). Siebe (2000) places the final
lava flows over Cuicuilco to ca. AD 200/350 after most of that city was abandoned.
An earlier eruption of Popocatepetl in the middle of the first century degraded
agricultural lands, covered villages, and caused people to flee to Teotihuacan and

123

other urban centers and even might have blocked some of Cuicuilco’s trade routes
(Plunket and Uruñuela 2004, 2005, p. 95, 2006, 2012, p. 33). While coercion
(Spencer and Redmond 2004) and the pull of the growing city may explain the
abandonment of settlements elsewhere in the Basin of Mexico, volcanic eruptions
also contributed to population dislocations and the massive Terminal Formative
influx at Teotihuacan.
Beyond catastrophic environmental events, there is evidence of climatic cycling,
especially in the drier northern Basin of Mexico; slight differences in rainfall and
temperature can have significant consequences for agricultural productivity
(Cabadas-Báez et al. 2005; McClung de Tapia 2000; Metcalfe 2006; Metcalfe
and Davies 2007; Metcalfe et al. 2000, 2007). Solleiro-Rebolledo et al. (2006) argue
that increased aridity contributed to the early development of irrigation in the Basin.
Anthropogenic changes including erosion from swidden cultivation of hillsides
likely also encouraged the early use of irrigation in the northern Basin of Mexico
(Evans and Nichols in press; Nichols 1982, 1987; Plunket and Uruñuela 2012,
p. 10).
Concerns about contemporary climate change have expanded support for climate
science research and the development of new paleo-climatic models for central
Mexico. Lachiniet et al. (2012) and Stahle et al. (2011) argue that drought
contributed to the social and cultural changes from the Classic to the Postclassic.
McClung de Tapia (2012), however, has not found evidence in the Teotihuacan
Valley for drought-induced environmental changes. There is no simple correlation
between social and climate changes as new centers were founded while others
retracted during dry periods (Bhattacharya et al. 2015). Further understanding of
cultural and climatic changes requires more direct collaboration between climatic
scientists and archaeologists.
McClung and colleagues have looked at Teotihuacan’s impacts on its environment (Cabrera 2005; McClung de Tapia 2003, 2004, 2005, 2012; McClung de Tapia
et al. 2003, 2005a, b). Streams tapped for irrigation were rerouted to accommodate
the city’s grid, and urban growth removed some farmland from production (Evans
and Nichols in press; Nichols et al. 1991, pp. 127–128, 2006). As farmers intensified
cultivation of the alluvial plain and piedmont slopes surrounding the city in the
Terminal Formative, they removed vegetation, increasing erosion and sedimentation
(McClung de Tapia 2003; McClung de Tapia and Aguilar 2001, pp. 114–115). The
availability of fuel also might have declined (Biskowski’s 1997). The diverse mixed
tree and shrub wood used by Teotihuacanos, however, remained relatively stable
during the Teotihuacan and Postclassic periods, which suggests that Teotihuacanos
managed the growth and consumption of vegetation for fuel (Adriano-Morán and
McClung de Tapia 2008) and that the major post-Pleistocene vegetation and soil
changes took place earlier in the Formative period when people first cultivated hill
slopes (Nichols 2007).
Teotihuacan’s environmental footprint extended beyond its immediate hinterland. Limestone for plaster was quarried from the Tula area in the Mezquital Valley
north of the Basin of Mexico and perhaps also from the Zumpango area of the
northern Basin (Barba et al. 2009; Murakami 2010, pp. 191–192). Barba and
Córdova (2010) estimate that a total of 12.2 million m3 of wood was required to

123

8

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

cook the limestone to produce the plaster used in Teotihuacan. This figure does not
include plaster for hinterland settlements (see also Barba 2005).
Manzanilla (2003) suggests that environmental degradation and drought
contributed to the city’s decline. Sanders (2003) disagreed, arguing that Teotihuacan
farmers cultivated hillsides using terraces to control erosion; without terraces, the
soil would have washed away centuries before Teotihuacan’s decline. ‘‘Any erosion
would have been the product of the decline of the population in the valley during the
Coyotlatelco phase’’ (Sanders 2003, p. 197). However, no early terracing in the
Teotihuacan Valley has been definitely dated to the Teotihuacan period. Environmental degradation is often linked with population growth, but where intensification
involves labor-intensive landscape modifications, such as terracing, a decline in the
labor force needed to maintain such features can cause serious deterioration as
happened after AD 1519 (Córdova 1997; Córdova and Parsons 1996; Fisher 2005).
Future studies at Teotihuacan have the potential to contribute much more to the
understandings of urbanism, environmental change, and long-term ecological
dynamics.
Cultivating Fields
The great concentration of people, including farmers, in the Teotihuacan Valley,
while perhaps politically expedient, carried risks. Farmers irrigated fields and
households practiced diversified production strategies, combining farming and craft
specialization and manufacturing multiple crafts (Stark 2007, pp. 230–233). Maize
was a staple crop; however, maguey cultivation played a more important role than
previously realized (e.g., Correa-Ascencio et al. 2014; McClung de Tapia 2003,
2004; McClung de Tapia and Tapia Recillas 1998). Aguamiel (maguey syrup) and
pulque (fermented syrup) were widely consumed. Maguey also provided fibers and
fuel (Parsons and Parsons 1990; Sheehy 2001). Concentrations of maguey scrapers
indicate that some farming households in the city and surrounding countryside
specialized in maguey cultivation and processing (Manzanilla 1996, p. 235, 2005a,
p. 176; Sanders 1994, p. 63; Sejourné 1966).
In contrast to other world regions where early states and cities developed,
prehispanic Mesoamerica lacked large domesticated animals. Nonetheless, Teotihuacanos took advantage of what animals were available. At the Oztoyahualco
apartment compound, for example, some families bred turkeys, dogs, and rabbits for
commerce and their own use (Manzanilla 1999b).
Too little is known about the farming practices and land tenure of Teotihuacan
households (Sanders et al. 1979, p. 125). Early estimates of the number of farmers
and craft specialists in the city should be revisited in light of findings that
households often engaged in multiple production strategies (Feinman 1999). By 150
BC, floodwater irrigation was widely practiced in the Teotihuacan Valley and
organized as small systems likely controlled by local corporate groups. Remains of
canals have been found in the city (Cabrera 2005; Evans and Nichols in press;
Nichols 1988; Nichols et al. 1991, 2006; Nichols and Frederick 1993; Sanders et al.
1979, pp. 263–269). Hydraulic engineering is evident in the rerouting of the San
Lorenzo and San Juan Rivers and other streams to accommodate the grid plan.

123

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

Although the ongoing cultivation of fields obscures prehispanic permanent
irrigation features, enough open land still remains in the Teotihuacan Valley to
make multispectral aerial imagery and geophysical remote sensing methods a
priority.
I agree with Scarborough (2003, p. 123) that the state’s involvement in water
management in the Basin of Mexico usually was temporary and limited to largescale projects. The massive state reorganization of Teotihuacan entailed significant
hydraulic modifications (Angulo 1987; Cabrera 2005; Evans and Nichols in press;
Parsons 1991, p. 36; Sugiyama 1993). Such projects created productive agricultural
land to support the growing urban population that leaders could strategically
allocate as rewards and also to immigrant groups and/or local farming households
displaced by urban growth. Irrigated fields also represented a secure source of
tribute revenue, although I suspect that water management was mostly the
responsibility of local groups. In contrast to Wittfogel’s (1957) despots, current
theories focus more on cooperation, corporate groups, and collective action
(Carballo et al. 2014b; Evans and Nichols in press).
Scarborough (2003, p. 119) sees chinampa development, not irrigation, as critical
to Teotihuacan’s nucleated growth and political centralization. Sanders (1976,
pp. 117–118; Sanders et al. 1979, p. 390) also thought that chinampas on a fairly
substantial scale were constructed around the San Juan springs in the Late or
Terminal Formative. Gamboa (2000) dates agricultural drainage canals to Late
Tlamimilolpa/Early Xolalpan and perhaps earlier. More recent work, however,
raises the possibility that these features date to the colonial period (McClung de
Tapia 2012). Hydraulic modifications of the area around the springs likely took
place in both prehispanic and colonial times.
Scarborough (2003) further speculates that canalization for chinampas inspired
Teotihuacan’s grid layout. Integrated orthogonal urban layouts, however, are not
confined to cities with drained fields, and considerable evidence links the orientation
of Teotihuacan’s grid to concepts of time, calendars, and cosmology (e.g., Cowgill
2007a; Galindo and Klapp 2009; Smith 2007, p. 16; Sugiyama 2002, 2010).
Chinampas are not yet securely dated to the city’s early history (Cabrera 2005). In
contrast to those (Parsons 1991, p. 36) who think that Teotihuacan’s rulers
developed deliberate strategies to manage agricultural land and labor, others (e.g.,
Cowgill 1997) posit a more decentralized political economy. With so many farmers
living in the city, land and water disputes must have been a regular feature of urban
and rural politics. Farming fields outside the city and managing groups displaced by
urban growth and the city’s reorganization would have provided leadership
opportunities for emerging intermediate elites early in the city’s history.
Teotihuacan’s rulers linked their political authority with the forces of agricultural
fertility (Heyden 2000, p. 180; Manzanilla 2000; Millon 1973, p. 301; Nichols et al.
2006, p. 64; Pasztory 1997, pp. 104–106). Farmers tilled fields watered by rain and
irrigation and propitiated these forces in their household rituals. Rulers also
conducted rituals essential to these life-sustaining forces on which their own power
depended.

Urban Craft Specialization
Specialization and exchange were integral in the early development of complex
societies that linked the Teotihuacan Valley with other regions of Mesoamerica
even before the city existed (Alex et al. 2012; Stoner et al. 2015). The intensification
of production and specialization and commercial/marketplace exchange were key
changes in the economy and social relations. Teotihuacan figures prominently in
debates about the relationship of politics and economics in the formation of early
states.
Specialists at Teotihuacan manufactured an array of utilitarian and sumptuary
goods (Table 2). They worked in various contexts within the city, in independent
and administered/attached workshops, and sponsored workshops as clients of
wealthy patrons (Manzanilla 2009). Most workshops were based in residences—as
they were across Mesoamerica in prehispanic times (Cowgill 2007a, pp. 283–284;
Feinman 1999)—although some were attached to state institutions (e.g., Carballo
2007b, 2011a; Múnera 1985). Households within the same apartment compound at

Teotihuacan usually engaged in the same occupations, and there are many examples
of multicrafting (e.g., Manzanilla 2006a; Sullivan 2004), often including farming.
At the Oztoyahualco apartment compound residents specialized in plaster polishing
and bred rabbits. Manzanilla’s (1996) identification of rooms that store seeds and
plants suggests the residents also farmed. Specialists who mass-produced some
kinds of goods lived together in their own neighborhoods or districts, while others
were scattered throughout the city (Cowgill 2007a). Manzanilla (2009) argues that
the specialists clustered in sectors on the city’s periphery geared their production to
supplying the urban population. Noble houses supervised the manufacturing of
wealth goods that marked social identities, and rulers also controlled embedded or
administered workshops that produced items important to their political authority,
such as obsidian weapons and ritual eccentrics at the Moon Pyramid workshops
(Carballo 2011b).
A comprehensive review of the varied scales and contexts of urban manufacturing is beyond the scope of this paper, but some examples of ceramic
manufacturing are instructive. Urban workshops specialized in making different
types of pottery and ceramic goods (Hopkins 1995; Meza and Sánchez 1998;
Rattray 2001). South of the San Lorenzo River is a district of apartment compounds
that manufactured San Martı́n Orange cooking pots and amphorae for storage,
perhaps of pulque (Correa-Ascencio et al. 2014; Sheehy 2001; Sullivan 2006;
Widmer and Storey 1993). These were independent workshops (Cabrera-Cortés
2011). We do not yet know if there were any formal organizations of specialists
crosscutting apartment compounds, although the cluster of potters in the Tlajinga
district suggests some supra-household organization. In Tlajinga 33, a few families
of lapidary specialists founded the compound in Early Tlamimilolpa. By Late
Xolalpan they manufactured San Martı́n Orange pottery as a compound-wide
activity (Hopkins 1995; Sheehy 1998; Widmer and Storey 1993). Manzanilla (2009,
p. 31) suggests that elite barrio centers such as La Ventilla took over lapidary
production for regalia, removing it from the hands of poorer, independent
specialists.
Independent potters did not just manufacture ‘‘utilitarian’’ ceramics but also
made ritually charged vessels. Cabrera-Cortés (2005) investigated such a ceramic
workshop, Site 520, on the southeast edge of the city with a firing area and
substantial quantities of manufacturing debris from bowls, cylindrical vessels, and
Storm God effigies. These potters lived in simple houses of stone, adobe, and
perishable materials. Although they did not build Teotihuacan-style compounds,
they followed Teotihuacan burial practices.
In contrast to residential workshops of the relatively poor independent potters at
Tlajinga 33 and Site 520, other potters manufactured composite theater censers and
adornos in a walled enclosure attached to the north side of the Ciudadela (Cowgill
2007a, p. 283; Múnera 1985). These fancy censers were ceremonial items linked
with political authority (Carballo 2011a, p. 29; Manzanilla 2009, p. 31). Specialists
working as part of a rotational labor tax also could have left the manufacturing
debris found in state buildings. This would explain the presence of manufacturing
debris (of censers and other types of ritually charged goods) in both residences and
public structures (Cabrera-Cortés 2011; Carballo 2011b, p. 148; Múnera 1985;

123

12

Sullivan 2007). Through attached craft production and/or labor taxes, leaders
asserted some control over the production of objects and symbols associated with
their political authority and sacred propositions of war, sacrifice, and their ancestors.
The scale and methods of manufacturing intensified as the city grew. At Cosotlan
23, 1 km west of the Moon Pyramid, potters initially shaped figurines by hand.
Later, during the Tlamimilolpa phase, they began to mass-produce them using
molds (Barbour 1975; Goldsmith 2001; Sullivan 2007). Sullivan (2006, 2007)
recovered over 6,000 figurine fragments along with molds in surface collections and
documented the shift to mass production. Figurine production continued at Cosotlan
23 into the Postclassic, though on a smaller scale.
Textiles held an important place in the political economy of Mesoamerica and as
multivalent expressions of identity. Cabrera-Cortés (2001) thinks few raw fibers
were processed in the city; most fiber came into Teotihuacan as yarn/thread.
Ceramic spindle whorls do not appear until the Epiclassic. In surface collections at
Cosotlan 23, Sullivan (2007) recovered significant numbers of small, perforated
ceramic disks with holes similar in size to later cotton spindle whorls. The
possibility that these may be ceramic spindle whorls warrants further investigation.
Molds standardize whorl sizes and, by extension, thread sizes and signal an
expanded role for textiles and greater specialization.
In the south-central Gulf Coast, spinners began to employ ceramic spindle whorls
by the Terminal Formative. During the Early Classic, the growing social
significance of textiles prompted increases in Gulf Coast cotton production, some
of which likely was exported to Teotihuacan, along with other Gulf Coast prestige
goods, including seashells and lustrous ware pottery. Stark et al. (1998, p. 28)
suspect cotton came to Teotihuacan through administered trade or elite gift
exchanges. Garments depicted on ceramic figurines and in murals and the presence
of tailors’ workshops in barrio centers such as Teopancazco and La Ventilla show
the social significance of cloth (Cabrera 1998; Barbour 1975; Goldsmith 2001;
Manzanilla 2006a; Romero 2003). Such fine textiles were worn by elites who also
exchanged them as gifts (Cowgill 2007a, p. 284).
Of Teotihuacan’s craft specialties, the obsidian industry has attracted the most
attention. Based on analyses of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project collections,
Spence in a series of articles in the 1980s (e.g., 1981, 1989) developed a model of
Teotihuacan’s urban obsidian industry that involved independent household, local,
and regional workshops, as well as state-administered precinct workshops (Table 2).
Santley (1983, 1984; Santley et al. 1986; see also Sanders and Santley 1983) carried
Spence’s model further to argue that Teotihuacan attempted to monopolize obsidian
production in Mesoamerica through discriminatory pricing and colonization. Clark
(1986, 2003) strongly criticized the models because the unsystematic surface
collections are not suitable for assessing the scale and intensity of obsidian
manufacturing. He felt this led archaeologists to exaggerate the scale of Teotihuacan
obsidian’s industry. Subsequent replication experiments indicate that a relatively
small number of knappers could have supplied the urban population and
surrounding settlements (e.g., Andrews 2006; Moholy-Nagy 1990).
In the face of Clark’s critique, Santley (Santley and Alexander 1992) modified
his position as his own analyses showed that most obsidian tools at rural sites in the

123

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

13

Teotihuacan Valley were not made at urban workshops (Santley et al. 1995).
Santley and Alexander (1992, 1996) suggest that Teotihuacan workshops produced
obsidian tools primarily for urban consumers and for export to Teotihuacan’s
hinterlands and that the intensity of Teotihuacan’s foreign trade in obsidian was less
than Santley had previously supposed. Spence (1996a) argued that most obsidian
objects from the Basin of Mexico in the Maya lowlands during the Early Classic
were distributed as gifts and played only a minor role in the Teotihuacan obsidian
industry, although such exchanges might have been important in sustaining
economically valuable relationships (Spence 1996a, p. 35; White et al. 2001).
Important new research on the scale of obsidian consumption and manufacturing
at Teotihuacan addresses Clark’s critique. Andrews (2002) analyzed a concentration
on the northeast edge of the city and confirmed Spence’s (1986, p. 4) interpretation
that knappers there imported macrocores to make prismatic cores and blades,
projectile points, eccentrics, and bifacial and unifacial tools. Andrews characterizes
the knappers as generalized specialists. He (2006) also examined the San Martı́n
obsidian concentration that Spence had identified as a possible regional workshop
and concluded that the specialists were not full-time, although they made a wide
range of obsidian goods (Andrade and Arellano 2011).
Spence also interpreted a surface concentration of obsidian in the large-walled
plaza attached to the west side of the Moon Pyramid as a state-administered
workshop for making darts. Carballo’s (2007b, 2011a) analyses support Spence’s
interpretation; the excavated concentrations represent episodic workshop dumps—
similar to those at Tula (Healan 1992, p. 240)—from manufacturing military darts,
bipointed knives, and eccentrics used in pyramid offerings. We now know that the
Aztec practice of placing armories and weaponry workshops in temple precincts that
outfitted elite military orders dates back to at least Teotihuacan times (Carballo
2011a; Garcı́a-Des Lauriers 2008; Hassig 1988, p. 105).
Some surface concentrations identified by Spence represent loci where obsidian
tools were consumed in large amounts in other manufacturing activities. Many
blades were used, not manufactured, at Cosotlan 23 where figurines were made
(Sullivan 2007). Similarly, in the Merchants’ Barrio obsidian tools were used in
some undetermined production involving hematite (Iceland 1989, p. 125).
Most obsidian at Teotihuacan came from the nearby Otumba (Barranca de los
Estetes) source or the Pachuca source prized for its high-quality green obsidian.
Limited geochemical studies have been done of obsidian from Teotihuacan (see
Carballo 2012, p. 122), but they confirm attributions to these sources based on
surface color. Preforms and tools were manufactured in Classic period-apartment
compounds and camps at the Pachuca source for export to the city and elsewhere
(Pastrana and Domı́nguez 2009).
When Millon designed the Teotihuacan Mapping Project in the 1960s, lithic
studies had not yet incorporated replication experiments and analysis of reduction
sequences (Healan 2002). Although the Mapping Project collections are not suitable
to determine the scale and intensity of manufacturing, they successfully identified
unusual obsidian concentrations. Cobean (2002, p. 199) thinks the problems with
survey collections have been exaggerated and points out that the tons of obsidian
imported along with Thin Orange and other nonlocal pottery suggest the existence

123

14

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

of distribution systems that transported substantial volumes of goods over great
distances. The recent findings of dense subsurface deposits of obsidian debris at
Teotihuacan and technological analyses bear out Cobean’s point (Carballo 2011a,
pp. 121–124). Both independent and state-administered workshops as Spence
proposed were present. Ongoing investigations in the Tlajinga include excavations
of residential obsidian workshops designed to collect data to model the scale of
core-blade manufacturing (Carballo et al. 2014a).
Distribution Systems
The variety of urban craft workshops, wide distribution of goods and raw materials,
size of the urban population, and scale of state institutions indicate the operation of
multiple distribution systems, including commercial and marketplace exchange,
administered trade, and some system of state finance/tax (Kurtz 1987; Murakami
2015). Identifying market systems requires configurational/locational, distributional, and contextual evidence (Hirth 1998). Research at Teotihuacan has focused
more on context and distribution. No marketplace has been unequivocally identified
at Teotihuacan. Millon (1992) thought the Great Compound held the central
marketplace, but this has not been tested. Archaeologists have developed protocols
at lowland Maya cities to identify marketplaces that could be applied at Teotihuacan
(Chase and Chase 2014; Coronel et al. 2015).
Manzanilla (1997) previously doubted that marketplace exchange and tribute
systems had developed at Teotihuacan and proposed a ‘‘temple-centered’’ redistribution model where priests controlled craft specialization and long-distance trade.
Others counter that temple-centered redistribution alone could not have met the
needs of a city as large as Teotihuacan (Blanton et al. 1993, pp. 212–213; Cowgill
2001b, p. 15; Kurtz 1987; Millon 1992, pp. 376–377; Sanders and Santley 1983;
Spence 1987; Trigger 2003, pp. 374, 403). Compositional studies of ceramics
indicate market exchange between regional centers in the Basin of Mexico, as well
as with Teotihuacan (Clayton 2013; Nichols et al. 2013). Manzanilla (2009) argued
that barrio centers organized as noble houses of intermediate elites perhaps oikos
economies centered on patron–client relations. She suggests that the collapse of
Teotihuacan triggered greater separation of the economy from the control of
political elites, the growth of tributary states, and the development of marketplace
exchange. Resolving debates about Teotihuacan’s economy will require a multimethod approach, including expanded application of geochemical source studies,
continuing technological and contextual studies of craft production, and an effort to
identify marketplaces, even if such evidence is ambiguous (Chase and Chase 2014).
Teotihuacan was a primate city par excellence—leading archaeologists to
presume that it’s regional economy was highly centralized and politically dominated
by the capital. Millon (1981, p. 221; also Sanders et al. 1979) saw exchange
relations between Teotihuacan and its inner hinterland (the Basin of Mexico)
organized as a solar market system with little horizontal flow of goods:
‘‘Administrative intervention in the exchange process may have been an important
source of state revenues.’’ Santley (1983, Santley and Alexander 1992, 1996;
Santley et al. 1986) argued for a dendritic central place system. The initial

123

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

15

advantages of concentrating the Basin’s population in the city, including farming
households, outweighed the costs of underdeveloping some of its hinterlands,
especially the southern Basin where rainfall is higher and maize farming less risky.
Such a strategy would have facilitated direct state control over production while
simplifying redistribution (Parsons 1991, p. 39). Even those who see marketplace
exchange as one aspect of Teotihuacan’s economy often think it existed in the
context of strong political control.
Models of Teotihuacan’s relations with its hinterlands, however, require more
testing. Recent compositional studies show there were multiple ceramic-production
zones in the Basin of Mexico that made Teotihuacan-style pottery. Azcapotzalco,
the next largest regional center in the Basin, and Cerro Portezuelo, a minor center in
the southeast Basin of Mexico, both manufactured pottery similar to that produced
at Teotihuacan (Branstetter-Hardesty 1978; Clayton 2013; Ma 2003; Nichols et al.
2002, 2013). Portezuelo was first occupied in the Late Formative and likely was not
founded by Teotihuacan (Clayton 2013; Nichols et al. 2013). Although exchange
with Teotihuacan increased as the city expanded, Teotihuacan did not dominate
Cerro Portezuelo’s economy. Cerro Portezuelo also had important exchange
relations with the western Basin of Mexico (likely with Azcapotzalco) and imported
obsidian from Michoacán as well as Pachuca (Parry and Glascock 2013). The
compositional data suggest the development of overlapping market networks within
the Basin of Mexico and horizontal exchanges of ceramics between smaller centers.
In the face of recent findings, we now must reconsider the dominance often
attributed to Teotihuacan over the regional economy (e.g., Benitez 2008; Golitko
and Feinman 2015, p. 221).
Stark et al. (1998) proposed that early states of the Classic period in Mesoamerica
encouraged specialization and markets within their immediate domains but doubt
that market exchange between independent polities was significant. For others
(Blanton 1983; Blanton et al. 1993, pp. 210–214; Manzanilla 1997, Smith 2004,
p. 93), specialists and entrepreneurs intensified market exchange and commerce
across and within political boundaries when Teotihuacan and other regional Classic
states collapsed. Trigger (2003) argued for the early development of markets in citystate systems. The many farmers who lived in cities created demand for goods,
which encouraged craftworkers to make higher-quality goods available to all, not
just for the government and upper classes (Trigger 2003, p. 403). On the other hand,
Brumfiel and Earle (1987) linked the emergence of markets to elites and financing
state economies. Teotihuacan significantly influenced but did not centrally control
the regional economy, and current work is clarifying its commercial and tribute
systems.
Households, Compounds, and Neighborhoods
The reorganization of Teotihuacan following the influx of people was an audacious
effort to create a new sense of place within a structured political landscape (Smith
2003, p. 168). Between AD 200 and 300, the multifamily apartment compound
replaced earlier types of urban residences. The apartment compound, unique to
Teotihuacan, became ‘‘the most well defined integrated unit in the city’s structure’’

123

16

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

(Spence 2002, p. 54; also Millon 1976). Domestic rituals, the burial of ancestors in
apartment compounds, shared occupations and ethnicities, and marriage and kinship
ties connected the daily lives of people residing in the same compound and the
apartment compound linked them to the Teotihuacan state (Manzanilla 2002a, b,
2004c; Manzanilla et al. 1999; Manzanilla and Serrano 1999). In reorganizing the
city, the Teotihuacan state not only created something new but also drew on familiar
village architecture that Angulo (2007, pp. 93–94) and Plunket and Uruñuela
(2002a, b) link with lineage organization. Older forms include the three-temple
complex and talud and tablero facades, ‘‘a symbolic divide between the
underground quarters of the deceased’’ and their living descendants who occupy
the surface (Plunket and Uruñuela 2005, p. 98). Angulo (2007) suggests that threetemple complexes served as chiefly civic and administrative centers and that early
governance at Teotihuacan consisted of a coalition of chiefs.
Many think a corporate house model rather than lineages better characterizes the
organization of apartment compounds, although the distinction between them
perhaps has been overplayed (Cowgill 2008a, b; Manzanilla 2009; Watanabe 2004).
The composition of apartment compounds shows some flexibility (Carballo 2011b,
p. 154). They became a signature of urban life at Teotihuacan but apparently did not
persist beyond the collapse of the Teotihuacan state. The 2,000? apartment
compounds in the city housed both rich and poor, nobles and commoners. They
provided a standardized residential form but varied internally and expressed status,
class, occupational, and ethnic differences between families within and between
compounds in the city and hinterlands (Manzanilla 2006a, 2009; Millon 1976;
Sanders 2008). Rural villages in the Teotihuacan Valley also were heterogeneous.
Recent excavations near Acolman found Teotihuacan apartment compounds, but
with dirt floors (also present at Tlajinga 33), while compounds were plastered in
other rural villages (Charlton 2000; Charlton and Charlton 2007; Charlton et al.
2002, 2005). Moreover, not all Teotihuacanos lived in apartment compounds. An
example of what Robertson (2008) calls ‘‘insubstantial structures’’ is Site 520, with
houses built mostly of perishable materials (Cabrera-Cortés 2005).
Sanders and Evans (2005, p. 305) argue that such smaller households form a
larger proportion of Teotihuacan residences than usually thought and that middle/
intermediate class families occupied most apartment compounds in the city. If so,
Teotihuacan had an unusually large intermediate class for a preindustrial city;
Sanders and Evans (2006) speculate they controlled agricultural land in the
Teotihuacan Valley cultivated by tenant farmers, many of whom were immigrants.
Manzanilla (2009) also suspects patron–client relations were important in the
economies of barrio centers. Craft specialization, the special political and religious
role of the city, and the military also contributed to the growth of its intermediate
class.
Apartment compounds of intermediate elites, such as Teopancazco, also housed
servants, retainers, and specialists of lower status (Manzanilla 2006a, 2015). At
Teopancazco, specialists made clothing, regalia, and jewelry for wealthy patrons.
The La Ventilla barrio provides another view of intermediate elites (Cabrera 1998;
Cabrera and Gómez 2008; Gómez 2000; Gómez and Núñez 1999).

123

17

Within a compound, each family occupied its own suite of rooms for cooking,
dining, storage, and sleeping, as well as areas for conducting funerary rites and
burying their dead. Patios were centers of household religious cults focused on
patron or domestic deities (Manzanilla 2002a, b, 2009). The interdisciplinary
approach developed by Manzanilla (2005a, 2015) and colleagues to identify
activities in Teotihuacan apartment compounds offers a valuable model more
generally for household archaeology. Along with work, kinship, and ethnicity, as
shared experiences, rituals also fostered a corporate identity among compound
members, reinforced their responsibilities to ancestors, and socialized the next
generation (Barba and Manzanilla 2007; Manzanilla 2002a, b; Sempowski 1994,
1999). Some Teotihuacan state rituals had parallels and roots in household and
compound practices. Termination rituals were not exclusive to state or public
buildings but also were practiced when apartment compounds were remodeled or
abandoned—this illustrates how leaders at Teotihuacan and in other early states
appropriated household rituals, paraphernalia, and symbols (Carballo 2007a;
Carballo and Pluckhahn 2007; Manzanilla 2002a, b, c; Plunket and Uruñuela
2002a, b).
Teotihuacanos marked their connection to their residences by burying some of
their deceased members there (Cabrera 1999a, b; Cid and Torres 1999; Sempowski
1994, p. 30). Although burials associated with state buildings, such as the sacrificed
warriors at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid, have received much attention,
Teotihuacan burials and mortuary practices in residential contexts also have been
the subject of important recent studies that provide a wealth of information about
social relations, ethnicity, health and demography, and ritual practices (Brumfiel
1998; Cabrera 1999a, b; Clayton 2007, 2009, 2011; Gómez and Núñez 1999;
Headrick 1999; Manzanilla 2002b, 2005c; Manzanilla and Serrano 1999; Storey
2006).
Status differences existed within as well as between apartment compounds
(Cowgill 1997, p. 137–138; Manzanilla 2004b, 2009), even in compounds of
relatively low status. Widmer and Storey (1993) think most statuses at Tlajinga 33
were linked to achievement. They attribute a reduction over time in burial offerings
to a decline in the overall status of the apartment compound, possibly associated
with a shift from lapidary working to making San Martı́n Orange pottery. They
conjecture that mass production of standardized pottery provided less opportunity
for individual status distinctions. Although males dominated higher statuses within
Tlajinga 33, women held a considerable range of statuses; some were buried with
impressive offerings (Storey and Widmer 1999).
Until recently, Teotihuacan studies had not contributed much to understanding
gender relations in early states. Only a handful of articles on Teotihuacan focus on
gender (Brumfiel 1998; De Lucia 2008; Clayton 2011; Hendon 1999; Joyce 2000;
Sempowski 1994; Spence and Gamboa 1999; Spence et al. 2005). One reason is the
limited depiction of individuals in Teotihuacan iconography, coupled with the
absence of royal dynastic texts. Sempowski (1994, pp. 178–180) emphasizes
differences between men and women in burial offerings especially in the richest
graves. Others see less disparity, especially among groups within the city and
between the city and hinterlands, even though there were gender differences in

123

18

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

mortuary rituals between groups (Clayton 2009, 2011). Brumfiel (1998) and De
Lucia (2008) argue that social thought did not emphasize gender differences in
Teotihuacan society. Brumfiel reasoned that the Teotihuacan state focused on lines
of authority within apartment compounds, with heads of compounds serving as
intermediaries between the state and households. Consistent with Teotihuacan’s
corporate emphasis and notions of collectivity, compound identity was often more
important than marked expressions of individuality (De Lucia 2008).
Women buried at Tlailotlacan held high status within the Oaxaca Barrio, which
Spence and Gamboa (1999) attribute to the especially important role they played in
the biological and social reproduction of the Zapotec enclave as a minority
community. Maintaining Zapotec mortuary practices in tombs provided greater
opportunity for the expression and reinforcement of authority than Teotihuacan
burials in simple individual pits (Spence and Gamboa 1999, p. 193). Women in the
Merchants’ Barrio also generally had high status perhaps linked with textile
production (Spence et al. 2005, p. 179). Most women in the barrio were local,
whereas most of the men were immigrants. Foreign traders married local women
from prominent Teotihuacan families, and women enhanced their status by
managing their family’s affairs, including household rituals, when men were gone
on extended trading expeditions. Clearly, Teotihuacan offers great potential to refine
theories of gender relations and state formation; examining patterns of disease,
health, and stress across gender, class, and ethnicity and between the city and its
hinterlands are avenues deserving fuller exploration.
Immigration played an important role in the city’s growth and its multiethnic
composition, which included ethnic barrios. The well-known Oaxaca (Zapotec)
Barrio and the Merchants’ Barrio continue to be the subject of research (Croissier
2007; Gómez and Gazzola 2009; Rattray 2001, 2004, Spence 2002, 2005; Spence
et al. 2004, 2005; White et al. 2000b, 2004a). We now have a much richer view of
the city’s ethnic complexity and immigration, including from western Mexico,
Oaxaca, the Gulf Lowlands, and central Mexico (Gómez 2002; Manzanilla 2011,
2015; Michelet and Pereira 2009; Plunket and Uruñuela 2012; Price et al. 2000;
Spence 2005; Spence et al. 2004, 2013; White et al. 2002, 2003, 2007). Gómez
(2002; Gómez and Gazzola 2007, 2009) has identified a West Mexico barrio near
the Zapotec barrio on the western periphery of Teotihuacan (White et al. 2004a).
Taube (2003) discusses the Maya presence at Teotihuacan (Clayton 2005; Rattray
2005). Biogenetic studies (e.g., Álvarez-Sandoval 2014) have opened a new window
on ancient migration and Teotihuacan’s relationship with both its hinterlands and
more distant areas; such immigration had economic, political, social, and
demographic dimensions that have yet to be fully explored.
Within the urban heterogeneity of Teotihuacan, over time, neighborhoods
became more homogeneous (Robertson 2001, 2005). Increasing residential
segregation would have added to social tensions in the city, although wealth
differences between apartment compounds were not greatly marked (Smith et al.
2014). Another source of tension is the contradiction between the multiethnic city,
Teotihuacan’s corporate ideology and strategy, and the growing importance of
intermediate elites (Manzanilla 2006a).

Palaces and Governance
At the upper end of Teotihuacan’s heterogeneous society were rulers whose palaces
have been the subject of recent discussions (Cowgill 2003a, 2006; Evans 2006;
Manzanilla et al. 2005; Sanders and Evans 2005). Early excavations often did not
distinguish room functions, which complicate identifying palaces at Teotihuacan
(Manzanilla 2004c, p. 141). The first candidates are the compounds that flank the
north and south sides of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid inside the Ciudadela, both
with very symmetrical plans (Cowgill 2007a; Sanders and Evans 2006). Their
symmetry suggests some form of dual leadership, but Sanders and Evans (2006)
express reservations about these buildings because their layout is not consistent with
the range of activities—social, residential, and bureaucratic—found in a palace (also
Cowgill 1983). Kowalski (1999) finds the absence of mural paintings in these
buildings odd for a royal palace. Murals, however, were present in the early but not
the latest stages of the buildings, consistent with a change in function (de la Fuente
1995). The termination of the Feathered Serpent Temple signaled a change in
governance, and the royal palace shifted to the Avenue of the Dead Complex
between the Ciudadela and Sun Pyramid, the second and clearest candidate for a
Teotihuacan palace (Cowgill 2007a; Sanders and Evans 2006).
The 12-ha Avenue of the Dead complex created: ‘‘a city within a city, a little like
the Forbidden City of Late Imperial Beijing’’ Cowgill (2007a, p. 290). It offers
residential spaces and a multitude of facilities for other functions that are expected
of a palace. The idea that the Temple of the Feathered Serpent was associated with
an early cult of rulership at Teotihuacan has gained wide acceptance (Cabrera et al.
1991; Cowgill 1997, pp. 151–152; Millon 1992; Sugiyama 2002; 2004a, 2005).
Following this line of reasoning, Cowgill (2007a, p. 290) and others (Sanders and
Evans 2005, 2006, p. 267) see the move to the Avenue of the Dead complex as a
rejection of a rulership cult and change to more depersonalized, corporate
bureaucrats. This scenario is certainly plausible, although even in its early history,
Teotihuacan rulers were never as personified as Classic Maya kings and queens.
Hoopes (2005, p. 9) interjects a cautionary note with examples where corporate and
network strategies would not be easily distinguished on the basis of archaeological
remains.
The Xalla complex, a walled enclosure between the Sun and Moon Pyramids that
includes 4.5 ha of plazas, platforms, and pyramids (López Luján et al. 2005b;
Manzanilla and López Luján 2001), is a third candidate for a palace at Teotihuacan
(Cowgill 2007a, pp. 290–291; Manzanilla 2006a, p. 34). It might have been the
ruler’s palace before the Ciudadela became the city’s administrative center (Sanders
and Evans 2006, p. 256). However, Xalla’s construction began in Early Tlamimilolpa, a little later than the initial construction of the complexes flanking the
Feather Serpent Pyramid. If so, then where did Teotihuacan’s rulers reside in the
early part of the city’s history? Another possible palace, the Plaza de las Columnas,
includes the tallest unexcavated buildings in the city and is under investigation by
Saburo and Nawa Sugiyama.
Manzanilla (2006a) focuses on another aspect of Teotihuacan governance—
intermediate elites and barrio centers. She sees formal barrio or neighborhood

123

20

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

divisions within the city as important; each barrio had its own central apartment
compound occupied by intermediate elites that sponsored full-time specialists.
Cowgill (2007a) is less sure about the significance of barrio organization.
Manzanilla (2007, 2009) argues Teopancazco represents a barrio center. Excavations confirm that the compound supported attached/sponsored craft specialists
(tailors) who made regalia and headdresses for priests and the military with
imported materials from the Gulf Coast. Teopancazco even imported fish from the
Gulf Coast (Galicia and Azúa 2013). She argues that powerful houses such as
Teopancazco developed their own direct relations with other regions to obtain goods
and raw materials, unmediated by state authorities or the Merchants’ Barrio, which
contributed to the fragmentation of Teotihuacan’s corporate structure during the
Xolalpan phase (Manzanilla 2009).
In an innovative approach to studying bureaucracy, Murakami (2015) calculated
labor expenditures for construction of apartment compounds and major state
buildings and analyzed the use of cut stone and lime plaster. Based on his labor
calculations, some form of corvée labor must have developed at Teotihuacan. In
Tlamimilolpa and Early Xolalpan, use of cut stone blocks was highly restricted to
major public buildings, but by Late Xolalpan times intermediate-status compounds
had the wealth and positioning to directly obtain such restricted materials. At the
same time, the compositional variation in lime plaster increased markedly,
suggesting wider access to the raw materials and production. Murakami (2010)
argues that these changes reflect less central control of state bureaucracy. Increasing
commerce also could have contributed to these trends.
Intermediate elites include military officials, and the late 20th century saw a
growing recognition both theoretically and empirically of the importance of the
military and sacrifice at Teotihuacan and warfare as a strategy of the Teotihuacan
state (Cabrera 2002; Cabrera et al. 1991; Carballo 2011a; Cowgill 2003b; Headrick
2003, 2007; Stanton and Brown 2003; Sugiyama 2005; Sugiyama and López Luján
2006a; White et al. 2002). Spencer and Redmond (2004) argue that aggressive
territorial expansion was a key element in the formation and development of the
Teotihuacan state. To carry out conquests and maintain control of conquered areas
requires both a powerful military and an effective administrative structure that
tribute from conquered areas could have financed (Spencer and Redmond 2004,
p. 194).
The Teotihuacan military likely formed ranked orders that Headrick (2007,
p. 190) suggests were associated with temples as in Aztec times (Carballo 2011a;
Garcı́a-Des Lauriers 2008). She sees the Teotihuacan military as a unifying force
that crosscut kin groups. The military also likely provided opportunities for upward
mobility including for foreign-born persons, a pattern also seen in modern societies
with large numbers of immigrants (Hassig 1992; Spence et al. 2004, pp. 12–13).
Cowgill (1997, p. 145) cautions not to underestimate the motivational power of
ideology.
Headrick argues that Teotihuacan governance involved a triad of a king and the
military orders of bird and canine warriors. Others continue to think Teotihuacan
governance was based on dual leadership (e.g., Manzanilla 2004c, p. 140; Sanders
and Evans 2006). Cowgill (2007b) and Millon (1992) favor a single ruler, perhaps

123

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

21

selected by a council of leading families or other collective form of governance.
Cowgill (2011) recently proposed that a ruler elected/chosen by a council, a
Teotihuacan republic, replaced earlier hereditary rulers, a change consistent with
collective action theory (Carballo et al. 2014b).
Pyramids, Politics, Religion, and Ideology
Politics and religion were intertwined in all early states; there has been so much
recent research on this subject that the first Teotihuacan Mesa Redonda was devoted
to ideology and politics (Ruiz 2002). Following the Feathered Serpent Project,
archaeologists began new investigations around and inside the Moon Pyramid
(Cabrera 2009; Cabrera and Sugiyama 2004, 2009; Spence and Pereira 2007;
Sugiyama and Cabrera 2007) and the Sun Pyramid (Sugiyama and Sarabia 2011; N.
Sugiyama et al. 2013). Gómez’s (2013) ongoing excavations of the tunnel to the
Feathered Serpent Pyramid inside the Ciudadela have drawn international attention
(INAH 2014). These projects grew out of interests to better understand the nature of
Teotihuacan rulership and ideology and the history of these massive buildings.
The Moon Pyramid was the first of the three great pyramids to be built. It was
constructed in seven stages, with the fourth enlargement during the third century
AD representing a ninefold increase in size that implies a substantial increase in
political centralization (Sugiyama and Cabrera 2007, p. 123). The current urban grid
system was established by this time. Four burial complexes, each with one or more
sacrificial victims and wealth objects, have been excavated but none of them
appears to be the tomb of a ruler. For Cowgill (2008a), this leaves open the question
of whether Teotihuacan had a king or some other form of governance.
Burial 5 includes the highest-ranking grave yet found at Teotihuacan and the first
from the top rather than the bottom of a pyramid. Sugiyama and López Luján (2007,
p. 134) think the three individuals were very high-status foreigners, perhaps Maya
rulers, warriors, merchants, or ambassadors, brought back to Teotihuacan as war
captives (White et al. 2007). Such sacrifices were a statement of state military power
and authority (Sugiyama and López Luján 2007, p. 142). Both wild and captive
powerful carnivores also were sacrificed (N. Sugiyama 2013; N. Sugiyama et al.
2015; Valdez et al. 2010). Sacrifices in public buildings were part of ceremonies that
commemorated important events (Cabrera and Serrano 1999). Perhaps the
expansions of the Moon Pyramid were linked with inaugurations of rulers and/or
major conquests?
Teotihuacan was a place of origins, the first Tollan (Carrasco et al. 2000b). The
Sun Pyramid overlies an artificial cave and is associated with the Storm God, time,
astronomy, the sun, and the Pleiades (Aveni 2000; Millon 1993, p. 35; Sload 2007;
Sugiyama 2005; N. Sugiyama et al. 2013, p. 409). Because of these associations,
Fash et al. (2009, p. 213) posit the pyramid’s semi-detached platform, or adosada,
as the site of New Fire ceremonies. The New Fire ceremonies were undertaken not
only at the end of a 52-year cycle but when new cities, houses, and temples were
founded and new authorities came to power. Thus, the Sun Pyramid was a place of
investiture and pilgrimage.

123

22

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

The Feathered Serpent Pyramid was the last large temple added to the Street of
the Dead ca. AD 200–250; its façade links the creation of a watery underworld with
sacred warfare and sacrifice and authority and rulership (Sugiyama 2002, 2004a, b,
2005, Sugiyama et al. 2004). Dedication of this temple included offerings of
elaborately sacrificed warriors, some of whom had lived at Teotihuacan since
childhood, while others moved to Teotihuacan from elsewhere but resided in or
around the city (White et al. 2002). Half the sacrificed warriors had lived in a
foreign locale some time during their lives. Perhaps they were war captives. Cowgill
(2008a) suggests from their attire that they were foreigners selected to be royal
guards.
The central tomb of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid had been tunneled into and
looted in Teotihuacan times (Cabrera 1999a, 2004; Cabrera and Cowgill 2002;
Cabrera and Serrano 1999; Cowgill 1998, 2001a). Cowgill (1997) and Millon (1992,
p. 396) think a Teotihuacan ruler was buried there. Sugiyama (2005) suggested the
looted tomb was a multiple sacrificial burial and that the strongest candidate for a
royal tomb is a burial, also looted, in front of the pyramid. Millon (1992, p. 396), on
the other hand, speculated that it was the successor of the ruler who started the
pyramid who was buried there. Although the question of a royal tomb in the
Feathered Serpent Pyramid has yet to be resolved, these analyses offer new views of
Teotihuacan’s state ideology and new approaches to the archaeological analysis of
public architecture (Cowgill 2000a).
Shortly after the Feathered Serpent Pyramid was built, it was desecrated and
ritually terminated around AD 300, and the adosada was constructed. This series of
events is now generally accepted, perhaps too uncritically, as evidence of a change
to a more corporate form of rulership (Sugiyama et al. 2004; also Cabrera 2009;
Cabrera and Cowgill 2002). Ritual ideology as expressed by the pyramid’s
architecture and offerings connected early political authority at Teotihuacan with
creation of the watery underworld and sacred warfare and sacrifice.
Some scholars see the absence of depictions of Teotihuacan rulers as exceptional,
while others link it with a corporate worldview in contrast to lowland Classic Maya
kingdoms (e.g., Pasztory 1997). The lack of representations of rulers at Teotihuacan,
however, is not unique for prehispanic central Mexico or other world regions, such
as the Indus Valley. Alternatively, both Cowgill (1997) and Headrick (2007) think
scholars have failed to recognize representations of Teotihuacan rulers. Headrick
(2007, p. 96) proposes that imagery (much of it reconstructed) in the central portico
of the White Patio at Atetelco, which Millon (1992, p. 369, 1993, p. 31) interpreted
as a military ward, represents a king flanked by military orders. Pasztory (1997)
argued that Teotihuacan avoided individual representations to promote integration
and a utopian worldview. Cowgill (2008a, p. 968) counters, ‘‘Teotihuacan probably
was not utopian in any sense of the word.’’
Headrick (2007, p. 19) offers a different perspective that parallels Marxian views
of ideology: the unified worldview so promoted by the Teotihuacan state masked
divisions within Teotihuacan society. She argues that competition between lineages
or houses (Gillespie 2000) made it difficult for Teotihuacan’s rulers ‘‘to establish
incontestable dynasties; they forced them into a position of articulating their roles,
more than their individual personhood’’ (Headrick 2007, p. 70). This is an important

123

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

23

insight, although I find Headrick’s (2007) analogy to Islamic jihad misplaced
because all early state warfare had ritual and religious dimensions (Webster 1998).
She and Manzanilla (2006a; see also Cowgill 2007b) direct attention to divisions
within Teotihuacan society obscured by the façade of its political ideology. The fact
that Teotihuacan’s rulers were powerful does not mean Teotihuacan society was
devoid of factions and internal competition and tensions (Millon 1992, p. 340).
Following the work of Paulinyi (2001), Florescano (2006b, p. 297) suggests that the
lineage/faction associated with the tassled headdress and Tlaloc was the rival or
successor to the Plumed Serpent lineage and that these lineages/factions competed
for control of the city.
The reorganization of the city powerfully expressed Teotihuacan’s place in the
cosmos and the strength of its rulers (e.g., Cowgill 2002, 2007a; Morante López
2005; Sugiyama and Sarabia 2011; Šprajc 2000). It was an archetype of a
cosmogram that later states followed (Florescano 2006b). Sugiyama (2010, 2012)
sees evidence of a master plan that employed standardized units of measurement
with cosmological significance, although Millon (1992) and Cowgill (2007a) think
the city’s layout developed gradually. The influx of people to Teotihuacan provided
the labor and resources for this undertaking and a need to create a new expression of
state and society. Teotihuacan offers an early example of Scott’s (1998) state
strategies of legibility that try to standardize and simplify local practices and the
environment, to make societies more ‘‘legible’’ and governable. Teotihuacan
counters Scott’s (1998, p. 2) claim that early states were unable to devise such
strategies (Barbour and Millon 2005; Nichols 2007). Smith (2003), Yoffee (2005),
and Cowgill (2004) advocate seeing Teotihuacan and other early cities not simply as
derivative of economic, political, or other developments, but as having been created
to further the interests of powerful individuals and groups. The new state order at
Teotihuacan forged new arrangements of both public and domestic spaces to create
a new urban place. The large number of farmers and crafters living in ancient cities
such as Teotihuacan also shaped early urbanism (Trigger 2003, p. 403).
Just as Formative period villagers propitiated forces of fertility, Teotihuacan’s
rulers aligned themselves with such forces so vital to an agrarian society (Evans and
Nichols in press; N. Sugiyama et al. 2013). Pasztory (1997, pp. 84–94) argues that
the so-called Great Goddess represented the principal deity of Teotihuacan and was
associated with the Sun Pyramid, although Berlo (1992) linked the goddess with the
Moon Pyramid. In the best known depiction in the Tetitla murals, water, seeds, and
green stones flow forth from the hands. Recently, Paulinyi (2006) and Cowgill
(1997, pp. 145–150, 2007b), have challenged the status of the goddess as a central
state deity, its gender affiliation, and even whether the images represent a single
deity.
Hinterlands and the Teotihuacan State
By the first century AD, Teotihuacan had unified the Basin of Mexico politically
and become the capital of the Basin’s first integrated regional system (Charlton and
Nichols 1997, pp. 184–188; Millon 1981, pp. 221–222, 1988, p. 102, 1992, p. 344;
Sanders et al. 1979, p. 114). Formative-period patterns of community interaction in

123

24

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

the Basin coupled with the early development of production specialization and
reliance on irrigation foreshadowed subsequent collective action and, in the view of
Drennan and Haller (2007), the centralization of the Teotihuacan system (Carballo
et al. 2014b). The Teotihuacan state has been variously modeled as a city-state, a
regional state, an amalgam of elements of both a city-state and a regional state, a
hegemonic city-state, and an empire (Blanton et al. 1993, p. 135; Charlton and
Nichols 1997, p. 184; Cowgill 1999, 2001b; Hassig 1992; Manzanilla 1999a;
Trigger 2003, p. 97; Smith and Montiel 2001; Yoffee 1997). The varied
characterizations attempt to account for the high degree of urbanism and unusual
concentration of so much of the regional population in the city, along with the
presence of regional centers and hinterland villages with Teotihuacan-style
architecture and material culture to varying degrees and Teotihuacan’s dynamic
foreign interactions. One reason for these divergent interpretations is lack of
knowledge about the governance of regional centers, even in Teotihuacan’s own
hinterlands.
The unprecedented relocation of most of the Basin’s population, along with
immigrants from other parts of central Mexico and beyond to Teotihuacan and the
concentration of public building make Teotihuacan an exemplar of a primate
center—a capital of what many see as a highly centralized regional system,
economically, politically, and ideologically (Cowgill 2000b, pp. 263, 285, Cowgill
2001a, p. 725, 2001b, p. 14, 2003a, p. 38; Millon 1981, pp. 222–223; Sanders et al.
1979, p. 108). Soon afterward, the Basin was selectively resettled. Most
archaeologists view the resettlement as a state-administered recolonization program.
Sanders et al. (1979, p. 115) suggested they designed their strategy to break down
former loyalties by avoiding previous centers and to maximize resource exploitation, although the agriculturally rich southeastern Basin remained only lightly
occupied. Teotihuacan administered its immediate hinterlands either directly or
indirectly through secondary centers such as Azcapotzalco (Millon 1981, p. 222).
Primate systems typically impede the lateral flow of goods between regional centers
and lead to the development of solar market systems. At the time this model was
proposed, there were limited data from outside the northeastern Basin.
Garcı́a (2002; Garcı́a et al. 2005) directed excavations at Axotlan, a site near
Cuauhtitlan in the northwestern Basin of Mexico that Sanders (Sanders and
Gorenflo 2007; Sanders et al. 1979) designated a Teotihuacan administrative center
because of the presence of Teotihuacan-style apartment compounds. Artifacts,
architecture, rituals, and burial practices show close ties to Teotihuacan, probably
because of its interest in the permanent irrigation sources of the area (Clayton 2007,
2013; Garcı́a et al. 2005; Nichols 1980). Biogenetic analyses of burials would
contribute to better understanding of the founding of Axotlan and other regional
centers and their relationship to Teotihuacan. Unlike Axotlan, which was abandoned
after the Tlamimilolpa phase, Cerro de la Estrella expanded considerably during the
Epiclassic (Pérez 2004). Teotihuacan-style architecture and pottery, along with local
ceramic types (Nichols et al. 2013; Parsons et al. 1982) also have been found at
Huixtoco (Gamboa and Vélez 2005), another Tlamimilolpa phase settlement in the
southeast Basin.

123

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

25

Cerro Portezuelo was a small Teotihuacan period center in the southeast Basin
with occupations from the Late and Terminal Formative through the early colonial
period. It subsequently became one of the largest Epiclassic centers in the Basin. In
the 1950s, Brainerd found a buried Teotihuacan-period platform, along with burials,
offerings and domestic artifacts. No residences, contemporary with Teotihuacan,
however, were excavated, but poorly preserved Teotihuacan-style murals decorated
the platform (Clayton 2013; Hicks 2013; Nichols et al. 2013; Nicholson and Hicks
1961). Most Teotihuacan-style pottery at the site was made in the southeast Basin,
but Cerro Portezuelo also imported ceramics from Teotihuacan and the western
Basin, probably from Azcapotzalco where composition studies indicate Teotihuacan-style pottery also was produced (Clayton 2013; Garcı́a 2002, 2004; Ma 2003;
Nichols et al. 2013). Cerro Portezuelo imported obsidian from Michoacán and
Pachuca in the Teotihuacan period (Parry and Glasock 2013). Contrary to the solar
market model, lateral exchanges of goods took place between secondary and small
centers in the Basin. Cerro Portezuelo seems not to have been as closely connected
with Teotihuacan as Axotlan, perhaps because of the political marginality of the
southeast Basin, once part of Cuicuilco’s domain, to the Teotihuacan state system
(Nichols et al. 2013).
Teotihuacan-type apartment compounds have been found at rural sites in the
Teotihuacan Valley (Charlton 2000; Charlton et al. 2002, 2005; Charlton and
Charlton 2007; also Charlton 1987), along with evidence of local ceramic
manufacturing (Boulanger et al. 2008). The rural compounds, however, did not
all follow the Teotihuacan grid orientation, in contrast to the compounds at Axotlan,
perhaps an indication of closer state involvement with administrative centers such as
Axotlan. Occupants of rural sites and hinterland centers also were heterogeneous in
wealth and status, although the variation was not as great as in the city (Charlton
et al. 2005; Clayton 2009, 2013; Hicks 2013).
Findings from hinterland villages and centers reinforce Spence’s (2005) point
that we should not conflate politics and economics and not assume Teotihuacan
politics was necessarily dominant, despite the city’s position as a primate center.
Craft production was not restricted to Teotihuacan; composition studies document
multiple production zones in the Basin of Mexico for Teotihuacan-style ceramics,
and Teotihuacan was not the sole supplier of obsidian. Goods moved between
Teotihuacan and its hinterlands and vice versa, and goods also moved between
smaller centers in the Basin indicating that market exchange did not follow a solar
pattern. Subregional networks for ceramics perhaps developed as early as the LateTerminal Formative (Nichols et al. 2013).
Urbanism creates rural hinterlands that cities everywhere draw on—for goods,
resources, and people—and Teotihuacan was no exception. Teotihuacan had
administrative centers in the Basin of Mexico, and people with close ties to the city
occupied at least some of them (Clayton 2009, 2011, 2013). Although Teotihuacan
attracted migrants as a political, administrative, pilgrimage, and economic center,
most migration into the city probably was not directly controlled by the state.
Spence’s (2005) model of Zapotec enclaves in Early Classic central Mexico moves
archaeological thinking away from state-centric views of migration, ethnogenesis,
and early city-hinterland relations (Goldstein 2005). The flow of materials and

123

26

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

people from the hinterland to city is not automatic, and more attention should be
paid to Teotihuacan’s hinterlands. Disruption of such flows because of the growing
power of hinterland centers and elites and social tensions within the city likely were
important factors in Teotihuacan’s collapse (Manzanilla 2009, 2011). Comparison
of hinterland settlements would provide a fuller picture Teotihuacan society beyond
the city and the organization of the Teotihuacan state. Attention to chronology is
important to improve understanding the dynamics of its hinterland relations. Further
compositional along with stylistic and morphological analyses of ceramics,
obsidian, and other materials would provide new details of patterns of interaction.
A very important future research program lies in comparative isotopic and genetic
studies of burials from Teotihuacan’s hinterlands.

Foreign Relations and Interregional Interactions
Teotihuacan’s interregional relations continue to spark debate and have been the
subject of recent books and articles (Gómez and Spence 2013). Teotihuacan was a
multiethnic city. Rattray (2004, 2005) and Spence (1996b) discuss the Merchants’
Barrio, an enclave or colony with connections to the Gulf Coast and also to the
Maya region. Ruiz and Soto (2004) bring together papers dealing with the diverse
interactions between the Gulf Coast and Teotihuacan (also Cowgill and Neff 2004;
Daneels 2002). Arnold and Pool (2008) look at southern and central Veracruz
(Arnold and Santley 2008; Santley and Arnold 2004, 2005; Stark 2008). The
Zapotec enclave at Teotihuacan, where Croissier (2003, 2007) excavated a tworoom Oaxaca-style temple built with Teotihuacan construction techniques, was part
of a diaspora in central Mexico. Also, on the western periphery of the city was a
barrio with ties to West Mexico (Michoacán) and Oaxaca (Gómez 1998, 2002;
Gómez and Gazzola 2009; also Gamboa 1998).
Carballo and Garcı́a-Des Lauriers (2008; also Brambila and Crespo 2002; Darras
and Faugère 2007; David et al. 2007; Faugère 2007a, b) discuss early ties between
Teotihuacan and the Basin of Mexico and areas to the north and west.Settlement
reorganization in southern Querétaro and murals at the site of El Rosario suggest a
direct Teotihuacan presence ca. AD 400 (Moreno 2012). Filini (2004; Filini and
Cárdenas 2007) discusses trade relations between the Cuitzeo region of Michoacán
and Teotihuacan.
Carballo and Pluckhahn (2007) provide new details of Teotihuacan’s corridor
through Tlaxcala to the east and south. Sugiura (2005, also Dı́az 1998) examined
how portions of the Valley of Toluca became part of Teotihuacan’s outer
hinterlands. Healan (2012) reviews Teotihuacan’s expansion into the Tula region,
along with Zapotec enclaves, and Teotihuacan’s subsequent retraction, which
reflected its growing difficulties with hinterlands. Teotihuacan incorporated cottonproducing areas of Morelos (Hirth 2000; Smith and Montiel 2001). Although Puebla
contributed to the flow of immigrants to Teotihuacan, Teotihuacan apparently did
not control Cholula or southern Puebla where Thin Orange ceramic workshops were
located (Plunket and Uruñuela 1998; 2005; also Plunket and Blanco 1989; Rattray
1990).

Articles in Braswell’s (2003a) volume present evidence and varied viewpoints
about the nature of interactions between Teotihuacan and the Maya highlands and
lowlands. Beyond replaying old themes, I see several important developments. The
first is tighter definition of different types of influence and interactions. The second
is application of new methods, such as compositional, isotopic, and DNA studies, to
systematically assess interactions.
Maya scholars remain divided on whether Teotihuacan had a direct presence in
the Maya highlands and lowlands. Most agree, however, that Teotihuacan did not
significantly shape the long-term development of Maya kingdoms (Braswell 2003a,
b, c; Fash and Fash 2000; Marcus 2003). Most authors in Braswell’s volume
disagree with the idea that Teotihuacan had a direct presence in the Maya region.
Cowgill (2003b), however, sees the internalist–externalist dichotomy shifting in
response to new evidence. Chronological refinements are another reason for the
shifting views.
Cowgill (2003b) and Millon (1988) had been cautious about accepting evidence
of direct Teotihuacan presence beyond its immediate borders, in part because of
limited knowledge of the organization of the Teotihuacan state within its own
hinterlands. Cowgill (2003b) also cautioned that the Teotihuacan state was not
simply an early version of the Aztec empire. They doubted Santley’s (1994; Santley
and Alexander 1996; Santley and Arnold 2004, 2005; Santley et al. 1987)
interpretation of a Teotihuacan colony at Matacapan. Spence (1996b) suggested
Matacapan better fits a model of a terminal in a trade diaspora. Stoner and Pool
(2015) argue that Matacapan’s leaders employed central Mexican ideology to
bolster loyalty of local subjects.
Kaminaljuyú in highland Guatemala has been interpreted as a Teotihuacan
colony, a merchant colony, a port-of-trade, or a case of local emulation and
international elite interactions (Sanders and Michels 1977; Wright et al. 2010).
Braswell (2003c) finds data from Kaminaljuyú inconclusive. Recent isotopic studies
of tomb burials identified skeletons of local children, but decapitated skulls and
peripheral skeletons were mostly people from the Maya lowlands; two individuals
were either from or traveled to central Mexico (Wright et al. 2010; also White et al.
2000a). This evidence indicates more intensive interaction between Kaminaljuyú
and the Maya lowlands but also direct relations with central Mexico, most likely
Teotihuacan.
Stuart’s (2000) translation of texts referring to an ‘‘arrival of strangers from the
west’’ in AD 378, which coincided with the disappearance of Tikal’s king, refueled
debate about a direct Teotihuacan presence in the southern lowlands and possible
meddling in dynastic successions at Tikal and Copán. Stuart argues that the new
king, Yax Nuun Ayiin, was of Teotihuacan descent, perhaps the son of a
Teotihuacan ruler (Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 24–53). The founder, K’inich Yax
K’uk’ Mo’, of Copán’s dynasty, however, (Sharer 2001, 2003), most likely came
from Caracol in the central lowlands, although he also might have journeyed to
Teotihuacan (Buikstra et al. 2004; Chase and Chase 2011; Price et al. 2010; Stuart
2007). Many Mayanists see Teotihuacan influence as emulation by local rulers and
elites (e.g., Borowicz 2003; Iglesias Ponce de León 2003; Laporte 2001, 2003;
Wright 2005). Smith and Montiel (2001, p. 267) suggest that Maya elites adopted

123

28

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

Teotihuacan symbolism and perhaps undertook pilgrimages to the city to legitimize
new dynasties, and in some cases, they formed alliances with Teotihuacan (also
Estrada-Belli et al. 2006; Fash and Fash 2000; Fash et al. 2009).
Santley’s (1983) notions of a Teotihuacan economic empire were exaggerated.
Cowgill (2003b, pp. 315–316) is now convinced that for a brief time Teotihuacan or
people closely connected to Teotihuacan interfered with the politics of Tikal and
Copán and established a few colonial outposts (Hassig 1992; Manzanilla 2006a;
Smith and Montiel 2001). Cowgill (2003b) sees Teotihuacan–Maya interactions as
dynamic that began in first century AD, perhaps a century earlier, as mostly indirect.
Relations of relative equality became more unequal as Teotihuacan sought trading
partners, including those on the Gulf and Pacific Coasts. Cowgill detects a change in
interactions ca. AD 350 that perhaps lasted for 100 or 150 years and involved direct
interventions by Teotihuacan-related people backed by armed forces in selected
places: Matacapan on the Gulf Coast, the Cerro Bernal district and Mirador in
Chiapas, Montana/Los Chatos in coastal Guatemala and selected Maya centers,
including Tikal, Copán, Kaminaljuyú, Rı́o Azul, and perhaps elsewhere. The
Azatemo stela depicting a Teotihuacan-style warrior suggests a military presence in
Guerrero (Taube 2011, p. 104). Bove (2002; Bove and Medrano Busto 2003) sees
evidence of a Teotihuacan colony at Montana. The absence of locally made
Teotihuacan-style utilitarian pottery suggests to Cowgill (2003b) an incursion of
soldiers or perhaps merchants from Teotihuacan. He doubts that Teotihuacan had
sufficient resources to sustain an empire for very long. In fact, Teotihuacan’s
presence outside central Mexico was short-lived.
Teotihuacanos engaged in multiple kinds of interregional interactions depending
on their internal politics, their strategic interests, and the foreigners with whom they
engaged (Marcus 2003). Spence’s (1996a, 2005) model of trade diasporas offers an
alternative to state colonization that is not incompatible with direct paramilitary–
merchant presence in other areas, as Cowgill (2003b) has suggested on the Pacific
Coast (also Garcı́a-Des Lauriers 2007). Other cases involved elite and diplomatic
exchanges, pilgrimages, and trade and emulation (e.g., Marcus and Flannery 1996;
Taube 2003, 2004; Winter et al. 1998; for coastal Oaxaca see Joyce 2003). Stoner
and Pool (2015) reconceptualize the variable interactions between the Tuxtla’s and
Teotihuacan.
Over two decades ago, Stark (1990) laid out a series of alternative models of
interregional interaction and their test criteria, including imperialism with direct or
indirect administration, co-option of local elites, alliance, elite relations, patronage,
prestige competition, and market exchange. Archaeologists have made headway in
developing research designs to understand the ‘‘diverse mosaic’’ of Teotihuacan’s
interregional relations. Biogenetic and geochemical compositional analyses have
become especially important when linked with contextual studies. We should
consider this mosaic from multiple perspectives—local leaders and communities—
as well as from Teotihuacan’s viewpoint, and, as in Spence’s diasporic model, bear
in mind that interactions were not always directly or exclusively state controlled.
Intermediate elites, merchants, craft specialists, and commoner migrants also forged
interregional relationships.

Collapse
The collapse of ancient societies has garnered much public attention (e.g., Diamond
2005). Teotihuacan’s foreign interactions began to retract ca. AD 450/500, and there
is evidence of increasing political and economic problems in its outer hinterlands
and in the Basin of Mexico as well (Cowgill 1977, p. 185, 2003b, 2012; Gazzola
2009b; Hirth 2000, p. 253; Hirth and Swezey 1976, p. 150; Mastache et al. 2002,
p. 45; Millon 1988, p. 135; Pérez 2004; Sanders 2003, p. 196). The areas under
Teotihuacan’s direct control already had begun to shrink by the Metepec phase, and
the population of the city itself was declining (Cowgill 1996, p. 327, 2006; Sanders
2003, p. 193). The fiery destruction and desecration of major buildings has been
dated two centuries earlier than the older conventional date of AD 750 (BeramendiOrosco et al. 2009). Resolving the dates of the destruction directly bears on
understanding the city’s collapse.
Teotihuacan’s great size and the absence of nearby rivals during its early history
contributed to its long period of dominance. Sociopolitical relations generally have
been given more weight than environmental processes in explaining Teotihuacan’s
collapse because of the Basin of Mexico’s capacity for agricultural intensification as
seen in the Late Postclassic (Cowgill 2006). Manzanilla (2003), however, suggests
that environmental degradation from deforestation, especially if combined with
drought, made the city more vulnerable to external threats. Sanders (2003) disputed
the idea that environmental degradation posed a serious problem, arguing that the
city’s collapse and declining population that was unable to maintain landscape
modifications, such as terraces, precipitated degradation (Córdova and Parsons
1996). McClung de Tapia et al. (2003, 2005b) found evidence of increased erosion
and deforestation, but it seems most correlated with the city’s early rapid growth.
On the other hand, the fact that following Teotihuacan’s collapse, most Epiclassic
centers in the Basin were in low-lying areas,near marshes and/or floodplains
prompted Parsons (2006, pp. 73–74) to posit a possible role for ‘‘climatic change,
environmental stress, and the changing importance of aquatic resources in the
organizational collapse of Classic Teotihuacan.’’
Manzanilla (2003, see also Gazzola 2009b) also cites disruption of provisioning
networks as groups on the periphery took advantage of Teotihuacan’s weakening
power. She explored sources of tensions within Teotihuacan including the
multiethnic make up of the city and increasing challenges to Teotihuacan’s
corporate rulership by intermediary elites (Manzanilla 2007, 2015). Through
innovative statistical analyses, Robertson (2001, 2005) documented how residential
segregation increased in the city and this, too, would have heightened social
tensions.
Despite initial advantages of its hyper-nucleation, Millon (1988, pp. 219–220)
wondered if the inflexibility of Teotihuacan’s rulers to explore other strategies led to
underutilization of the rich agricultural resources of the southern Basin (Parsons
et al. 1982) and contributed to the city’s collapse. As a sign of Teotihuacan’s
difficulties, even with increased immigration, the number of Tlajinga 33’s poor
nonagricultural specialists declined. We do not know if the patterns at Tlajinga 33

123

30

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

were characteristic of other urban compounds. As the integrity of Teotihuacan as an
economic and social power was severely compromised, rival polities exploited and
profited from Teotihuacan’s demographic problems (Storey 2006, pp. 293–294; also
White et al. 2004b).
In addition to challenges from intermediate elites and tensions within the city,
Hirth (2000; Hirth and Swezey 1976, p. 150) thinks Teotihuacan’s problems began
with ‘‘regionalization’’ of its hinterlands and growing power of regional elites who
diverted resources from Teotihuacan’s market network. Support for this view comes
from Teotihuacan’s retraction from the Tula area before the city collapsed. As
another example, during the Teotihuacan period, Cerro Portezuelo imported
obsidian from Michoacan and ceramics from the Western Basin, as well as from
Teotihuacan (Healan 2012; Nichols et al. 2013). It still remains unclear if the
growth of regional centers was a cause or effect of Teotihuacan’s collapse (Cowgill
2006).
Millon (1988, p. 156) suspected people in the city burned and destroyed public
buildings. Cowgill (1997, pp. 156–157) and López Luján et al. (2006, p. 32) favor
neighboring polities possibly allied with Teotihuacan dissidents: those who
destroyed Teotihuacan politically annihilated the rulers of the metropolis and
ritually terminated all sources of supernatural power. They think people who lived
at Teotihuacan would not have engaged in such destruction. Further understanding
of Teotihuacan’s collapse will require research projects focused at both Teotihuacan
and hinterland settlements.

Epiclassic and Postclassic Teotihuacan
Teotihuacan’s legacy persisted throughout the Postclassic, long after the destruction
of its public buildings and state symbols and the loss of population. This collapse
reshaped the landscape of central Mexico. Interest in cyclic or episodic aspects of
state formation, fragmentation, collapse, and regeneration has risen in recent years
(e.g., Charlton and Nichols 1997; Marcus 1998; Schwartz 2006; Yoffee 2005).
Archaeologists have turned more attention to the Epiclassic in central Mexico,
important for understanding both the collapse of the Teotihuacan state and the
development of Postclassic city-states (Faugère 2007a; Manzanilla 2005c; Solar
2006a, b, c).
Epiclassic (AD 600/650–900)
Soon after buildings on the Street of the Dead were sacked and burned, the city’s
population dropped dramatically (Cowgill 1996). Rattray (2001, p. 435) suggests
the city was briefly abandoned. The retracting Teotihuacan state system fragmented,
and new polities were founded, which established the city-state as the dominant
political form of the Postclassic (Charlton and Nichols 1997, pp. 190–194; Cowgill
1996, p. 329; Diehl 1989, p. 16; Garcı́a 2004; Parsons 2006; Rattray 1996; Sanders
et al. 1979, pp. 129–131). Exchange relations and production systems were
restructured; the Pachuca obsidian source once dominated by Teotihuacan saw only

123

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

31

limited use during the Epiclassic (Carballo 2011a; Healan 1997; Pastrana 1998,
pp. 240–254; Spence and Parsons 1972). Production of bifaces of Otumba obsidian
continued in workshops at Teotihuacan, with some exports going to other Epiclassic
settlements in the Basin of Mexico (Charlton and Spence 1983, pp. 64–65; Garcı́a
1991, pp. 385–388; Nelson 2000, 2009; Rattray 1981, 1987, 1996). Construction of
Teotihuacan-style apartment compounds ended. Blanton et al. (1996) see a shift
from corporate to network strategies of political economy following Teotihuacan’s
collapse; there was a rejection of the ideology of the centralized regional state
(Crider 2011). However, we know little about the form or structure of governance of
Epiclassic polities in the Basin of Mexico.
Epiclassic, Coyotlatelco pottery at Teotihuacan is widely distributed, (Crider
et al. 2007, p. 126; Gamboa 1999; Gómez and Cabrera 2006; Manzanilla 2005b;
Manzanilla et al. 1996; Moragas 1998, 1999; Ortega 2005). We do not have an
adequate understanding of this phase of Teotihuacan’s history. Some Early Classic
buildings were reused, including around and on the Sun Pyramid platform; squatters
occupied some apartment compounds, while others resided in small, dispersed
houses and caves behind the Sun Pyramid (Gómez and Cabrera 2006, pp. 222–233;
Manzanilla and Arrellı́n 1999). Some individuals buried in the caves were foreign
born and others lived their entire lives at Teotihuacan (Manzanilla et al. 1996).
Manzanilla (2005b, p. 263) suggested that northern migrants using Coyotlatelco
Red-on-natural pottery began moving to Teotihuacan in Late Xolalpan times.
Beekman and Christiansen (2003, pp. 144–145) also postulated that Coyotlatelcousing groups settled in the Basin of Mexico before Teotihuacan’s collapse, as they
did at Tula (Healan 2012; Hernández and Healan 2012). Archaeologists have done
substantial research during the last decade on the painted Coyotlatelco decorative
pottery style that first developed northwest of the Basin of Mexico (Beekman 2010a;
Bonfil 2005; Brambila and Crespo 2005; Braniff 2005; Crider et al. 2007,
pp. 127–129; Garcı́a et al. 2006; Jiménez Betts 2007; López and Nicolás 2005;
Manzanilla 2005b; Mastache and Cobean 1989; Migeon and Perreira 2007;
Montoya 2008; Nelson and Crider 2005; Paredes 2005; Rattray 1998a, b, c). El
Bajı́o is often cited as the source area; Hernández and Healan (2012) marshal clear
evidence pointing in particular to the eastern bajı́o that had long-standing
interactions with the Basin of Mexico (Beekman and Christensen 2003, 2011;
Cowgill 2008a; Fournier 2006; Fournier and Bolaños 2007, pp. 504–505; Fournier
et al. 2006).
Sugiura (2006) and Fournier and Bolaños (2007, pp. 510–511) conclude that the
Basin of Mexico and Toluca were the core areas for the Coyotlatelco ceramic
complex that incorporated both foreign and local elements. Sugiura points out if
archaeologists focus only on the red-on-natural decorated pottery, then Coyotlatelco
ceramics appear to be new and intrusive (see also Crider 2011). The hybridity view
has gained traction, but not everyone agrees (Cowgill 2013).
The collapse of Teotihuacan prompted population shifts, but there is much debate
about the scale of population movements and migration as a cause versus effect of
Epiclassic culture change. Regional settlement data show a pattern of population
dispersal from Teotihuacan leading to growth of some existing settlements and
founding of new ones (Blanton et al. 1993, pp. 135–138; Charlton and Nichols

123

32

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

1997, pp. 190–194; Diehl 1989, p. 16; Gorenflo 2006; Parsons 2006; Sanders 2006;
Sanders et al. 1979, pp. 129–137). In contrast, Cowgill (2013) and others (e.g.,
Beekman and Christensen 2003, pp. 144–145, 2011; Rattray 1996) argue that
significant migration and ethnic replacement took place in the Epiclassic. Others
take a more middle-ground position of migrants mixing with local populations (e.g.,
López and Nicolás 2005; Manzanilla (2005b). Hernández and Healan (2012)
suggest small groups moved into the Basin from the north and west, perhaps
including the northern Toluca Valley and Tula region, and coexisted with local
populations. Beekman and Christensen (2011, p. 160) point out that the changes in
material culture were not simply because local residents moved out of places such
as the southern Mezquital (southern Hidalgo and Querétaro) but because of the
collapse of ‘‘the symbolic capital of the visual corpus’’ of the Teotihuacan state and
a desire to express a social identity not associated with a failed state. Biogenetic
studies indicate significant population movement between the Classic and
Postclassic, perhaps even more than with the rise of Aztec city-states (GonzálezJosé et al. 2002). Increasing aridity is one factor behind migration from the Bajı́o
(Beekman and Christensen 2011).
The degree of cultural continuity, or lack thereof, between Early Classic
Teotihuacan and the Epiclassic is integral to this debate. The existence of a
transitional ceramic phase in the Basin of Mexico has been debated for decades
(Crider 2011, 2013; Crider et al. 2007; Garcı́a 2004; Manzanilla and López 1998;
Parsons and Sugiura 2012; Rattray 2001; Sanders 2006; Sugiura 2006). Sanders
(1986, 2006, p. 185) even questioned the status of Metepec that Rattray (2001)
defined as the final Teotihuacan phase. He proposed that an Early Epiclassic
transitional phase, Oxtotipac, was the final phase of the city as a large population
center. Recent comparative studies of Epiclassic and Early Postclassic pottery from
central Mexico have advanced the ceramic phasing (Crider 2011, 2013; Fournier
and Bolaños 2007; Fournier et al. 2006; Garcı́a et al. 2006; Gaxiola 2006; Sugiura
2005). Crider (2011, pp. 166–170) convincingly differentiates an Early Epiclassic
phase that precedes the appearance of Coyotlatelco decorated pottery. A distinctive
Southern Basin Early Epiclassic pottery complex may partially overlap Metepec
(see also Garcı́a et al. 2006; Gaxiola 2006). If this transitional pottery complex were
associated with migrants moving into caves behind the Sun Pyramid and at
Oxtotipac, as Crider suggests, that would explain why such ceramics are not present
everywhere at Teotihuacan. The Early Epiclassic pottery complex also signals a
marked decline in ceramic exchange between subregions of the Basin of Mexico
(Crider 2011, 2013; Nichols et al. 2013).
Despite Cowgill’s (1996) downward population estimate, Teotihuacan still seems
to have been among, if not the, largest Epiclassic settlement cluster in the Basin.
Cyphers (2000) and Sanders (2006) interpret the distribution of the Coyotlatelco
decorated pottery as evidence of Teotihuacan’s continuing but reduced influenced in
the Epiclassic. Other archaeologists doubt it was still so influential (Blanton et al.
1993, pp. 137–138).
The Epiclassic settlement clusters representing small polities or city-states can be
differentiated from each other by unoccupied spaces between them and by local
ceramic variation documented in the last decade (Crider 2011, 2013; Fournier and

123

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

33

Bolaños 2007; Garcı́a 2004, pp. 351–354; Gaxiola 2006; López and Nicolás 2005;
López et al. 2006; Parsons and Sugiura 2012; Sterpone 2004; Rattray 2006; Sugiura
2006; see also Cobean 1990, pp. 174–177). Interaction was most intense among
adjoining settlement clusters in the Basin, a pattern consistent with Hirth’s (2000,
p. 247) argument that city-state confederations, which became so important in
Postclassic politics, initially developed during the Epiclassic, perhaps for selfdefense in the fragmented and volatile environment of Teotihuacan’s collapse
(Garcı́a 2004, p. 353; Nichols et al. 2006, 2013; Parsons 2006; Plunket and
Uruñuela 2005; Rattray 2006).
The weakening of state power after the Classic period is widely viewed as a
catalyst for increased market exchange and commercialization during the Postclassic. With results from Crider’s (2011) research and the recent Cerro Portezuelo
project (Crider 2013; Nichols et al. 2013), there now is substantial neutron
activation analysis (NAA) data for the Epiclassic. Despite the widespread
Coyotlatelco decorated style, there was very limited exchange of pottery between
subregions of the Basin of Mexico during the Epiclassic (Crider 2013; Crider et al.
2007; Nichols et al. 2002, 2013). Pottery was made at Teotihuacan, and minor
amounts were exported, but nothing on the scale of Early Classic ceramic
production (Gómez and Cabrera 2006; Rattray 2006). The composition data are
consistent with solar markets; the movement of pottery between settlement clusters
and subregions of the Basin was the lowest of any time during the Classic or
Postclassic. A retraction in ceramic exchange followed the collapse of Teotihuacan
as potters left the city, also perhaps because of competition and hostilities between
Epiclassic polities. At the same time, obsidian imports from Michoacán increased.
Postclassic
During the Early Postclassic (AD 900–1150), the Teotihuacan Valley comprised a
single state centered at Teotihuacan (Sanders 1986, p. 525). Cowgill (1996)
estimates its Early Postclassic population at 30,000, although it might have been
lower (ca. 20,000). Sanders (1986) divided the Early Postclassic in the Teotihuacan
Valley into two subphases, with the distinctive Mazapan/Mazapa wavy-line red-onnatural pottery diagnostic of the first subphase. López and Nicolás (2005, p. 285;
López 2009) place its origins in the Teotihuacan Valley, but incorporating
influences from the Bajı́o (Manzanilla 2005b). Crider (2011) identified a variant of
Mazapan Wavy-line that was made at Teotihuacan. Sanders recognized a second,
Atlatongo subphase characterized by local imitations of Tula decorated pottery that
marked the incorporation of the Teotihuacan Valley into Tula’s sphere. Smith and
Montiel (2001) questioned the idea of Toltec imperialism and even its regional
influence in the Basin of Mexico, but this was prior to Crider’s (2011, 2013) study
of Early Postclassic ceramics and compositional analyses (Crider et al. 2007,
Nichols et al. 2013).
Although Aztec claims of Toltec grandeur were exaggerated, Tula’s interactions
with Teotihuacan were significant during the Early Postclassic (Crider 2011;
Nichols 2013b). Teotihuacan was a historically important and venerable place to
Tula. Mastache et al. (2009) characterize Tula’s evocation of Teotihuacan, as ‘‘neo-

123

34

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

Teotihuacanism.’’ Crider (2011) has greatly clarified Early Postclassic pottery
complexes at Teotihuacan and worked out the concordance with Tula. There are,
however, important regional differences in the early phase, Mazapan complex; for
example, sloppy red/natural pottery is distinctive to Teotihuacan and the
northeastern Basin where it was produced. Mazapan wavy-line is now known to
have a wider distribution, but Crider has linked local variants to different
composition groups, one of which was centered at Teotihuacan (Bey 1986, p. 210;
Crider 2011, pp. 291–300, 2013).
There are clear affinities between the Mazapan and Atlatongo–Tollan pottery
complexes at Teotihuacan and Tula ceramics, including imports from the Tula
region. With Tula’s expansion, the Pachuca obsidian source was again intensively
mined and exported to the Teotihuacan Valley (Domı́nguez and Pastrana 2006). A
dramatic decrease in Late Tollan cream slip pottery at Teotihuacan and other sites
suggests that Tula’s influence and control beyond the northwest corner of the Basin
waned before the end of the Early Postclassic (Crider 2011, p. 399). Despite an
increase in commerce, strong political/ethnic barriers or other differences restricted
exchanges of ceramics between sites with Aztec I pottery and sites such as
Teotihuacan with Mazapan–Tollan ceramics (Garcı́a 2004, fig. 3.2, also Brumfiel
2005; Brumfiel and Hodge 1996; Crider 2011; Crider et al. 2007; Nichols et al.
2002, 2013; Parsons et al. 1996; Parsons and Gorenflo in press).
We do not know much about the organization of Teotihuacan in the Early
Postclassic. People continued to live in caves behind the Sun Pyramid, including
both local and foreign-born individuals (Manzanilla et al. 1996; Nicolás 2003).
Cowgill (1996, p. 330) estimates an Early Postclassic population of 30,000 people in
the area encompassed by the Teotihuacan Mapping Project. Sanders and Murdy
(1987) think the population was smaller, 5,000 to 10,000, about the size of the Late
Postclassic Aztec town. The largest area of settlement is Las Palmas, east of the Sun
Pyramid (Elson and Mowbray 2005; Linné 2003b).
Aztec Teotihuacan: Altepetl and Town
As Tula’s influence retracted, the Middle Postclassic was a time of political
fragmentation in the Basin; some Aztec city-states can be traced back to AD
1150–1250. The Early Postclassic state centered at Teotihuacan broke into small
city-states (Nichols 2013b). The Teotihuacan Mapping Project surveyed the area of
Late Postclassic Teotihuacan (Evans and Sanders 2000; Sanders and Evans 2000,
2001a), although Sanders’ crews only examined the center of the town (La Villa)
and two of its attached barrios (Evans et al. 2000, p. 236). Modern and colonial
occupation, along with the dense remains of the Early Classic city, obscures the
Aztec town (Ortega 2005). The 20-km2 area of Early Classic Teotihuacan includes
an extensive Aztec occupation comparable to the modern and early colonial
settlements (Evans et al. 2000, p. 235).
By the Middle Postclassic (AD 1150–1350), Teotihuacan was the capital of a
small city-state with its own ruler. Azcapotzalco briefly interrupted Teotihuacan’s
royal line when it conquered the town in 1420, but the famous Acolhua ruler,
Nezahuacoyotl, reestablished the royal line in 1428, and through intermarriage

123

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

35

Teotihuacan’s ruling dynasty became linked with Texcoco (Ixtlixóchitl 1985; also
Sanders and Evans 2001b, p. 906). Evans et al. (2000, p. 253) estimate the Late
Postclassic town had a population of at least 7,000–8,000 to 12,000–15,000 people.
In addition to being an administrative and religious center, Teotihuacan held a
weekly market and both obsidian and ceramics were produced in the town (Spence
1985). It lay at the head of a permanent irrigation system extending from the springs
at Teotihuacan to the shore of Lake Texcoco, watering about 5,800 ha in 1519
(Sanders 1976; Sanders et al. 1979).
Garraty (1998, 2000, 2006a, b) studied Aztec ceramics from Teotihuacan and
found a continuous distribution of household wealth, with elites distributed over all
parts of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project survey area that includes a possible Aztec
palace. He initially interpreted this as supporting Lockhart’s (1992) modular model
of altepetl organization. It would be useful to combine Sanders’ survey data and the
Teotihuacan Mapping Project data for a fuller test of the model (Garraty 2000,
p. 336). Based on his analysis, Garraty (2006a, p. 373) thinks the urban center
during the Middle Postclassic was located southeast of the Ciudadela and that
Teotihuacan’s shifting political affiliations prompted moving the town center to its
present location. Teotihuacan paid tribute to both Texcoco and Tenochtitlan (Nutall
1926, p. 68).
Building on Hodge et al. (1992, 1993; Minc et al. 1994), recent stylistic and
composition studies of Aztec ceramics provide valuable new data on production,
distribution, and the Aztec political economy of the Teotihuacan Valley (e.g.,
Charlton et al. 2007; Garraty 2006b; Neff and Glascock 2000; Neff et al. 2000;
Nichols 2013a, b; Nichols et al. 2002, 2009, 2013; Nichols and Charlton 2002;
Plunket et al. 2005; Rodrı́guez et al. 2009). Garraty (2006b) found that most Aztec
plain ware pottery at Teotihuacan was made in the local composition group, with
some imports from the Texcoco region and minor amounts from the southeast
Basin, consistent with a pattern of overlapping markets. By the Late Postclassic (AD
1350–1521), Teotihuacan had become incorporated into a northern Acolhua
exchange sphere in which it was one of two head administrative centers in the
Teotihuacan Valley; the other was nearby Otumba (Carrasco 1999, pp. 265–266;
Charlton et al. 2000; Garraty 2006b, p. 177; Minc 2006; Nichols and Charlton
1996). The Late Postclassic saw increasing imports of Aztec III Black-on-orange
pottery, especially from the Tenochtitlan composition group to the Teotihuacan
Valley, a shift linked to the development of a hierarchical regional market network
and Aztec imperialism. Canoes transported goods across Lake Texcoco to
Chiconautla at the mouth of the Teotihuacan Valley; from there they were carried
inland to Teotihuacan and other market centers (Hassig 1985; Nichols et al. 2009).
Teotihuacan also lay on an important trade route to the Gulf Coast. Obsidian coreblade workshops were dispersed at Teotihuacan and associated with both elite and
commoner residences (Spence 1985). A workshop near the Late Postclassic town
center had the highest ranking of elite pottery in Garraty’s (2006b) study, and he
suggests it might have been associated with merchants.
Otumba surpassed Teotihuacan as the largest altepetl in area in the Teotihuacan
Valley during the Late Postclassic, and its capital town became an important
manufacturing center with a resident enclave of pochteca (long-distance merchants)

123

36

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

(Nichols 2013a). Blanton (1996) argues that Texcoco encouraged Otumba’s growth
because Teotihuacan’s great historical legacy made it a potential rival. Also, by the
Late Postclassic, the Otumba obsidian source no longer was in Teotihuacan’s
domain.
Late Postclassic Teotihuacan was not exceptional in size or organization but
remained a very important religious and historical center (Boone 2000). Maps from
the sixteenth century record the location of Teotihuacan’s great pyramids and refer
to them as the oracle of Moctezuma (Webmoor 2007). The Aztec ruler Moctezuma
is claimed to have made a pilgrimage every 20 days to the oracle, the Mexica god of
war, Huitzilopochtili (Boone 2000, pp. 386–387; Kubler 1982, p. 45; Nuttall 1926,
p. 68). The Mazapan Map labels the Ciudadela ‘‘place of burials in honor of the
sun’’ (Boone 2000, p. 373).
Teotihuacan held special importance as an ancient place of history. Carrasco
et al. (2000a) devoted a volume to Teotihuacan’s Postclassic legacy as the first
Tollan (Boone 2000; López Austin and López Luján 2000; Nichols 2013b). It was
the place of creation for the Fifth Sun and, according to Taube (2000a), represents
the ‘‘creed’’ that supporting the sun required the active participation of people,
especially warriors. In their migration account, the Mexica associate themselves
with the Toltecs of Culhuacan and thus acquired a prestigious ancestry linked to
Teotihuacan (Heyden 2000). Mexicas copied Teotihuacan sculpture and architecture, concepts of urban planning, and excavated at Teotihuacan for antiquities they
incorporated as offerings at the Templo Mayor (Carrasco et al. 2000a; also Fash
et al. 2009; Umberger 1996, pp. 89–90). People at the Postclassic Otomı́ capital of
Xaltocan, in the northwestern Basin of Mexico, collected and curated Early Classic
figurines from Teotihuacan, as did people at Postclassic Teotihuacan (Brumfiel
2005; Manzanilla et al. 1996; Overholtzer and Stoner 2011). Although a rejection of
Teotihuacan state symbols followed the destruction of the Early Classic city, later
peoples, from commoners to rulers, sought historical connections with Teotihuacan
giving rise to antiquarianism. Teotihuacan played a key role in the historical
validation of Mexica imperialism and other Postclassic states (Boone 2000; Nichols
2013b; Umberger 1987, 1996). As Orozco vividly depicted in his famous mural,
Teotihuacan’s pyramids continue to link the past, archaeology, and nation building
(Fash 2013).
Nicholson (2000) and Sugiyama (2000) trace the origins of the Aztec feathered
serpent to Teotihuacan; ‘‘it offers one of the most notable examples of the Aztec
ability to synthesize and express the complex iconographic and ideological
traditions it inherited from earlier civilizations’’ (Nicholson 2000, p. 160).
Teotihuacan’s feathered serpent image is a widely recognized symbol of modern
Mexico.
Teotihuacan and New Spain
Charlton (2007) helped launch modern historical archaeology in central Mexico
with his research in the Teotihuacan Valley. Sanders et al. (2001, pp. 906–917)
provide a recent summary of the political geography of the cacicazgo of
Teotihuacan during the colonial period. The Mazapan maps made by native map

123

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

makers document changes and continuities at Teotihuacan during the 16th
century—depicting the pyramid ruins, a nopal cactus field, a possible ballcourt,
Catholic churches and shrines, Spaniards, and Nahuas (Kubler 1982, pp. 50–51).
Münch (1976) traced a three-century history of the Teotihuacan royal family after
the conquest. Drawing on Munch’s work, Sanders and Price (2003; Sanders et al.
2001) discuss how the descendants of Teotihuacan’s prehispanic rulers expanded
their landholdings after the Spanish conquest and retained palace estates and private
holdings into the 1820s. They continued the Aztec practice of marrying politically
powerful families. Also important was their proximity to markets and Mexico City,
the production of such cash crops as wheat, maguey, and barley, and later their shift
to renting lands to Spaniards (Sanders et al. 2001, p. 917). During the mid-1800s,
family members divided the landholdings, and by 1917, the descendants of
Teotihuacan’s royal line were peasants who owned little or no land (Gamio 1922).
Sanders et al. (2001, p. 917) discussion of the cacicazgo of Teotihuacan closes
with observations about the intense competition for Indian lands and labor among
Indian elites, the Spanish crown, the Catholic Church, and Spanish entrepreneurs
that lasted for three centuries. The first to lose was the Indian aristocracy, followed
by the Spanish state after the War of Independence, and the church a few decades
later. Criollo entrepreneurs held their position until the Agrarian Revolution in the
twentieth century. Because the Teotihuacan Valley retained more of its rural
landscape than other parts of the Basin of Mexico in the mid-twentieth century,
Teotihuacan’s extensive remains were accessible to modern archaeology.

Not the Final Word
Teotihuacan was a place of historical importance to the Aztecs, and its legacy
continues to shape conceptualizations and expressions of history. Yet scholars
strongly disagree about what languages were spoken at Early Classic Teotihuacan.
Not everyone agrees that Teotihuacan even possessed a writing system (Colas 2011,
pp. 13–15). I find it difficult to think that a city the size of Teotihuacan with its
complex regional and foreign interactions, including with other contemporary
literate civilizations, never developed a writing system. Cabrera (2000) argues that
glyphs found on the patio floor of an apartment compound in the La Ventilla barrio
were part of a writing system ancestral to Postclassic central Mexican codices. For
Taube (2000b, 2001), Teotihuacan was the canonical source of Postclassic Nahuatl
culture (see also Browder 2005). Glyphs include dates in the 260-day calendar,
toponyms, and what Taube (2011) calls emblematic glyphs that may represent titles
and personal names. He argues that writing developed during the period of
Teotihuacan’s explosive growth.
Cowgill (1992, 1999) argues that glyphic correspondences do not necessarily
mean that a Nahua language was spoken at Teotihuacan before the Epiclassic.
Florescano (2006a, p. 15), a historian, thinks that Teotihuacanos spoke an ancient
Nahua language. Hill (2001, 2010, 2011a, b), a linguist influenced by Bellwood
(2001), proposes that the spread of proto-Uto Azteca speakers took place early as
part of a northward expansion of farming groups from central Mexico. She cites

123

38

J Archaeol Res (2016) 24:1–74

Dakin and Wichmann’s (2000) interpretation of the word for cacao (chocolate) used
in Classic Maya inscriptions as borrowed, likely from Teotihuacan. Kaufman and
Justeson (2007), however, dispute their interpretation and instead argue that
Teotihuacan elites spoke a language from the Mixe-Zoquean family. If correct, then
Cowgill (2013) places the movement of Nahuatl speakers into Teotihuacan shortly
before it’s collapse AD 550–650. A consensus on this question has not been
reached. ‘‘Totonakan, Nawan, and a now extinct form of Mixe-Zoquean seem likely
candidates for languages originally spoken at Teotihuacan… the Early Classic texts
at Teotihuacan recorded one or several languages’’ (Nielsen and Helmke 2011,
p. 348; see also Beekman 2010b). Nielsen and Helmke argue that glyphs on the floor
of the Plaza de los Glifos in the La Ventilla barrio are not toponyms but are related
to curing rituals and disease-causing agents. The final word has yet to be written on
Teotihuacan’s languages and writing system.

Concluding Thoughts
Teotihuacan continues to have great importance. The archaeological zone attracts
4 million visitors each year, and UNESCO designated Teotihuacan a World
Heritage Site (Kruetzer 2006; Manzanilla 2006b; Webmoor 2005). The richness of
Teotihuacan studies stems from the importance of the ancient city and state, its
legacy, and broad comparative and innovative scholarship. Current research at
Teotihuacan crosses disciplines from physics to art history. Today, archaeology
contains diverse theoretical perspectives with strands of both modernism and
postmodernism, processual, ‘‘processual-plus’’ (Hegmon 2003), and post-processual
archaeology and culture history, all reflected in research on Teotihuacan. Such
theoretical pragmatism and pluralism is necessary to explain such complex social
phenomena (Gándara 2012). There is a risk, however, especially in the face of a
proliferation of journals and edited volumes, that each approach only engages its
own terms of reference and not opposing viewpoints. As intense as some debates
about Teotihuacan became in the late twentieth century, they also prompted much
research.
Following broader trends in social theory, agency and practice have become
central conceptual frameworks, opening the door to approaches with a subjectcentered and system-centered focus (Nichols and Pool 2012). Blanton and Fargher
(2008) and Carballo et al. (2014b) have drawn attention to the explanatory potential
of collective action theory for Teotihuacan. Much exciting recent work at
Teotihuacan engages the intersection of the natural and social sciences (e.g., Smith
et al. 2012), while interests in ideology, ritual authority, cognitive archaeology, and
materiality track across the boundary of the social sciences and more humanistic
and interpretive approaches (Pasztory 2005). Social forces also shape Teotihuacan
archaeology and scholarship (Kelly 2011; Webmoor 2005). Crosscutting different
theoretical perspectives continues to be a strong commitment to empirical research;
perhaps the sheer size of the ancient city grounds its modern scholars.
Research on Teotihuacan has contributed to the development of new methods for
studying ancient urbanism, including statistical analyses of neighborhoods, residue

studies of floors, use of energetics to study bureaucracy, isotopic and aDNA
analyses, and deploying robots, drones, and magnetometers (e.g., Barba 2005; Feder
2004; INAH 2014; McClung de Tapia and Barba 2011; Murakami 2015; Pecci et al.
2012; Price et al. 2008; Robertson 2001). The findings question widely held
assumptions about early cities and deep human history. This large, complex,
multiethnic city was built and managed using human labor and stone tools, which
flies in the face of ‘‘stone age’’ stereotypes (Smith et al. 2012).
The greatest challenge to further advance understanding Teotihuacan is the rapid
pace of development in central Mexico without commensurate increases in
resources for archaeology; this is a problem worldwide. The controversy over
building a Wal-Mart store in San Juan Teotihuacán highlights the difficult
challenges of cultural heritage preservation and management in the face of rapid
growth (McKinley 2004; New York Times 2012). Little did anyone in the midtwentieth century anticipate the rate of site destruction in the Basin of Mexico
during the last half-century.
Teotihuacan cannot be understood in isolation, and it exemplifies the value of
multiscalar studies making research in its hinterlands important (Smith et al. 2012).
Wider application of new remote-sensing methods will aid in detection and mapping
subsurface remains both in the city and its hinterlands. Chronology is still very
important and should include investigations on the Formative period and the city’s
early history and the Epiclassic and Early Postclassic (Brambila and Cabrera
1998b). Household archaeology will continue to be a priority to capture the
heterogeneity of Teotihuacan society and contribute to comparative studies
(Carballo 2011b). Older collections will become even more valuable, increasing
the challenges for long-term storage. Electronic databases and publishing will
transform the dissemination of research about Teotihuacan and almost certainly
facilitate new research methods and directions.
