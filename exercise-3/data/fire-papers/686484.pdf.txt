Early Evidence for Brilliant Ritualized Display:
Specularite Use in the Northern Cape (South
Africa) between ~500 and ~300 Ka
by Ian Watts, Michael Chazan, and Jayne Wilkins
CA1 Online-Only Material: Supplemental Figures

Earth pigments ﬁgure prominently in debates about signal evolution among later Homo. Most archaeologists consider
such behavior to postdate ~300 Ka. To evaluate claims for Fauresmith and Acheulean pigments in South Africa’s
Northern Cape Province, extending back 1.1 Ma (Beaumont and Bednarik 2013), we reexamined collections from Kathu
Pan 1, Wonderwerk Cave, and Canteen Kopje. We report and describe materials where we are conﬁdent as to a pigment status. We found (i) compelling evidence of absence in all but the youngest Acheulean contexts, (ii) deﬁnite but
irregular use in Fauresmith contexts from at least 500 Ka, (iii) widespread and regular use within this limited area by
~300 Ka, coeval with circumstantial evidence for pigment transport over considerable distances and use in ﬁre-lit environments. These ﬁndings are used to evaluate predictions derived from two competing hypotheses addressing the
evolution of group ritual, the “female cosmetic coalitions” hypothesis (Power 2009) and the “cheap-but-honest signals”
hypothesis (Kuhn 2014), ﬁnding that the former accounts for a greater range of the observations. The ﬁndings underscore the wider behavioral signiﬁcance of the Fauresmith as an industry transitional between the Acheulean and the
Middle Stone Age.

Classical social anthropology and evolutionary ecology converge around the proposition that group ritual, with its formal characteristics of ampliﬁed, stereotypical, redundant display, established symbolic culture (Bulbulia and Sosis 2011;
Durkheim 1912; Rappaport 1999). This convergence arises from
evolutionary ecologists’ application of signal evolution theory
(see Maynard-Smith and Harper 2003)—particularly Zahavi’s
“handicap principle” (Zahavi and Zahavi 1997)—to demonstrate group ritual’s adaptive value in securing cooperation between nonkin while deterring cheats (Sosis and Alcorta 2003).
Internally, participants provide reliable signals of commitment,
and the performance helps align emotional states and a focus
for joint attention. Externally, it provides out-group observers
with a reliable index of alliance quality.1 These functions are
considered essential to creating the community-wide trust necessary for cheaper signals (e.g., language) to become evolutionarily stable (Knight 1998, 2014). Ritual’s formal characteristics
provide archaeologists with grounds for thinking that, if duIan Watts is an independent researcher (ochrewatts@hotmail.com).

rable signaling media were used, ritual should leave a clear archaeological signature (Watts 2009).
Building on these insights requires models that generate
interesting, refutable predictions as to the timing, form, and
function of early group ritual. To this end, we present data from
interior southern Africa signiﬁcantly extending the previously
assumed antiquity of earth pigment use. Addressing the timing, form, and function of early pigment traditions, we evaluate two explanatory hypotheses, both focused on group ritual
and premised in signal evolution theory (Knight, Power, and
Watts 1995; Kuhn 2014).
For scientists concerned with brute facts of nature, “symbolic culture” is enigmatic, literal falsehood being part of what
social anthropologists mean by the term “symbol” (Sperber
1975), subjective ﬁctions collectively accorded the status of objective facts (Knight 2014). As paleolithic archaeologist Phillip
Chase observed, symbolic culture required “the invention of a
whole new kind of things, things that have no existence in the
‘real’ world but exist entirely in the symbolic realm” (1994:628).
On the basis of geometric engravings, beads, and elaborated
burials (all directly or indirectly associated with red ochre),
archaeologists are generally prepared to infer symbolic culture for our species from around 100 Ka (d’Errico and Stringer

2011). Before this, earth pigments are the only recurrent archaeological evidence directly bearing on the evolution of signaling in the Homo lineage (Kuhn 2014; Watts 2014). Watts
(2014) has argued that symbolic culture can be pushed back
to our “speciation,” on the grounds that, in southern Africa,
red ochre is found in virtually every rockshelter assemblage
(sites primarily used as home bases) from ~170 Ka onwards.
He considers this “a proxy for habitual collective ritual, transcending here-and-now contexts, with ritual performers across
vast landscapes participating in shared ﬁctions” (Watts 2014:
225). Earlier pigment occurrences would, however, still require
explanation.
The prevailing view has long been that pigments can only
reliably be inferred from ~300 Ka (d’Errico 2008; Kuhn 2014;
Sagona 1994; Schmandt-Besserat 1980). Interpretation of early
pigments has largely been a theoretically unconstrained ﬁeld
of speculation with little concern for generating refutable predictions (Watts 2015). However, with twenty years separating
them, there are now two competing evolutionary hypotheses
in play, sharing much common ground: the female cosmetic
coalitions (FCC) hypothesis (Knight, Power, and Watts 1995;
Power 2009, 2010, 2014; Power, Sommer, and Watts 2013) and
Steven Kuhn’s “cheap-but-honest” signaling hypothesis (2014).
The time-consuming and extravagant nature of human collective ritual is generally considered a costly form of signaling (Sosis and Alcorta 2003). According to Zahavi, costly signals arise in contexts of strategic conﬂicts of interest between
signalers and observers, where observers have selected a trait
relevant to an underlying ﬁtness quality (implying a causal or
indexical connection between the form and meaning of the
signal); signalers of different quality bear different levels of
strategic cost, allowing observers to evaluate performance. Related debates in signal evolution theory concern manipulation
and mind reading (Krebs and Dawkins 1984) and effects of
shared versus conﬂicting interest in outcomes (Maynard Smith
and Harper 2003). For example, where signaler and receiver
share an overriding common interest in coordinating activity
but there is low-level immediate conﬂict over the next move,
low-cost, inconspicuous signals may evolve (Silk, Kaldor, and
Boyd 2000).
The hypotheses considered differ in scope and purpose, but
they agree that costly signaling can account for spectacular
ritual displays in later prehistory (where symbolic culture is
assumed), and both attach evolutionary signiﬁcance to the establishment of a home base. In Europe and the Near East, this
occurs between ~400 and ~300 Ka (Chazan 2009; Roebroeks
and Villa 2011; Shimelmitz et al. 2014; Stiner, Gopher, and
Barkai 2011). Although the strongest evidence concerns ﬁre
domestication, in both regions this associates with another fundamental technological change, where blades and/or points
appear alongside—and eventually replace—bifaces (Shimelmitz,
Barkai, and Gopher 2011; White, Ashton, and Scott 2011).
African data are not as resolved, but a similar technological
change is documented slightly earlier, from ~550 Ka (Johnson
and McBrearty 2012; Wilkins and Chazan 2012), suggesting

Volume 57, Number 3, June 2016

that African home bases may be of similar antiquity. The hypotheses fundamentally differ over early ritual: the FCC hypothesis holds that here, too, conﬂicts of interest are analytically paramount (see ﬁg. 12.1 in Knight 1999), whereas Kuhn
emphasizes shared interest.

FCC Hypothesis
In the context of the Middle Pleistocene (780–130 Ka), with
brain size increase and concomitant stress on maternal energy budgets, this hypothesis posits that coalitions of evolving females secured unprecedented levels of male investment
and reduced their own travel costs by manipulating cues of
impending fertility (i.e., menstruation). Pregnant or lactating
females acted to prevent any male targeting a menstruant at
other females’ expense by joining with her in scrambling and
amplifying the signal with blood substitutes. The menstruant
provided a reliable signal of commitment to the coalition, while
all coalition members advertised coalition quality through cosmetic display in a “song and dance” performance. The idea is
that humans came under sexual selection to show off their
allies, with cosmetics the fundamental medium. The psychological ﬁnding that individuals appear more attractive when
seen in a group (Walker and Vul 2013) suggests that, in this
hypothesized context, individual and group levels of selection
could pull in the same direction. Initially, ritual displays were
reliably indexical of menstruation, organized on an ad hoc
basis, using whatever materials came to hand, serving primarily to counter the would-be reproductive dominance of philanderers in favor of investors (for “counter dominance,” see
Erdal and Whiten 1994). With further brain size increase,
coalitions sought more regular and reliable investment, driving
a regular routine of ritual performance—irrespective of actual fertility states. Sexual access was made conditional on males
returning to a home base, surrendering the product of a collective hunt as “bride-service.” Investor males should choose
females in cosmetically decorated coalitions, since they demonstrate rejection of philanderers (reducing male reproductive variance) and reliably advertise the support available to
offspring born into that coalition. A runaway sexual selection
process is posited for this ﬁnal period of brain size increase
and our speciation. Reproductive counter dominance becomes
“reverse dominance” (Boehm 1999) as displays that were already—at different levels—both deceptive and honest (Power
2010) are no longer embedded in perceptible reality but—by
their very generalization—become a shared ﬁction (“honest
fakes”; Knight 2010), a pantomime performance that reverses
the mate recognition system: “wrong species, wrong sex, wrong
time” (Knight, Power, and Watts 1995).

Cheap-But-Honest Signals Hypothesis
Based on earlier work comparing the performance characteristics of pigments and beads (Kuhn and Stiner 2007; but see

Watts et al.

Early Evidence for Brilliant Ritualized Display

Watts 2010), a premise of Kuhn’s pigment hypothesis is that—
applied to the body—pigments are “not well suited to expressing quantity or cost” (Kuhn 2014:45). A second premise
is that early pigments (and early manifestations of much later
signaling technologies) occurred in egalitarian social worlds
with well-aligned ﬁtness interests. Supporting this (although
coming later in the argument), it is noted that archaeological evidence consistent with “small co-resident groups of cooperating non-kin” predate pigments (Kuhn 2014:47).2 These
premises inform the hypothesis that pigments “are most suitable for expressing honest, low-cost signals” whose initial use
reﬂects efforts to coordinate action through small-scale rituals that promoted shared identity and cooperation (Kuhn
2014:46, citing Sosis and Alcorta 2003; Sosis, Kress, and Boster
2007; although Sosis treats group ritual as costly signaling).3
This is considered “a response to increases in group sizes and
cohesiveness” during the later Middle Pleistocene, resulting
from the development of small, coresident groups of cooperating nonkin. Although ﬁtness interests are presumed to be
well-aligned, larger groups meant that members had “diverse
but potentially congruent interests” (Kuhn 2014:47, emphasis
in original). Much later increases in the size and/or differentiation of social groups led to more divergent interests and a
need for costlier signals. The hypothesis signiﬁcantly departs
from Kuhn’s earlier proposal that pigment use began as individual display (Kuhn and Stiner 2007). The predictions of the
two models and how these align with the data to be presented
will be considered in the “Discussion.”

Early Pigment Use
That pigment use can only reliably be inferred from ~300 Ka
largely rests on evidence from Terra Amata in France (de
Lumley 1966), Hunsgi Locality V in southern India (Paddaya
1976), and GnJh-15 in Kenya (McBrearty and Brooks 2000).
At Terra Amata, polish (“lustrée”) was reported on the ends
of pieces of ochre, but this remains to be conﬁrmed, and the
ochre’s manuport status has been questioned (Wreschner
1985); at Hunsgi, Bednarik (1990) described a ground facet
on a “haematite” pebble; at GnJh-15, utilization rests on an
undocumented claim for ochred grindstones. None of the
evidence has been adequately published, but provisionally we
consider the inference of pigment use at some or all of these
sites to be reasonable. The estimate of 300 Ka is a minimum at
Terra Amata and Hunsgi (Power, Sommer, and Watts 2013),
GnJh-15 is 1284,000 year ago (Deino and McBrearty 2002).

2. The literature cited by Kuhn to infer “co-resident groups of
cooperating non-kin” is essentially the same we cite for the development
of home bases.
3. Sosis, Kress, and Boster (2007) consider ritual body painting to be
low in cost relative to permanent body marking (correlating with external warfare), not that it is intrinsically low in cost.

289

Pigment use 1400 Ka has been suggested at Twin Rivers
(Zambia; Barham 2002:183), but conservative interpretation
of the dating and site formation processes supports an age
≤266 Ka (Barham et al. 2000:181). The predominance of specularite in this assemblage—a glittery form of hematite only
known for visual display—leaves little doubt as to a pigment
status. The only non-African claim for greater antiquity concerns Isernia la Pineta, Italy (~610 Ka; Coltorti et al. 2005),
where some stones bore red coloration (Cremaschi and Peretto
1988:1,036).
GnJh-15 and Twin Rivers suggest that initial pigment use
in Africa associates with the early Middle Stone Age (MSA),
but there are numerous claims concerning probably coeval
and earlier African Middle Pleistocene contexts (Chavaillon
and Berthelet 2004:69; Watts 2009, table 4.2; see supplementary online material in Watts 2010 for missing bibliography).4
Most lack radiometric dating, none of the materials have been
described in detail, only one has been illustrated (Beaumont
1990a, ﬁg. 4), and there are only three reports of modiﬁcation consistent with pigment use (Beaumont 1990a; Beaumont and Bednarik 2013:11; Jones 1940:17). There is, therefore, generally little basis for evaluation. In this article, we
present fresh observations that permit evaluation of some of
the claims for Fauresmith and Acheulean pigments from South
Africa’s Northern Cape Province (Beaumont and Bednarik
2013:11–12; Beaumont and Vogel 2006:222), claims based on
Peter Beaumont’s ﬁeldwork over the past 35 years. There are
prima facie grounds for caution in several cases: reported scraped
specularite in the Fauresmith at Kathu Pan 1 (Beaumont and
Bednarik 2013:11) is not corroborated by the cited literature
(Beaumont 1990b, 2004b), similarly with claims for specularite
and red ochre in Late Acheulean contexts at Kathu Pan and
Kathu Townlands (Beaumont and Vogel 2006:222, citing Beaumont 1990b); the most startling claim, that pigments at Wonderwerk Cave extend back ~1.1 Ma (Beaumont and Bednarik
2013:12), rests on the observation that material similar to hematite lenses above the cave (Beaumont 1990c:125) was encountered through most of the Acheulean sequence (Beaumont
2004b:33).
Recent and ongoing research in Northern Cape Province,
following up on Beaumont’s ﬁeldwork, is reevaluating several
contexts grouped together under the label Fauresmith, indicating a transitional status between the Acheulean of the Earlier
Stone Age (ESA) and the MSA (Chazan 2015; Chazan and
Horwitz 2009; Chazan et al. 2008, 2013; Porat et al. 2010;
Wilkins 2013; Wilkins and Chazan 2012; Wilkins et al. 2012).
There remain unresolved issues concerning the taxonomic validity of the Fauresmith and its designation as transitional
(Underhill 2011; Wilkins 2013); nevertheless, particular significance is placed on the co-occurrence of prepared-core pro-

duction of blades and convergent (Levallois) points with biface
manufacture (although questions remain about the association of bifaces in some contexts). The chronological resolution for Fauresmith-designated assemblages—including the
top spits of stratum 2a at Canteen Kopje, stratum 4a at Kathu
Pan 1, and excavation 6 at Wonderwerk Cave—remains the
subject of ongoing research, but all indications point to an
age range between approximately 600 and 300 Ka. The Fauresmith parallels similar developments in East Africa (Johnson and McBrearty 2012) and, at the younger end of the timerange, in the Levant (Shimelmitz, Barkai, and Gopher 2011);
it also provides the earliest evidence for stone-tipped spears
(Wilkins et al. 2012, 2015).

We present the ﬁrst detailed accounts of selected earth pigments from Kathu Pan 1 and Wonderwerk Cave and two previously reported pieces from Canteen Kopje (ﬁg. 1).

Geological Setting
The Vaal Drainage cuts through late Archean and initial
Paleoproterozoic lavas. It also preserves relic Miocene (Upper Gravels) and Pleistocene (Lower Gravels) terraces. At
Canteen Kopje, the Lower (“Younger”) Gravels are largely
the colluvial ﬁll of a paleo-loop of the Vaal (De Witt 2008). A

Early Evidence for Brilliant Ritualized Display

short distance northwest of the Vaal River rises the Ghaap
Escarpment, giving onto the Ghaap Plateau, largely comprising Paleoproterozoic rocks of the Transvaal Supergroup—dolomite of the Campbellrand Subgroup and conformably overlying banded ironstone formations (BIFs) of the Asbesheuwels
Subgroup (Kuruman and Danielskuil Iron Formations). The
ironstone generally consists of alternating bands of iron (magnetite or hematite) and chert. The Kuruman Hills are a prominent feature on the plateau; their arced line delineates the eastern edge of a large anticline, the Maremane Dome. Dolomite’s
permeability has restricted the development of surface drainages, particularly to the east of the hills. Wonderwerk Cave is
a solution tube on the hills’ eastern ﬂank.
Parallel to the western ﬂank of the Kuruman Hills, forming
an inner arc to the dome, lies one of the world’s largest highgrade hematite deposits (Beukes, Gutzmer, and Mukhopadhyay
2003). Localized collapses of BIF into karstic erosion features
in the dolomite led to the leaching of silica and supergene enrichment of hematite, with a siliceous breccia (Wolhaarkop
Breccia) at the bottom, overlain by predominantly laminated
and brecciated ores (Maremane Iron Formation). The Wolhaarkop Breccia is also associated with manganese (Moore
et al. 2011; van der Merwe 2010). Subsequent erosion produced conglomeritic (detrital) iron ores in the lower portion
of the overlying Gamagara Formation (Olifantshoek Supergroup). The ores (and other hard-rock geology) are widely
masked by Tertiary calcretes and sands, outcrops are primarily
isolated low hills or rises, arcing from Sishen in the north (close
to Kathu Pan) to beyond Postmasburg in the south. The ore
is generally hard microcrystalline hematite, unsuitable for use
as pigment; however, later hydrothermal activity resulted in
localized but widely distributed specularite in secondary veins
throughout the Wolhaarkop, Maremane, and lower Gamagara succession (Beukes, Gutzmer, and Mukhopadhyay 2003;
van Deventer 2010:28). Ancient specularite workings occur
along the outcrop length of the Maremane/ Wolhaarkop couplet (Beaumont 1973), the most signiﬁcant being Tsantsabane
or Blinkklipkop, near Postmasburg. Whether by direct procurement or trade, in the 1820s, specularite from this underground
mine was said to be distributed over ~500 km (Burchell [1822–
1824] 1953:256). Tsantsabane was also a source of soft, red hematite (Cambell 1815:230), which we equate with Wagner’s
(1928:183) “Eisenrham,” a “ﬁne purplish-red ochreous variety”
of hematite.
An ancient pattern of north-trending drainage west of the
Kuruman Hills (Haddon and McCarthy 2005) may have
brought ore-body material into Kathu Pan but excludes transport toward Wonderwerk or the Vaal drainage. The only input
of ironstone into the Vaal was in the Permo-Carboniferous
glaciation, represented by isolated Dwyka deposits, with ironstone a minor component (De Wit 2004). An ethnohistorical
account mentions a “ﬁne red ochre” pigment procured near
Danielskuil (Stow 1872:68), ~37 km south of Wonderwerk;
this may have been an exceptionally weathered expression of

291

Kuruman Iron Formation. Protracted weathering of ironstone
also produced a ﬁne yellow ochre close to Wonderwerk (Bassett 2001:14).

Archaeological Context
Materials from Beaumont’s excavations are curated in the
McGregor Museum (Kimberley, South Africa). New ﬁeldwork, ongoing at Kathu Pan 1 and Wonderwerk, has been
undertaken at all three sites (see above for the most relevant
publications). Here we summarize the archaeological contexts,
dating, and associated artifacts.
Kathu Pan 1
This is an inﬁll site within an erosional feature in Tertiary
calcretes. Stratum 3 contains abraded MSA artifacts (poor in
blades) in a dark brown gravely unit, interpreted as a high-energy
alluvial aggregate, and associated with an OSL estimate of
291  45 Ka. Stratum 4a has been observed both in gravely
spring vents and, in recent reexcavation, on a sandy horizontal
surface. Both lithologies are yellow. The study of the geomorphological relationship between these contexts is in process,
but lithic and faunal contents of the vents seem to rule out signiﬁcant upward movement of material from stratum 4b. A
combined U-series and electron spin resonance dating of an
Equus tooth and OSL dating of sands, both directly associated
with stratum 4a artifacts in a vent, produced ages of ~500 Ka
(OSL provided a minimum estimate of 464  47 Ka; a weighted
mean for the U-series and electron spin resonance results provided an estimate of 542 þ 140, 107 Ka). The artifacts in
stratum 4a are predominantly fairly fresh, characterized by
prepared convergent ﬂake and blade production. It remains
to be demonstrated whether all bifaces in stratum 4a are unambiguously associated; a high proportion are worn and come
from the lower spits (Wilkins 2013). Stratum 4b consists of two
components: a Later Acheulean with some extraordinarily reﬁned and symmetrical bifaces, and an underlying Early Acheulean (M. Chazan, personal observation). We currently have no
age determinations, but abundant dental remains assigned to
Elephas recki suggest an age 1550 Ka (Faith et al. 2012).
The predominant lithic raw material throughout is locally
procured ironstone (primary outcrops on Kathu Townlands,
~7 km east). A signiﬁcant proportion of the stratum 3 ironstone and smaller amounts in stratum 4 has been severely
weathered, sometimes resulting in an “ochreous” material, tentatively attributed to leaching of silica by alkaline groundwater (Beaumont 1990b:80; Wilkins 2013:100). The nearest outcrops of the Manganore, Wolhaarkop, Gamagara succession
are ~11 km south (3 km into the Sishen property), on slightly
rising ground (van Schalkwyk and Beukes 1986, ﬁg.18b). Surface outcroppings on this and the adjacent property of Bruce
have largely been quarried away, but specularite was presumably present; it is reported from core samples (Gutzmer et al.

2006), and ancient specularite quarries have been identiﬁed
on all the farms immediately southeast of Bruce (Lylyfeld,
Demaneng, and Mashwening), between 12.5 km and 26 km
from Kathu Pan (Beaumont 1973; Beaumont and Bednarik
2013).
Wonderwerk Cave
This wide cave extends 140 m straight into a hill. Excavation 1, ~14 m from the current entrance, comprises ~5 m of
Later Stone Age and ESA sequences. Contrary to Beaumont’s
description (Beaumont and Vogel 2006), we found no evidence in the upper levels of the ESA sequence for small bifaces and, more signiﬁcantly, no evidence for blade production such as might be expected of a Fauresmith industry (Chazan
et al. 2008). However, further analysis has found individual
artifacts from upper stratum 8 and stratum 7 that might indicate a typological relationship to the Fauresmith (Chazan
2015). Bifaces predominate, but artifact density is extremely
low throughout the Acheulean, suggesting that the front of
the cave did not serve as a base camp at this time (Chazan
and Horwitz 2009). Excavation 6 sampled up to 2 m of deposit over 25 m2 right at the back of the cave, where it is very
gloomy. There is no obvious functional reason for repeated
use of this area. Analysis of these lithic assemblages is still
in progress, but to date most material is consistent with the
Fauresmith, with blade and point production associated with
bifaces, nearly all in fresh condition. No underlying Acheulean
has been identiﬁed, and no changes in the lithic industry have
been detected. Artifact and faunal densities are considerably
greater than in the ESA of excavation 1; preliminary taphonomic analysis indicates a high incidence of carnivore and
porcupine activity. The paucity of primary ﬂaking debris suggests that tools were made elsewhere (Chazan and Horwitz
2009), consistent with the poor illumination. The assemblages include numerous quartz crystals (only one with possible knapping scars)5 and ﬂaked ironstone slabs (one deliberately incised;
Jacobson et al. 2012, ﬁg. 4; see below and CA1 online supplement ﬁg. S6B); both materials are obtainable from immediately
outside the cave. Beyond attribution to the Fauresmith, there is
limited chronological control. A U-series assay on a stalagmite
(square CC148, stratum 3, 40–45 cm) of 187  8 Ka is reported
as a minimum age (Beaumont and Vogel 2006, table 2).
Canteen Kopje
The sequence consists of Younger Gravels overlain by aeolian Hutton Sands. The gravels incorporate abundant Acheulean artifacts. The small “Fauremith” assemblage (which may
equally be early MSA), characterized by blades, Levallois points,
and retouched points, is restricted to the top 30 cm of the
gravel and its surface. These are mostly in a fresh condition;

two worn hand axes (one questionable) are not considered
diagnostic (McNabb and Beaumont 2011). Single-grain OSL
dating indicates that deposition of the Hutton Sands had begun by ~300 Ka, providing a minimum age for this assemblage (Chazan et al. 2013). Some artifacts are jaspelite, an
ironstone variant lacking pronounced banding; some of these
have round, white macrofossils (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S7B,
S7C), similar to jaspelite exploited at the Late Acheulean quarry
site of Kathu Townlands (Danielskuil Formation; Walker,
Lukich, and Chazan 2014), ~175 km NW of Canteen Kopje. The
closest primary outcrops of this Formation are ~90 km west.

Methods
Full accounts of potential pigments at Kathu and Wonderwerk are in preparation; here we report and describe those
materials we conﬁdently consider to be pigments (along with
some of the most pertinent questionable cases). The grounds
for such conﬁdence were contextually arrived at, using guiding rather than formal criteria: (i) the material should be appropriate (eye-catching; in terms of color or reﬂective properties, soft or friable enough to readily produce a powder which
should have staining power); (ii) ideally, there should be evidence for powder production (grinding or scraping); and
(iii) in the absence of such evidence, there should be no grounds
for confusion with lithic raw materials (even in a highly weathered state) or natural components of the deposit.
The descriptive procedures are those used in the analysis of
MSA pigments from Pinnacle Point Cave 13B (Watts 2010).
For Natural Colour System (NCS) notations of streak, a digital
scanner (NCS Colour Scan 2) was used for preliminary assessments (providing readings to the nearest 10% intervals in
blackness, chroma, and hue), with naked-eye revisions for more
resolved notation. No color notation system captures specularite’s glittery appearance (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S8).

The square-by-square assignation of arbitrary 10-cm or 20-cm
spits to stratigraphic units and industrial complexes follows
J. Wilkins’ assessments based on techno-typological traits preparatory to her thesis research, supported by her detailed analysis of materials from four squares (F21, F23, C21, and C23)
and color changes in retained ﬁne-sediment samples from ﬁve
squares. Excavated volumes for stratum 3, stratum 4a, and
stratum 4b were approximately 5.9 m3, 8.1 m3, and 18.4 m3, of
which 45.8%, 97.5%, and 54.3%, respectively, were examined
to identify potential pigments. Lithics were counted for most
examined spits (for 42.4%, 88.9%, and 45.7% of total excavated
volumes). Operationalizing the informal pigment criteria meant

excluding dense but hard hematized material (typically hematized bands of BIF but probably including some laminar
Manganore Iron Formation), “ochreous” weathered BIF, and
indeterminate red materials softer than Mohs hardness 5 but
not particularly dense (i.e., not obviously soft hematite). Examination of curated ﬁne and coarse sediment fractions and
ﬁeld observations at nearby streambeds enabled an assessment
of potential natural components of the deposits.
The largest category is specularite, present in the MSA (stratum 3, n ¼ 10), mixed stratum 3/4a (n ¼ 3), and Fauresmith
(stratum 4a, n ¼ 8) horizons. It occurs as dense, glittery, more
or less friable nodules. Depending on friability and particle
size, it leaves either a dark red metallic residue on the ﬁngers
or a black and silver residue (the more friable pieces). Average
streak was 6810 Y93R (n ¼ 12; standard deviation [SD]: 0706
Y06R), very dark, of low chroma and high redness (poorly
perceptible owing to the darkness and low chroma).6 The
coarse, friable fabric means that original surfaces are rarely
preserved (particularly in stratum 3). It seems unlikely that
the most friable pieces could have washed into the pan from
at least 11 km away, but the abraded state of most of the stratum 3 lithics suggests that specularite was washed in from hominin activities in the more immediate environment.
Of the eight specularite from stratum 4a, six came from the
uppermost spit (40–60 cm) of one square (F21). Within Wilkins’ fully analyzed sample, material from spits of this depth
(C21, F21) assigned to this stratum were unusual in having a
high proportion (~19%) of rolled lithics (Wilkins 2013, ﬁg. 11),
a trait more consistent with overlying stratum 3. We therefore
note that, in addition to the technological grounds for assignment to stratum 4a, sediment samples from C21 were brown
in spit 20–40 cm and yellow in spit 40–60 cm (Wilkins 2013,
ﬁg. 6), consistent with geomorphological observations on the two
strata. The two remaining pieces also came from the top spits
assigned to this aggregate in their respective squares (F25 and
D21). It is likely that these pieces are best associated with the
Fauresmith, but the possibility remains that they are intrusive
from the MSA.
Two stratum 4a specularite show deﬁnite utilization. One
(ﬁg. 2A; CA1 supplement ﬁg. S1A) was scraped over most of
one surface, resulting in a slightly concave facet that probably
contributed to its preservation. Some initial points of entry of
the scraping tool are visible (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S1A). The
second example (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S1B) preserves a small
remnant of an original surface with traces of two broad striations. Several other specimens, from both strata, had unusually
ﬂat surfaces in an otherwise rounded morphology, suggestive
of ground facets (e.g., CA1 supplement ﬁg. S1C).
Specularite sometimes grades into what we have designated
“specular hematite,” a more ﬁnely specular expression that cannot be described as glittery, although fresh exposures glisten in
bright light (n ¼ 10; 3 in stratum 3, 2 in mixed stratum 3/4a,
2 in stratum 4a, 1 in mixed stratum 4a/4b, and 2 in stratum 4b).
6. Mean NCS for KP1 specularite excludes ﬁve cases with no chroma
and two where hue fell in the red∶blue rather than yellow∶red ratio.

This was recovered down to the upper spits of stratum 4b.
Average streak (6812 Y87R, SD: 0608 Y10R, n ¼ 9) is indistinguishable from specularite. The most compelling case for
utilization was from the top spit of stratum 4b in B20 (120–
140 cm; ﬁg. 2B; CA1 supplement ﬁg. S1D). This large nodule
lacked unequivocal aligned striations but appears intensively
ground; 7 ﬂat facets covered ~70% of the surface area. The
overlying spit was assigned to stratum 4a, the only 4a spit
in this square (spit 80–100 cm was designated “mixed stratum
3/4a”); given the arbitrary excavation units and lack of compelling supporting evidence from stratum 4b, admixture seems
likely. The other piece from stratum 4b came from a spit in the
top 30 cm. It was much smaller (4 g) and naturally worn; it
could be a natural wash-in.
A third distinctive category was “greasy hematite,” dense,
soft, and greasy to touch, with a submetallic luster and reddishbronze color. This was recovered down to the middle of
stratum 4a (5 in stratum 3, 1 in mixed stratum 3/4a, and 2 in
stratum 4a). Of the two stratum 4a pieces, one (a mix of greasy
hematite and specular hematite) came from the top spit in
D21 (60–80 cm), and the other came from D20—with two
overlying and two underlying 10-cm spits assigned to this stratum (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S1E; see CA1 supplement ﬁg. S8
for streak). Average streak (5426 Y84R, SD: 0811 Y09R, valid
n ¼ 7) is appreciably lighter and more chromatic than previous categories, consequently appearing much redder.
A fourth utilized piece—categorized as ground “weathered
hematite”—came from a mixed stratum 4a/4b spit (ﬁg. 2C;
CA1 supplement ﬁg. S1F). As a vesicular, red material of only
moderate density, it falls outside the criteria for conﬁdently
identifying pigments, but the broad (~0.8 mm) parallel grinding striations—covering most of one face—are unequivocal.
These are brighter than most of the rest of the piece and bear
some ﬁne detail. Given the potential behavioral signiﬁcance of
grinding at this level in the sequence, the possibility that it
occurred after excavation has to be considered. We therefore
note that (i) ancient striations are sometimes brighter than
the ground upon which they occur (d’Errico 2008, ﬁg. 1b; Watts
2009, plate 4.7); (ii) the illustrated face shows recent scufﬁng
(attributable to storage with lithics), which is brighter than the
striations (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S1F); (iii) if mischievously
abraded (to make a case for ancient grinding), we might expect
the piece to have been bagged separately (as done with some
specularite) and for Beaumont to have drawn attention to the
piece; and (iv) the general lack of sorting of potential pigments
from lithics suggests that sorters were not alerted to the distinction, so streak-testing is unlikely. On balance, we consider
this to be a fragment of fortuitously preserved, anciently ground
red pigment.
Pigments in stratum 3 have not previously been reported.
The stratum 3 dating estimate implies that they are among
the oldest MSA pigments. The presence of pigments in the
Fauresmith of stratum 4a is conﬁrmed, predominantly specularite rather than “unmodiﬁed or ﬂaked soft red haematite”
(Beaumont 1990b:80). Although specularite is restricted to the
topmost stratum 4a spits, specular hematite and greasy hematite

were encountered in deeper spits. The absence of specularite
(and greasy hematite) from stratum 4b is striking. This visually
arresting material was locally available and would have attracted the attention of anyone looking for eye-catching materials to augment a ritualized display. Over 15,700 lithics were
counted for stratum 4b, compared to just over 12,000 for stratum 4a and ~5,900 for stratum 3; an absence in this context
should be regarded as signiﬁcant. Beaumont and Bednarik reported “half a dozen small and sometimes slightly rounded soft
red haematite” in stratum 4b (2013:11); however, Beaumont
sometimes used “haematite” inappropriately, including materials we categorize as iron hydroxides and probable cave sediments (see below). In the absence of diagnostic utilization, we
see no basis on which to infer that such pieces were “Pigment
manuports” (Beaumont and Bednarik 2013), partly because of
the ochreous state of some of the ironstone lithics (sometimes
lacking signs of ﬂaking) and the possibility of rare natural washins from Sishen (e.g., possibly the small nodule of “specular
hematite” from stratum 4b). That pigments may occasionally
have been used in the youngest Acheulean cannot be ruled
out, but the weight of evidence strongly suggests they are restricted to the Fauresmith and MSA, with most of the Fauresmith material coming from the upper spits, suggesting that
Fauresmith use was initially irregular.
Wonderwerk
The “haematite lenses” in the dolomite above the cave (Beaumont 1990c:125) are nodules and horizontal veins of ferrugi-

nous material (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S2). They occasionally
stain the dolomite but are themselves almost invariably extremely hard to streak (6 in Mohs scale), suggesting a high silica
content; the few streaks obtained were yellowish-brown or midbrown, indicative of iron hydroxide rather than hematite. Comparable materials were encountered in excavation 1 and excavation 6 (e.g., CA1 supplement ﬁg. S3D), but their hardness,
streak properties (when obtainable), and the absence of any
utilization provide no grounds for inferring a pigment status.
At excavation 1, pigments were identiﬁed in Beaumont’s
strata 5 and 8. Stratum 5 provided two specularite and a small
piece of “red ochre,” but mixing with LSA material (including
ostrich eggshell beads) makes an ESA association insecure.
Stratum 8 provided two pieces. One was a soft, dense, greasy
piece of hematite from Q23, indistinguishable from the “greasy
hematite” at Kathu Pan 1. However, LSA deposits immediately overlay stratum 8 in this square, so the piece must also
be treated as probably intrusive. The second piece was a tiny
fragment (10:5 mm#7:6 mm) of weathered hematitic material, bearing small remnants of four parallel striations on a
partially exfoliated edge facet, consistent with grinding (ﬁg. 3;
CA1 supplement ﬁg. S3A). There were also traces of probable use on the edge of a main surface, although these are
harder to interpret and may conceivably be due to trampling (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S3A). The fragment came from
the top spit (0–5 cm) of stratum 8 in square S29, where the
stratum is overlain by a thin (~5 cm) presence of stratum 7.
The context is within the top 10 cm of secure Acheulean
deposits in this square. Displacement from the LSA cannot

be ruled out, but we consider this to be the best evidence for
pigment use toward the end of the Acheulean sequence at
Wonderwerk.
Beaumont’s stratum 9 is thought to contain the Brunhes/
Matuyama magnetic reversal, placing it in the terminal Lower
Pleistocene and initial Middle Pleistocene. Stratum 9b provided a scraped slab of superﬁcially weathered dolomite (CA1
supplement ﬁg. S3B). The aligned striations, covering one surface, are broad and square proﬁled. However, the powder is
dull brown (4015 Y40R) with little staining power. A similar
piece was recovered in a younger context at the back of the
cave (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S4A), also dolomite, with a distinct
(precipitated) cortical layer, bearing broad scraping striations,
providing a dull, light-grey streak (4010 Y30R). While the stratum 9 piece demonstrates powder manufacture by the early
Middle Pleistocene (for purposes unknown), it cannot be considered good evidence for early pigment use.
The oldest Acheulean assemblage at Wonderwerk is from
Stratum 11, with a cosmogenic age estimate of 1.17 Ma at its
base. Some pieces of reddish-brown and bright red material
were recovered, bagged by Beaumont respectively as “ochre”
and “haematite.” This material was extremely lightweight and
friable, the powder having no staining power. Fourier transform infrared spectra for one specimen (CA1 supplement
ﬁg. S3C) showed absorptions of slightly altered clay, apatite,
quartz, organics, and calcite, interpreted as probably cave sediment, possibly slightly burnt (Francesco Berna, personal com-

munication, July 1, 2014). There is no reason to consider this
material pigment.
To date, less than half of the material from excavation 6
has been examined, providing a range of potential pigments,
including seven pieces that we are conﬁdent about: four specularite (two utilized); a ground piece of weathered iron hydroxide; and two pieces of soft, greasy hematite (one possibly
gouged). We reserve judgment on two further pieces: another
scraped piece of weathered dolomite and an incised ironstone
slab.
The specularite lacks the friable expressions of Kathu Pan 1;
it comprises a cobble, two pebble-size worn nodules, and a large,
angular chunk. Brown patination on the cobble and one of the
smaller nodules suggests they were surface pick-ups. Both main
surfaces of the nonpatinated nodule bear single pairs of deeply
gouged striations; there is also at least one probably ground
facet (ﬁg. 4A; CA1 supplement ﬁg. S4B). The cobble (ﬁg. 4B;
CA1 supplement ﬁg. S4C) shows fairly extensive edge grinding (but no unequivocal striations); the largest ground area
comprises two subfacets, and a small facet is on the opposite edge (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S4C). The large chunk is fresh
and angular; the specularite is intimately mixed with quartz
(CA1 supplement ﬁg. S4D), suggesting a Wolhaarkop Breccia derivation. The quartz makes grinding impracticable, but
two faces have thin, more homogenous layers of specularite,
which could potentially have been exploited. Beaumont and
Bednarik (2013:11) state that Wonderwerk specularite “came

potential sources are small outcrops of the Manganore/Wolhaarkop couplet ~38 km to the southwest (van Schalkwyk
and Beukes 1986, ﬁg. 1). Mashwening, ~47 km west of Wonderwerk, is the closest identiﬁed prehistoric specularite working. A test trench adjacent to the workings provided a biface

stratum?) overwhelmingly comprised specularite, with tiny
amounts of greasy hematite (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S8). No
natural agencies could have brought such material closer to
Wonderwerk.
The two pieces of soft, dense hematite are greasy, with a
submetallic luster, comparable to the “greasy hematite” at
Kathu Pan 1 and Mashwening. One piece (ﬁg. 4C; CA1 supplement ﬁg. S5A) shows a deep, rectangular cavity that may
have been gouged out. The streak of this piece (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S8) was surprisingly dark, while the other (CA1 supplement ﬁg. S5B) was appreciably lighter and more chromatic
(CA1 supplement ﬁg. S8).

Current Anthropology

We suspect that the ground piece of weathered iron hydroxide was originally hematite, hydrated to an iron oxidehydroxide (e.g., goethite) after deposition. It was described as
“slightly buttery,” resembling the greasy hematite, but not
as dense. One face bears ﬁve or six aligned, worn striations
(ﬁg. 4D; CA1 supplement ﬁg. S5C), predominantly in a yellow, heavily hydrated zone, but two small residual patches
of dark-brown, harder material (comprising the bulk of the
piece) emerge through the surface weathering, showing denser,
ﬁner striations. Our postdepositional weathering interpretation would suggest that the whole piece originally provided a
redder streak.
The weathered dolomite (ﬁg. 4E; CA1 supplement ﬁg. S6A),
from stratum 4b, comprises four deeply scraped, conjoining
fragments (three illustrated). It is friable and leached, with
two small nodules of ferruginous material resembling those
in the dolomite above the cave (others are only distinguishable as dark-brown smudges). Unlike the previously discussed
scraped dolomite, the color is consistent with use as a pigment and is unexpectedly chromatic and red but again has
little staining power. Despite this failing, we would probably
have categorized this as pigment but for the previously discussed brown cases. As it is, no unequivocal assessment can be
made. If it were pigment, the stratigraphic provenance would
imply processing from early on in the use of the back of the
cave. It might also suggest that very local procurement of
poor-quality red ochre preceded regional procurement of specularite and greasy hematite.
The incised slab of banded ironstone (CA1 supplement
ﬁg. S6B) from stratum 4 (W146, 30–40 cm) may also have
served as pigment. Utilization occurs on a thin surface layer
of slightly weathered hematite. It consists of a restricted area
of polish together with aligned, very ﬁne, “v”-proﬁled grinding
striations and broader, more sinuous striations; a prominent
sinuous striation runs parallel to an edge and appears to be
the result of one incising action. The combined use-wear could
only have produced a tiny amount of powder. If this served
as pigment, it would lend weight to the tentative inferences
concerning the previous piece.
Canteen Kopje
As originally reported (Beaumont 2004a:28), the small “Fauresmith” assemblage provided a “cache of specularite nodules.”
Only two pieces were found in our examination (see also
McNabb and Beaumont 2011:53), both fairly large, angular
chunks in fresh condition, curated as having come from the
surface of spit 0–10 cm. One has a previously unreported small,
ﬂat facet on an edge, indicating light grinding (ﬁg. 5; CA1
supplement ﬁg. S7A; see also CA1 supplement ﬁg. S8 for
streak). The nearest specularite outcrops are around Postmasburg, ~170 km west, with no known alluvial system capable of
transporting clasts east (specularite is not reported in Dwykaage glacial gravels at nearby Nooitgedacht, where weathering
has removed all but well-rounded, siliceous pebbles; de Wit

Volume 57, Number 3, June 2016

2004). Although such a transport distance would be exceptional for this period, it is supported by the associated jaspelite blades, a raw material thought to come from at least 90 km
west. Pigments are absent in the large Acheulean assemblages
of units 2a and 2b (Beaumont and Bednarik 2013).
A fourth site in the region, Nooitgedacht 2, probably provides additional support for Fauresmith pigment use. Eleven
kilometers downstream from Canteen Kopje, Beaumont (1990a)
made a systematic collection of artifacts from trapped gravels
on the Nooitgedacht Platform, exposed by diamond diggers’
removal of Hutton Sands (see de Wit 2004 for geological context). In an analysis of nine purported Fauresmith assemblages (not including Kathu or Wonderwerk), Nooitgedacht
2 was judged “the most likely candidate for a true occurrence”
(Underhill 2012:165). Beaumont illustrated a ground piece of
“haematite” (1990a, ﬁg. 4)—the only previously published illustration of a pigment from an apparently pre-MSA context. Unfortunately, by 2009, this piece was missing (Underhill
2012:154).

Discussion
Beaumont’s long-standing claim that pigment use extends to
the Fauresmith (Beaumont 1990a, 1990b) is conﬁrmed. Caution
dictates that we treat the ground piece of specular-hematite
from a spit assigned to the top of stratum 4b at Kathu Pan as
probably derived from stratum 4a. No other deﬁnite pigments
were recovered from stratum 4b; given the large size of the examined lithic sample, this provides reasonably compelling evidence of absence, rather than absence of evidence. Most of the
stratum 4a pigments came from the upper spits, but the piece of
greasy hematite from the middle of the aggregate, the ground
specular-hematite, and the ground “weathered hematite” from
a mixed stratum 4a/4b spit suggest that the behavior goes back
to the onset of systematic blade and point manufacture. Canteen Kopje, Wonderwerk, and probably Nooitgedacht 2 support the general coassociation. Two possible pigments from
Wonderwerk excavation 6 stratum 4 suggest that pigment use
may extend to initial (Fauresmith) use of the back of the cave.
The only reasonably strong evidence that pigment use might
extend to the Acheulean is the tiny fragment from stratum
8 of excavation 1 at Wonderwerk.
Specularite circumvents the objections most frequently raised
about assigning a pigment status to ferruginous materials: its
only use seems to have been for visual display, and it is unlikely
to be a natural component of archaeological deposits. Natural
inclusion is possible at Kathu, but the specularite’s friability,
temporal distribution, absence in stream-beds, and archaeological sediment fractions make this unlikely, whereas utilization renders the issue fairly academic; natural inclusion was
ruled out at Wonderwerk and Canteen Kopje. The inferred
minimum transfer distance of ~38 km for the Wonderwerk
specularite and greasy hematite is notable, whereas that for
the Canteen Kopje specularite (~170 km) would be exceptional

for this period but seems to be supported by the jaspelite
ﬂakes.
The back of Wonderwerk is a unique ﬁnd context, as is
the suite of manuports (various pigments, quartz crystals, and
ironstone slabs). Chazan and Horwitz (2009) propose that
use of this space—more than 100 m deep inside the hill—was
related to its unusual sensory characteristics. It is suggestive
of a special place used for special occasions, consistent with
characteristics of ritual performance (Rappaport 1999). We
speculate that it was used for ﬁre-lit, body-painted, song-anddance performances, the performers glittering and red. The
location counts against proposals that early pigments provided “badging” in intergroup encounters (Dunbar 1999; Sterelny 2011); it may be consistent with either a homogenous
group of coritualists or the presence of an out-group drawn
from coresidents (e.g., afﬁnes).
Contrary to Beaumont and Bednarik (2013), we found no
good evidence for pigment use during the Acheulean at Kathu
Pan (see above) or Kathu Townlands. For Kathu Townlands
and adjacent Uitkoms, we examined large excavated samples
from several trenches (MM 6714, 6890) without encountering
any likely pigment; large-scale salvage excavations had similar
results (Walker, Lukich, and Chazan 2014). The “in situ unmodiﬁed specularite lump” seen in 2009 (Beaumont and Bednarik 2013:12) concerns road-grading that exposed Hutton
Sands and underlying deposits (Beaumont, personal communication, November 13, 2012). The technological character of
the Townlands assemblages (Beaumont 1990b) makes a Late

Acheulean association plausible, but the similarity of geological context to Canteen Kopje and Nooitgedacht 2 alerts
us to the possibility of a Fauresmith or early MSA association,
or a palimpsest. At Wonderwerk, despite a fairly compelling
pigment fragment from what is probably a secure context toward the end of the Acheulean sequence, we found no evidence
to support the claim for the behavior extending far back into
the Acheulean.
This evidence from the Northern Cape supports the idea
that pigment use developed as part of a package of behaviors,
which included the development of prepared core methods
and hunting with hafted spears, in the context of a poorly deﬁned Fauresmith transitional industry during the middle of
the Middle Pleistocene. From a broader—Old World—perspective, this period (from ~550 to ~300 Ka) correlates with
early evidence for home bases (see above).
The FCC hypothesis predicts early pigment use (i) not to
predate Middle Pleistocene brain size increase, (ii) to associate
with early evidence for home bases, (iii) to involve preferential
use of reds, and (iv) to be characterized by initial, sporadic use
of local materials. In the second stage, where a runaway sexualselection process is posited, it predicts that, (v) where suitably
red and saturated materials are locally unavailable, competition between female coalitions for more regular male investment should promote more costly regional or exotic procurement, and (vi) the last phase of brain size increase should
associate with a rapid shift from a mosaic pattern of no use,
irregular use, or localized regular use to a ubiquitous, regular

behavior. Predictions (i)–(iv) are directly relevant here, and
prediction (v) may be relevant as regular use and costly procurement could occur regionally before the predicted explosive spread.
Paleoanthropologists have pushed back the onset of Middle Pleistocene brain size increase from ~500 Ka (Leigh 1992)
to the early part of the epoch (780 Ka to ~600 Ka; Rightmire
2009). Nevertheless, prediction (i) would have been refuted
if Beaumont and Bednarik’s (2013:12) claim for pigments at
~1.1 Ma had been conﬁrmed (it still could be if the “early
Acheulean” at Hunsgi V proves of comparable age to Attirampakkan, ≥1.07 Ma; Pappu et al. 2011). The utilized chip
from Wonderwerk stratum 8 of excavation 1 is intriguing.
Accepting the context at face value, it presumably falls within
the latter part of the period of brain size increase associated
with the speciation of Homo heidelbergensis, suggesting that
the positive aspect to prediction (i)—that earliest pigment use
should occur during this period—also ﬁnds support. Speculatively, in predating widespread evidence for homebases, this
piece may hint at a role for body-painted ritual display in their
establishment. Although the Fauresmith aggregates discussed
do not directly address the establishment of home bases, as
previously noted, similar technological changes closely associate with this development, and the broad timing is consistent.
Any hypothesis concerning ritual display might predict use
of brilliant or otherwise eye-catching materials, but surprisingly few explicitly predict selection for red (Durkheim 1912;
Knight 1991). That locally available yellow ochre at Wonderwerk or manganese at Kathu Pan were not collected underscores the deliberate selection of several forms of hematite.
The FCC hypothesis, as a model of the origin of symbolic
culture, not only uniquely predicts a red focus on Darwinian
grounds, but cosmological aspects of the model generate the
additional prediction that redness and brilliance should associate with darkness (Knight 1991, 1997; Knight, Power, and
Watts 1995; Watts 2005, 2015; see Watts 2010, supplementary
online material, pp. 34, 35). Several observations are relevant
here: (i) redness and brilliance are consistently associated with
constructs of supernatural potency among southern African
hunter-gatherers (Watts 1999), most consistently in menarcheal ritual (Knight, Power, and Watts 1995); (ii) among the
simplest color lexicons studied in any detail (Heider 1972;
Jones and Meehan 1978; Levinson 2000), perhaps the only
common feature is the identiﬁcation of speciﬁcally dark, saturated reds as particularly salient (Watts 2010, supplementary
online material, p. 30);8 (iii) in the MSA, in addition to preferential use of the reddest, most saturated materials (Hodgskiss
2012, 2013; Watts 2009, 2010), there is suggestive evidence that
this focus extended to very dark values (rather than these
8. The salience of dark, saturated red is consistent with the naming
centroid for English “red,” where a dark value is expected owing to the
presence of “pink” and “orange” terms (Kay and Regier 2003, ﬁgure 4b); it
would not be predicted of simple color lexicons under the assumption that
terms’ signiﬁcata jointly partition the color space (see Kay and Mafﬁ 1999).

Volume 57, Number 3, June 2016

forming a distinct category focus; Watts 2010); and (iv) pigment use at the back of Wonderwerk implies that ﬁre-lit darkness was a valued sensory quality of ritual performance.
There is no African evidence for signiﬁcant further brain
size increase until our speciation (Watts 2014, table 16.1), approximately when regular red ochre use in southern African
rock shelters is thought to have become ubiquitous. The latter
pattern remains to be conﬁrmed by radiometric dating of several sequences but would be consistent with prediction (vi).
Kuhn’s cheap-but-honest signals hypothesis requires that
early pigments should be locally procured. If and when this
might change is unspeciﬁed, but his argument implies that
nonlocal procurement should not be seen before the Upper
Pleistocene, possibly not before the Upper Paleolithic (when
costlier signaling is identiﬁed). The tentatively inferred transfer
distances for Wonderwerk and Canteen Kopje would, if conﬁrmed by mineralogical analysis (see Kiehn et al. 2007a), contradict such an expectation.9 With closely aligned ﬁtness interests considered a precondition to honest, low-cost signals,
the archaeological inference that home bases predate pigments
may also be treated as an implicit prediction, one challenged
by our data. The hypothesis makes no predictions of past selective criteria (beyond the use of eye-catching materials) and
no connection between the medium and the message, nor does
it make predictions about who was selecting and who was signaling. That body painting is cheaper than the thousands of
beads in the Sunghir burials (~26 ka) is not contentious. But,
in evolutionary terms, relative to the earlier absence of compelling evidence for materially mediated signaling, the procurement (local or otherwise), processing, and application of
earth pigments represents unprecedented costs. Such de novo
costs and the visual qualities of specularite hardly accord with
the inconspicuous, private signals expected in coordinating action (Silk, Kaldor, and Boyd 2000).
Recalling that the comparison with beads (Kuhn and Stiner
2007) underpinned the premise that pigments do not express
cost effectively, we note two neglected performance characteristics of body painting. First, it has to be executed afresh
as the periodicity of ritual performance demands (a cost multiplier), making it intrinsically time-factored (suitable for marking out reproductive and environmental periodicities) in a way
that donning beads is not. Second, anything but the crudest
application requires a colleague, reliably signaling the presence
of allies. The complexity or otherwise of early body painting
can only be conjectured (see Durkheim 1912; Watts 2009), but
demonstrating the presence of allies is critical to the conﬂictdriven FCC hypothesis, whereas in Kuhn’s hypothesis all coresidents are allies, ritually reminding themselves of an overriding common interest, with no speciﬁed differentiating structure
deﬁning roles and obligations.
9. There are other early contexts where pigments appear to come from
further aﬁeld than lithic raw materials (for Hunsgi V, compare Padaya
1976:761 with Shipton, Petraglia, and Paddayya 2009, ﬁg. 16.8; for Twin
Rivers, compare Barham 2002:183 with Barham et al. 2000:190, 216).

Watts et al.

Early Evidence for Brilliant Ritualized Display

Finally, for the FCC hypothesis, cosmetics may or may not
indicate cost, but the time and energy spent on the entire ritual performance certainly does. This becomes the expensive
religious packaging of “beauty magic,” as described by Malinowski (1929), the deployment of the ornamented body to
invoke otherworldly powers (Power 2010). By contrast, Kuhn’s
hypothesis expects both cosmetics and early ritual performance
to be low in cost.

Conclusions
We conclude that, for the sites discussed, there is (i) compelling evidence of pigment’s absence in all but the youngest
Acheulean contexts, (ii) deﬁnite pigment use in a Fauresmith
context from at least ~500 Ka, and (iii) regionally widespread and regular use by ~300 Ka, which probably included
nonlocal raw material transfers. Additional work is needed
(i) to improve stratigraphic and chronometric control, which
may slightly push back initial use, but nothing like to the extent claimed by Beaumont and Bednarik (2013), and (ii) to
assess the feasibility of “ﬁngerprinting” archaeological and outcrop materials to address the provenancing issues raised.
The Fauresmith presents a novel package of behaviors that
correlate with broader evidence for the generalization of a
campsite-focused form of social organization. This suggests that
initial pigment use, while localized and rare, associates with this
process rather than following it, which is more consistent with
the predictions of the FCC hypothesis than with the cheapbut-honest signals hypothesis.
The inferred transfer distance of specularite to Wonderwerk and, more emphatically, to Canteen Kopje would, if conﬁrmed, seriously challenge cheap-but-honest signaling. Conversely, local procurement at ~500 Ka (Kathu Pan), with exotic
procurement suggested at ~300 Ka (Canteen Kopje), could—at
a regional scale—provide a time-frame for the FCC’s prediction concerning the emergence of competing coalitions (but
see below). The predominance of specularite does not challenge the FCC’s predicted focus on “blood reds,” as the hypothesis also predicts an association between redness, brilliance,
and darkness: specularite uniquely combines these properties,
and red pigments coassociate with specularite at Kathu Pan,
Wonderwerk, and Twin Rivers (Barham 2002; no signiﬁcance
can be attached to their absence at Canteen Kopje, owing to
small sample size).10
In sum, a broader range of the new observations can be accounted for by the FCC hypothesis than by honest, low-cost
signaling. In any event, the glittery nature of specularite and
the ﬁnd-context at Wonderwerk provide strong grounds for
inferring ﬁre-lit ritualized display, capable, in principle, of
grounding shared ﬁctions. If Watts (2014) is correct that pig10. Ethnohistorically, throughout the Setswana culture area, initiated
men applied a mixture of specularite and red hematite to their hair, creating a glistening cosmetic “cap.” Both materials were procured from Tsantsabane (Shillington 2011:12, 32).

301

ment use only became habitual throughout southern Africa
around the time of our speciation, the question arises of why
it took so long for shared ﬁctions to stabilize at the level of a
meta-population. This might be attributed to the interplay of
geological contingency and demography: a restricted area of
the Northern Cape providing a relatively rare, visually arresting material and relatively isolated population demes with
little interconnectedness. On the other hand, precisely this temporal pattern is theoretically predicted by the FCC hypothesis, because the most pronounced increase in cranial volumes
postdates ~300 Ka (de Miguel and Hennerberg 2001, ﬁg. 1),
placing renewed stress on maternal energy budgets, with concomitant pressure to compete for male investment. This, rather
than the interval between ~500 and ~300 Ka, seems a more
plausible context for invoking runaway sexual selection, where
the periodicity of ritual performance by female coalitions could
no longer be determined by the fertility status of individual members, and the reality-bound, partially deceptive displays
of counter dominance tipped over into reverse dominance/
reverse reality (Knight 2014; Power 2014), establishing symbolic culture.

It is well-known that human reasoning is affected by conﬁrmation bias (Nickerson 1998). The bias may be deliberate
in the form of selecting facts to suit a particular theory or
unwitting with selectivity of a much less conscious kind. I
am not sure which form is dominant here, but there is a deﬁnite agenda identiﬁable from the outset with the report of
new ﬁnds of pigment cast as a test of a long-held theory. The
theory (in summary) is that human society emerged from a
collective female-based deception intended to subvert male
dominance and to control reproductive rights. Menstrual blood
as a signal of impending fertility was elaborated by female

coalitions in the context of rituals that involved the use of
red ochre as body paint and blood symbol that signalled
the message to men that sex with women would be on their
terms. The consequence was the emergence of cooperation
from conﬂict, with cheaters controlled and a sense of group
identity formed through shared rituals. The sex-strike hypothesis, as ﬁrst proposed by Knight (1991), has since been
developed into a more layered confection of contingent actions with associated predictions for the archaeological record
(Knight et al. 1995; Watts 2014). Others will be better placed to
assess the plausibility of this theory as an evolutionary model,
but let me be up front about my own conﬁrmation bias.
I struggle to accept models of causation that require a level
of supposition that the archaeological record cannot support.
As Kuhn (2014:42) observes, we can speculate on the kinds of
messages encoded in artefacts, but the content of the messages will remain obscure. This is particularly true for the
Middle Pleistocene African record, which is poorly resolved
in terms of chronology and context. The idea of an ancestral
female cosmetic coalition draws on ethnographic support for
the association of red ochre with blood symbolism and, as interesting as these modern observations are, they simply highlight what we cannot know. Cousins (2014) emphasizes the
contingency of culture as the product of meaning-making.
When needs and goals change, then new meanings emerge
through the process of generating symbolic references between
signiﬁer and signiﬁed. Granted, the female cosmetic coalition
is not a static cultural entity, because it evolved, but the construct appears to deny agency to Pleistocene communities. They
seem to be trapped in a normative social and cosmological
structure that extends across time and space.
Why should, for example, evidence for pigment use in the
Acheulean of India undermine prediction (i) of the hypothesis, unless it is assumed that the coalition was an effectively
universal construct? Why should “suitably red and saturated
materials” be deemed the only acceptable evidence of ritual
based on pigment use when the archaeological (and ethnographic) record offers other materials (e.g., iron hydroxide and
manganese dioxide) and colors (e.g., yellow and black) that
could have conveyed meaning? A ground piece of iron hydroxide (yellow) is reported from excavation 6 at Wonderwerk
Cave but is suspected to have been a redder material that has
since weathered and changed its dominant color. Maybe so,
but similar hints at conﬁrmation bias are seen in the interpretation of scraped dolomite from Wonderwerk—one piece
produced a red powder and so might have been a source of
pigment, but another gave a light gray streak and a third produced a “dull brown” color. The latter two are dismissed as
pigment sources, because they are not red and the ﬁrst lacks
the staining power of a true pigment. As an aside, the presence
of scraped dolomite is of interest in its own right. These used
materials occur at a time of technological change with blade
making, prepared cores, and hafting as part of a much-expanded
behavioral repertoire. The scraped and gouged surfaces may be

Volume 57, Number 3, June 2016

part of this technological variability—abraders, perhaps, used
in blade core preparation or for grinding or rubbing other materials rather than or in addition to producing colored powders. The pigment selection criteria in place here deliberately
reduce the options for interpretation in favor of the preferred
theory and increase the “cost” of potential sources of pigment.
Knight (1991) long ago anticipated the sceptics’ charge that
mineral pigments might have other uses and so cannot be assumed to be primarily of symbolic value. That charge has
gained momentum in recent years as new analytical methods
have demonstrated the various qualities of red ochre as a preservative, sun block, and additive to adhesives used in hafting
(see summary in Rifkin et al. 2015). Now is the time to examine the properties of specularite in a similarly dispassionate
way. Perhaps this could be combined with the planned mineralogical analyses.
I agree with the authors and with Kuhn (2014) that mineralbased pigments represent the earliest durable evidence for
materials that could have been used for body painting. Body
painting, however, does not have to be linked with ritual to be
effective as a signal of identity. The number of pieces of pigment
reported here for the Fauresmith at both sites is small; do they
constitute the required “clear archaeological signature” of ritual?
I am not convinced, nor am I convinced of the association of the
one fragment of weathered hematite with late Acheulean at
Wonderwerk Cave. The authors are duly cautious in recognizing the uncertain provenance of this piece, but they still regard it
as the “best evidence” for pigment use in this context. On a more
general note, the presentation of the each site would have
beneﬁtted from section drawings to show the stratigraphic position of the pigment ﬁnds in relation to the archaeological industries.
I welcome the publication of this material from the Northern
Cape. The description and images add to a small but important
body of data on early mineral use in Africa. Their association
with the technological transition from the Acheulean to MSA
adds to what appears to be an expanded biocultural niche
evolving in the Middle Pleistocene (Barham 2013). Ritual may
have been part of that niche, but the evidence remains unconvincing.

Specularite, unlike ochre, is a pigment with no reported purpose other than visual display. The comparatively meagre literature on this pigment makes Watts, Chazan, and Wilkins’
contribution a most welcome addition. The authors are to

logical record, but also for reexamining contexts and dates of
previously reported specimens.
Specularite has been recovered from a range of predominantly MSA localities and some earlier sites. Unlike ochre
it is not necessarily easily identiﬁed, as its natural steel-grey
or bluish lustre belies its red color notation streak. Also, as
noted by the authors, there is no color code that captures
specularite’s unique glittery appearance. While it is the red
streak of specularite that is emphasized in this article, the
equally eye-catching steel grey or blue lustre of this pigment
should not be overlooked.
The attention-grabbing blue tint of specularite and its reﬂective and glittering nature, especially when applied to the
hair, was ﬁrst documented by nineteenth-century travellers
to southern Africa. The following examples illustrate the ease
of application and the outstanding visual effect. Burchell ([1822–
1824] 1953:256–257) describes specularite, or “sibilo,” as “a shining powdery iron-ore of a steel grey or bluish lustre and soft
and greasy to the touch, its particles adhering to the hands or
clothes, and staining them of a dark-red or ferruginous color.
The skin is not easily freed from these glossy particles, even
by repeated washing; and wherever this substance is used every
thing soon become contaminated, and its glittering nature betrays it on every article which the wearer handles. The mode
of preparing and using it, is simply grinding it together with
grease, and smearing it generally over the body, but chieﬂy
on the head; and the hair is often so much loaded and clotted
with an accumulation of it, that the clots exhibit the appearance of lumps of mineral. . . . Although the color of the
sibilo be a brownish red, yet the micaceous particles give it
a blueish tint in those places which reﬂect the light more
strongly . . . the exact color together with that peculiar glittering which it would impossible to imitate by any other means.”
Another traveller (Lichtenstein 1812:311) records an event
where a woman’s “hair was dressed with great care; it was divided into small bunches, which were well rubbed over with
the shining ointment, and hung down from the crown of the
head, looking like a profusion of silver thread or cord.” Finally, Methuen (1848:104) reported the use of specularite by
members of a tribe who “often smear their bodies with fat
and red ochre, and cover their hair with a paste consisting
of black lead-ore, called sibilo, till their heads shine with it
as if . . . they wore metal skull-caps.”
The value of specularite was perhaps enhanced by its rarity. As Burchell ([1822–1824] 1953]:256) notes, the glittering
ore is considered valuable and “constitutes in some degree
an article of barter with the more distant tribes . . . so that
the use of it extends over at least ﬁve degrees of latitude, or
among every tribe I visited.” These historical descriptions
strongly resemble the properties of specularite and the preparations for its use presented by the authors. Once specularite is ground and mixed with fat or grease, its application stains the body red, but when applied to the hair, it
renders the wearer not only a lustrous blue-gray but also eye-

303

catchingly brilliant. It appears likely that the MSA or late
Acheulean people using specularite were aware of these variant visual effects. Whether it was preferred for its red streak
or its blue metallic lustre, specularite produces a costly cosmetic, which, if used in the ﬁre-lit ritualized display suggested
for the back of Wonderwerk Cave, would certainly have been
attention grabbing.
A ﬁnal point can be made regarding the authors’ appeal
for further investigations “to assess the feasibility of ‘ﬁngerprinting’ archaeological and outcrop materials to address the
provenancing issues raised.” Initial attempts to geochemically ﬁngerprint specularite are encouraging (e.g., Kiehn et al.
2007; Smith and Fankhauser 2009). Once fully implemented,
this technique would also assist in resolving the inferred minimum transfer distances for the period between ~500 and
~300 Ka. Results of investigations using geochemical ﬁngerprinting for provenancing sources of silcrete (Nash et al. 2013a,
2013b, forthcoming) and obsidian (e.g., Ambrose 2012; Morgan
et al. 2009; Negash et al. 2007; Negash and Shackley 2006;
Vogel et al. 2006) are already essential in determining prehistoric mobility patterns and travel distances. Although these
studies have focused mainly on MSA raw material acquisition, the straight-line minimum transfer distances indicate a
common trend: ﬁngerprinting techniques frequently reveal
surprisingly long procurement distances. Determining transport distances for rare goods, such as specularite, from source
to site would provide crucial insights into the social networks
and behavioral practices of the later Acheulean of southern
Africa.

This article makes three main contentions. Based on a systematic examination of evidence for pigment use in South African
Pleistocene sites, the authors argue that the earliest reliable
evidence for intentional use of hematite pigment is associated
with Middle Pleistocene Fauresmith assemblages at several localities. They further assert that this use of hematite is part of
a complex of novel behavioral developments occurring in the
second half of the Middle Pleistocene. The third contention
concerns the evolutionary signiﬁcance of pigment use among
early hominins. Here, the authors promote a modiﬁed version
of the so-called “female cosmetic coalitions” (FCC) hypothesis, placing it in opposition to a recent suggestion (Kuhn 2014)
that early pigment use was part of low-cost “truthful” signaling systems.
I am not a geochemist, and I have no special knowledge
about what has been identiﬁed as hematite in various sites in
southern Africa. However, the authors’ systematic and repli-

cable analysis of the various specimens is welcome. Even the
most experienced archaeologist has learned over the years that
ﬁeld observations, whether about the nature of sediments or
the unusual materials found in them, are often misleading.
Techniques such as micromorphology and mass spectroscopy have demonstrated repeatedly that the sediments we dig
through and the mineral inclusions they contain are often not
at all what they ﬁrst appear to be. I also agree completely that
the Middle Pleistocene saw very signiﬁcant developments in
hominin technology, social behavior, and cognition, whether
in Africa or Eurasia. Increasing research focus on this pivotal
time period will only enrich our understanding of human behavioral evolution.
Not surprisingly, I ﬁnd the authors’s third contention a
good deal less compelling. First, they seem to go out of their
way to create an opposition between my recent article on
systems of ornamentation in the Paleolithic and the FCC. In
that article (Kuhn 2014), I claimed that pigments generally
do not express investment or cost as effectively as do media
such as beads. Following the lead of Maynard-Smith and Harper (2003), I argued that pigments were therefore better suited
for low-cost, honest signaling systems where sender and receiver have similar interests. In that sense, my article seems
to be consistent with the “coalition” part of the FCC. Here,
however, the authors claim that the hematite evidence from
southern Africa is more consistent with group rituals involving
costly signaling. How this articulates with the FCC hypothesis is
unclear; it is certainly not a necessary implication of the early
stages of the model. Furthermore, the authors’ claim is based on
three main assertions: that group ritual is inherently costly, that
some of the pigments used by Fauresmith people were selfevidently costly, and that these pigments were used in elaborate group rituals. None of these assertions is well supported.
Early in the article, the authors state that collective ritual is,
by its very nature, “extravagant and time consuming” and therefore always indicative of costly signaling, citing an article by
Sossis and Alcorta (2003). This is misleading. Sossis and Alcorta’s article is concerned speciﬁcally with explaining the development of rigorous and costly religious observances using
signaling theory. They claim, quite reasonably, that “Religious
behaviors often entail signiﬁcant proximate costs” (Sossis and
Alcorta 2003:264, emphasis mine) but make no contention that
all collective ritual, or all use of shared signals, is costly. There
are countless ways in which people use body ornamentation to
express group cohesion and solidarity that are anything but
time-consuming and extravagant. A familiar environment such
as a university campus is a virtual ocean of low-cost signals expressing group identity and social solidarity expressed in media such as T-shirts, temporary tattoos, make-up, and hairstyles. And every day, bearers of the signals organize themselves
through routine social rituals such as meetings, prayer groups,
and rallies.
As for the second assertion, I agree that, when procured from
a distant source (whether directly or through social connec-

Volume 57, Number 3, June 2016

tions), pigments can express costliness effectively. However,
here the Fauresmith evidence is equivocal at best. The authors
themselves state that the claim that pigments at Wonderwerk and Kanteen Kopje come comparatively distant sources
is “tentative” and unconﬁrmed. Moreover, we are talking about
a very few small pieces of specular hematite, not large quantities. It is by no means obvious that these materials would
have effectively communicated exoticness or cost to viewers.
And what about the elaborate ritual in which the specular
hematite was used? Hematite from Wonderwerk comes from
a dark part of the cave, where there is also evidence for ﬁre.
From this the authors imagine the existence of a “ﬁre-lit ritualized display, capable, in principle, of grounding shared ﬁctions.” Of course, “ﬁre-lit ritualized display” need not be elaborate or costly. Moreover, these same deposits also contain
stone artifacts, including manufacture waste, as well as other
sorts of humdrum debris. Were these also part of the ritual?
I admit that I ﬁnd it difﬁcult to understand why hominins
chose to light ﬁres and conduct other activities in the dark
recesses of Wonderwerk. However, there are many possible
reasons for being there beyond creating a stage for elaborate
and costly rituals. It is interesting that earlier deposits at the
site, also “deep inside” the cave, contain traces of ﬁre and domestic debris (Berna et al. 2012) but no evidence of hematite
use.
In comparing the potentials of pigments and objects such
as beads as signaling media, I have probably underestimated
the potential of pigments. Clearly, there is a good deal more
to be learned about the performance characteristics of various forms of “information technology.” I also admit to not
giving much space to the FCC, mainly because I was (and still
am) uncertain about how it would work. And I would not be
shocked if we eventually ﬁnd evidence for costly signaling in
material culture predating the Upper Paleolithic. However, the
case made here for early use of hematite as evidence for costly
signals and elaborate social rituals in the Fauresmith is poorly
supported and unconvincing.

Because pigments appear critical for understanding the emergence of symbolic behaviors in the Middle Pleistocene, detailed documentation of this South African material is invaluable. The authors make several signiﬁcant contributions, ﬁrst,
in analyzing remains of possibly the earliest symbolic traditions
of humankind—a collection of probable early pigment materials reported previously without substantiating detail. Second, their interdisciplinary stance draws on both classic social
anthropology and modern evolutionary ecology to theorize

Early Evidence for Brilliant Ritualized Display

the role of this material in ritual performance. Third, they test
competing models from a signal evolution paradigm on speciﬁc hypotheses about the social uses of this material as part
of a general picture of major social developments in the midMiddle Pleistocene.
The analysis yields a picture of pigments appearing in Fauresmith levels with little evidence for prior usage in the Acheulean. Fortunately, this cluster of sites in the Northern Cape
provides us with clear messages. Glittery specularite is unambiguously used for display and not for any functional alternative. There are other colorants (yellow ochre and manganese) that are readily available, supporting deﬁnite selection
of glittering and dark red materials. The special context of
Wonderwerk makes it hard to imagine anything but some
form of ritualized display in the gloomy cave. Transport distances inferred for specularite to Wonderwerk (~50 km) and
especially Canteen Kopje (170 km) indicate the value set on
this material by archaic humans.
The archaeological analysis therefore offers grounds for
quite speciﬁc interpretations. While these are bound to appear
speculative, the models being used, female cosmetic coalitions
(FCC; Power 2009) and cheap-but-honest ritual coordination
(Kuhn 2014), are theoretically constrained and, in principle,
offer competing predictions. Both are premised in signal evolution theory, the main branch of behavioral ecology for understanding animal communication. The process of ritualization
in animal signaling provides a certain continuity with emerging
ritual performance in human culture and has been implicated
in models for religion and symbolism by scholars across disciplines (Alcorta and Sosis 2005; Boyer 1994:189, 222; Deacon
1997:379–384; Huxley 1966; Power 2009, 2014; Rappaport
1999; Rossano 2015).
The FCC model sees sexual selection and sexual conﬂict over
levels of investment in large-brained offspring as the driving
force, stressing costly signaling. By contrast, the cheap-buthonest model assumes small-scale rituals coordinating egalitarian groups with no signiﬁcant conﬂicts of interest, hence
lower costs. But transport distances of specularite challenge
the notion of “cheap” here.
FCC is intimately linked to the timetable of increasing brain
size in the fossil record, because mothers experienced reproductive stress as brains increased in volume, requiring increased
investment by males. Hence this hypothesis would be falsiﬁed
by any signiﬁcant pigment record prior to H. heidelbergensis
encephalization 700–800 Ka. The Wonderwerk sequence running from Early Stone Age Acheulean into Fauresmith offers a
good test.
The cheap-but-honest hypothesis is silent about particular color or display media, whereas FCC foregrounds choice
of blood reds. Females who mount a strong coalition in resistance to advances of noninvesting males—visibly demonstrated through ritual cosmetic performance—should be attractive to discriminating investor males, who are willing to
do bride service to get sexual access. So, FCC is linked directly

305

to home base strategies (females and their kin do not follow
the hunt but demand that the proceeds come to them) and to
increasing productivity of hunting. Again, the models compete on which comes ﬁrst: ritual produces the social conditions generating home bases (FCC) or homebase strategies
imply coresidential groups with aligned interests who need
small-scale ritual to keep them coordinated (cheap-but-honest
signaling). The latter suggests there could be a time lag in use
of pigments relative to home bases, but that is challenged by
present evidence.
Mithen (1999), Kuhn and Stiner (2007), Henshilwood and
Dubreuil (2009), and others have questioned whether body
painting is, in itself, “symbolic,” while Watts (2009) and Power
(2010) have argued along Durkheim’s lines that body-painted
dance and performance is the necessary and sufﬁcient step into
a symbolically demarcated world. Nonhuman animals perform
coalitionary ritualized display, so we need to carefully distinguish the special features of human ritual.
At issue are shared or sociocentric ﬁctions, which have no
place in nonhuman ritualized display. The nonhuman world
consists in “brute facts.” Institutional reality—our world—is
made up of objective facts that depend on subjective belief
(Searle 1995). Only through collective intentionality can a symbolic relationship that X stands for Y be agreed and effected.
Durkheim taught us a century ago that ritual alone can generate
such we-intentionality.
No great ape apart from ourselves ever begins to add paint
to their faces or bodies. To intentionally add, or have added
by another, design or color to oneself is to play with something “fake” which can only have value if the intention is shared
with someone who joins in that game. As people become
marked with identities that are collectively agreed and ﬁctive,
an individual is no longer just herself; she has created an intersubjective representation of herself for others, experiencing
herself as others see her. For humans, there really can be no
such thing as purely individualistic display. Self-decoration
displays the individual in relation to the enduring social group
to which she belongs. Cosmetic display, through ritual performance and collective intention, constitutes the social group
beyond the here and now.
If we do have evidence of symbolic capacity and performance
in the period from 500–300 Ka, the question becomes, why did
it take so long subsequently to establish full-scale symbolic
culture? The authors hint at speciﬁc local conditions and demographic factors which might engender a pioneering symbolic
enclave at these early dates. We need to consider the ratchet
effect of cultural transmission and accumulation among small
populations. FCC argues that sexual selection will act as a stabilizing force, but intensiﬁcation and regularization of the
emergent ritual cosmetic strategy is expected in relation to increases of brain size (and concomitant female reproductive
stress). Because the ﬁnal stage of encephalization in the lineage
of modern Homo sapiens occurs after 300 Ka, FCC predicts
pigment usage to spread and stabilize after that date.

We are very grateful to all the commentators. Sheila Coulson
draws attention to the regional ethnohistorical record of specularite use, emphasizing its visual properties, restriction to displays, and high esteem. We add that the most frequently recorded
ritual context of use was the treatment of adolescent initiates
(male and female) on their emergence from seclusion (Engelbrecht 1936:160–61, 167; Moffat 1842:250–251; Willoughby
1909:242). We would also correct a misapprehension: we drew
attention to specularite’s dark, glittery properties, addressing
whether these contradicted the FCC’s predicted focus on reds.
Camilla Power expands on the FCC hypothesis, stressing
that “we-intentionality” and sociocentric ﬁctions distinguish
human ritual from nonhuman counterparts, that classic social anthropological theory provides a secure foundation for
Searle’s philosophy of the symbolic, and that the behavioral
ecology of signaling allows us to chart a route from nonhuman ritual to “we intentionality.”
We were particularly gratiﬁed by the measured tone of
Kuhn’s comments. Readers could be forgiven for thinking
we had an ax to grind with Kuhn’s hypothesis. Far from it;
informed by the most relevant body of theory, we consider
this hypothesis the most signiﬁcant contribution to the interpretation of early pigments in over a decade.
Nevertheless, fundamental disagreement remains about
early group ritual. In common with ritualized signals in general, characteristic traits of group ritual include ampliﬁed,
stereotyped, redundant display, traits more indicative of signaller sales pitch and receiver sales resistance than shared
interest (Krebs and Dawkins 1984). In this context, we treated
early group ritual as “extravagent”—having evolved through a
competitive arms race, in contrast to the “conspiratorial
whispering” predicted of cooperative signals. Not all religious
behaviors are costly, but Sosis and Alcorta are unequivocal
that “communal participation in costly ritual” is one of four
“cross-culturally recurrent features of all religions” (Alcorta
and Sosis 2005:325). Modelling the variability of these costs
in given social contexts does not remove the centrality of cost
for establishing group commitment in the ﬁrst place.
Secondary disagreements include the following. First, we
were not discussing “a very few small pieces.” For Kathu Pan,
we provided streak data for 28 pieces. For the 16 weighed pieces
in table 1, from all three sites, average weight (5SD) was
47:9  47:6 g), more than for any MSA assemblages (Watts
2002, table 1). More importantly, Kathu, Wonderwerk, and
Twin Rivers show repeated specularite use over long periods.
Second, the evidence for ﬁre “deep inside” Wonderwerk Cave
at ~1 Ma concerned excavation of a naturally well-lit zone,
not comparable to the very gloomy conditions of excavation 6.
Despite this evidence, it is not thought that Wonderwerk
served as a base camp at this period (Chazan 2015).
Kuhn points out that the early stage of the FCC model
does not predict exotic procurement. There may be grounds for

Volume 57, Number 3, June 2016

confusion here. We treated all three sites as providing early
evidence for pigment use (between ~500 and ~300 Ka)—evidence consistent with local procurement associated with the
oldest dating estimates—at Kathu, where the high quality of
local materials gave no grounds for anticipating change. The
tentative evidence for regional or exotic procurement at Wonderwerk and Canteen Kopje appears to fall at the younger end
of the temporal range.
Barham’s criticisms are that we wittingly or unwittingly
brought a conﬁrmation bias to our research; that the FCC
hypothesis draws on ethnographic support, but this only
highlights something that cannot be known about the deep
past; and that the hypothesis traps agents in “normative
sociological and cosmological structures” extending across
time and space.
Having identiﬁed what we considered a signiﬁcant behavioral pattern (earlier pigment use than generally presumed,
correlating with a suite of important behavioral changes), we
wanted to promote discussion about the interpretation of this
pattern. Drawing on theoretically informed models generating
refutable predictions is standard procedure. The important issue
is not whether we, or the lead author, had another “agenda,” but
whether readers can distinguish between purported testing and
conﬁrmation bias. Popperian falsiﬁability remains a fair criterion for whether a proposition is scientiﬁcally grounded. The
attraction of investigating some of the pigment predictions of
the FCC hypothesis in the Northern Cape was that the region
offered the opportunity to refute its ﬁrst prediction, that pigment use should not predate early Middle Pleistocene brain
size increase. Beaumont and Bednarik (2013) claimed that, at
Wonderwerk, pigment use extends back ~1.1 Ma. The color
selection prediction could potentially be refuted, because yellow
ochre and black manganese were locally available at Wonderwerk and Kathu, respectively.
Are we engaging in conﬁrmation bias when suggesting
that the ground piece of “iron hydroxide” at Wonderwerk may
have been redder at deposition? This piece provided a hue of
Y50R (table 1), brown rather than red or yellow. We provided
observations to support the inference of some postdepositional
hydration. We should also have noted that there is localized
evidence for standing water during the deposition of the excavation 6 sediments (Chazan and Horwitz 2009:530, citing unpublished observations by P. Goldberg). The other cited cases
of possible conﬁrmation bias are the three scraped, weathered
dolomite with poor or no staining power. Given the brain’s neurological biases (Deacon 1997), there is no compelling reason
for thinking that the dull brown and grey powders of two of
the pieces were used for signalling. Classifying the case from excavation 1 as pigment would add ~300,000 years to the behavior,
solely on the basis of powder production. We were trying to
avoid such poorly warranted inferences. As for the red specimen,
most analysts would probably have classiﬁed this as pigment;
we withheld deﬁnitive judgement because of our caution concerning the other two pieces, and because poor staining power
contradicted one of our guiding criteria. We agree that this

Early Evidence for Brilliant Ritualized Display

leaves unanswered what purpose(s) weathered dolomite powder served, an interesting research project beyond the scope
of this article.
Far from revealing a conﬁrmation bias on our part, we think
Barham’s comments reﬂect his own view, based on his analysis of Twin Rivers, that a wide color palette was employed in
the early MSA (2002:188). Although widely repeated (d’Errico
et al. 2003:4, 2008:169; Wadley 2005:2, 2009:166), this view has
been criticized as an overinterpretation of the available data
(Watts 2010, supplementary online material, pp. 13–19). Barham misrepresents us as claiming that only “suitably red and
saturated materials” provide “acceptable evidence” of ritual use
of pigments. Our main ﬁnding was the repeated use of dark,
glittery specularite, alongside the collection and use of redder
forms of hematite; we pointed out that other, locally available
colors were ignored. Globally, only one site testiﬁes to yellow
pigment use in the Middle Pleistocene, also providing the only
reasonable evidence for a black pigment in this epoch (van Peer
et al. 2004). Yellow and black pigments are essentially Upper
Pleistocene phenomena, while the latest research on Neanderthal
use of black manganese suggests it was more likely used as a ﬁre
lighter (Heyes et al. 2016). Black and yellow could have conveyed
meaning; the pertinent question is why they scarcely seem to
have done so for the ﬁrst 400,000 years of earth pigment use.
The FCC hypothesis does not posit female coalitions as a
“universal construct.” It proposes that they may have arisen
wherever later Homo mothers experienced the energetic burdens of further encephalization (qualiﬁed by the degree of birth
seasonality, a natural constraint on male philandering; see Power
et al. 2013), so the hypothesis is indeed potentially applicable to
all daughter lineages of H. heidelbergensis (sensu Stringer 2012).
This is why we noted that Hunsgi could also potentially refute
the hypothesis’s ﬁrst prediction.
Regarding the role of “ethnographic support,” the FCC
hypothesis was developed on Darwinian theoretical grounds,
not as a model based on ethnographic analogy, but a model
of the origin of symbolic culture needs symbolic data to test
it. The hypothesis generated expectations concerning the dynamics of ethnographic cosmetic usage (Power 1999:102). Literature reviews of Bushman use of pigments and dyes indicated
that cosmetics were primarily used in ritual contexts, red pigments being used most consistently in girls’ menarcheal rituals
(Knight et al. 1995; Watts 1999), a ﬁnding fully consistent with
the model. Initiation rituals, whether male or female, are central
to cultural transmission among all hunter-gatherers. Social
anthropologists have long been identifying some kind of “blood
symbolism” at the core of symbolic culture, invariably invoking
menstrual blood (Durkheim 1897; correspondence of George
Frazer to Henry Jackson, 1887, in Fraser 1990:74–80; Knight
1991; Testart 1986). Archaeology alone cannot support the interpretative load of the FCC hypothesis, but the hypothesis
distributes that load across evolutionary theory, archaeology, and
ethnography.
This leads to the most intriguing issue raised by Barham,
that the FCC hypothesis denies human agency by positing

307

normative cosmological structures across space and time.
The hypothesis does claim such structures, but at the level of
an underlying syntax to the mobilization of ritual power
rather than at the level of historically contingent meaning.
We agree with Cousins (2014) and Barham that people had
to keep their signiﬁers relevant to changing needs and goals.
What Barham omits is that such a process was guided by
prior understandings of adaptive demands (Cousins 2014:185),
analogous to “descent with modiﬁcation.” Religion, mythology,
and fairy tales are deeply conservative at the level of formal
structure (Lévi-Strauss 1970; see also da Silva and Tehrani
2016). For anyone familiar with the syntactical, ethnographic
predictions of the FCC hypothesis, we draw attention to
southern Setswana historical practice, where the key ritual
events of boys’ initiation, from circumcision and smearing
with red ochre, to the adornment with specularite at reintegration, were all timed to occur at the new moon (Willoughby
1909:233–234, 242). As so often where men monopolize paramount forms of ritual power, they (secretly) acknowledge that
this was a power stolen from women (Knight 1991:451–452;
Willoughby 1909:229).
