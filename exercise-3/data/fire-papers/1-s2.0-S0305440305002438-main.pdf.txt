Abstract
In the cover sand area of the NW European plain very little is known about fireplaces within Mesolithic settlement areas. Yet the frequent
occurrence of burnt ecofacts (hazelnut shells and bone) and artefacts (flint and quartzite) clearly indicates the presence of (surface) hearths on
nearly every campsite. Most of these hearths are non-structured and are thus barely visible in the soil. Furthermore in most spatial studies minimal effort has been made to locate these ‘invisible’ hearths as accurately as possible. This paper discusses the potential and modalities of detailed spatial analysis of burnt artefacts and ecofacts, using recently obtained archaeological and experimental evidences. It is concluded that
such an analysis can offer interesting insights into the dynamics of Mesolithic hearths.

1. Introduction
Compared to the Late and Final Palaeolithic phases, structured surface hearths from the Mesolithic period are very rare
in Western Europe, in particular in the cover sand area of the
NW European plain. Only few campsites have yielded stonebuilt hearths, e.g. Gramari [29], Ruffey/Choisey [33], Rottenburg [23,24], Nab Head II [17], Remouchamps [19] or sand
and/or loam/clay modulated hearths, e.g. Ulkestrup [1], Barmose [20], Duvensee [6,8e11], Doel [13], etc. Yet the recurrent presence of burnt lithic artefacts, sometimes in large
numbers, clearly proves that fireplaces were built on most if
not all Mesolithic sites that so far have been excavated. The
scarcity of constructed hearths can be explained by the nonavailability of stone in the immediate environment of the
campsites, the short use-time of Mesolithic hearths (and settlements), particular soil conditions (wet versus dry sites), etc. It

thus seems that on most Mesolithic sites situated on dry mineral soil, e.g. on cover sand deposits, simple surface hearths
were the most common feature.
During excavations, the archaeological visibility of these
simple hearths is much lower compared to stone-built ones,
for example. Generally post-depositional processes such as
soil formation and bioturbation erase most, if not all traces.
In cover sand deposits, for example, the formation of a heather
podzol generally has led to a total blurring of features situated
in the top parts of the soil. Furthermore most Mesolithic sites
have lain on the surface for long periods, some never covered
by younger sediments, and hence all charcoal remains
have disappeared from the surface hearths as a result of
long-term wind exposure and rain/frost weathering. Only
more resistant and compact organic material, such as burnt
bone remains or carbonised seeds and nut shells, survives
these conditions. In addition, due to the absence or the low
amounts of iron in most sandy soils, the burning of a fire usually did not lead to a reddening of the soil (‘rubéfaction’) [26,
p. 217 and 241].

and the outline of non-structured surface hearths at Mesolithic
sites [26] so far have not been very successful. For the time
being it seems that detailed spatial analysis of burnt artefacts
and ecofacts remains the best way to obtain relevant spatial information on these hearths. Unfortunately, in most spatial
studies of Mesolithic sites little attention has been paid to
these categories of finds. If hearths are invisible, they are
very often defined arbitrarily, e.g. by drawing a rough circle
around the highest density of burnt artefacts (e.g. [33]). On
the other hand, on sites with structured surface hearths almost
no detailed research is done on the relationship between the
hearth and the different categories of burnt artefacts (e.g. Duvensee 13 [11, p. 19]; Choisey/Ruffey [33]).
This paper describes a method for the spatial analysis of
burnt items so that former hearths can be more accurately located within Mesolithic and older habitation sites.
The approach discussed is based on experimental data
which have been compared and tested with the spatial data
from the extensively excavated Early Mesolithic site of Verrebroek ‘‘Dok 1’’ [14,16,34].

2. The archaeological record: the Early Mesolithic
site of Verrebroek ‘Dok 1’
From 1992 to 2000 large rescue excavations conducted by
Ghent University took place at Verrebroek ‘Dok 1’, situated in
NW Belgium. Due to the lack of time the site was excavated in
squares of 0.25 m2 and 10 cm layers, which were wet-sieved
over meshes of 2 mm. The excavations revealed at least 55
(mainly) Early Mesolithic artefact concentrations spread
over a surface of about 6000 m2. Most concentrations were
spatially well-preserved thanks to a peat and clay covering
on the Mesolithic surface, which was laid down at around
3780e3100 cal. BC at its earliest. Unfortunately the saturation
of the landscape began too late for organic material to be preserved. Hence the concentrations consist almost exclusively of
lithic finds (flint and quartzites) e between 135 and 45,288 artefacts (larger than 1 cm) and chips per concentration e supplemented with a very limited number of stone artefacts
(mostly sandstone), charred hazelnut shells and small, heavily
burnt bone fragments [34]. Generally these concentrations are
in surface of less than 30 m2 (most are even smaller than
20 m2) although larger concentrations also occur (maximum
86.5 m2). The small size of the concentrations, the low amount
of tool evidence, the limited activity spectrum [4], all point to
relatively short-term occupations.
Within most concentrations high to very high percentages
(30e75%) of burnt lithic artefacts are reported, which clearly
point to the presence of former fireplaces. Unfortunately direct
traces of the latter have not been preserved in the soil, a consequence of the posterior formation of a heather podzol (Boreal/
Atlantic), the low Fe amount of the parent soil material [26,
p. 217 and 241] and the relatively late covering of the site.
The total amount of burnt artefacts in the small concentrations
(in areas of less than 30 m2) is very variable, fluctuating
between 13.3 and 73.3% (Table 1a), while the large

concentrations (in areas of more than 45 m2) generally hold
more than 40% of burnt lithic material (Table 1b).
The burnt items can be further subdivided into several
classes on the basis of the degree of fire damage. In view of
a spatial analysis a distinction was made between weakly-,
moderately- and heavily- (overheated) burnt artefacts. Weaklyburnt artefacts show hardly any traces of heat damage, except
for a weak reddish shine and a few isolated cracks. Moderately
burnt artefacts have more visible heat damage, such as pot-lid
fractures, cracks and colour changes, while a white to grey
discolouration as a result of a total dehydration is the characteristic of heavily burnt or overheated artefacts.
Spatial analysis showed that there is a close coincidence in
the spatial distribution of the different categories of burnt
items. Generally the distribution of burnt artefacts covers the
entire surface of the lithic concentrations. However, this distribution is not homogenous: in most concentrations a clear and
dense clustering can be observed in or near the centre.
Except one, all analysed concentrations yielded charred hazelnut shells (Table 1). Generally the quantity fluctuates between 0.28 and 169.1 g (average 30.17 g). Two large
concentrations (C70 and C22) deviate clearly with 623.26
and 2887.02 g. In most cases there is a fairly close spatial coincidence between the burnt hazelnut shells and the highest
density of burnt lithic material (Fig. 1). Exceptions are both
concentrations which yielded substantial amounts of hazelnut
shells (C22 and C70): these show several smaller clusters of
hazelnut shells situated at maximum a few metres away
from the centrally located highest density of burnt lithic artefacts (which contains less charred hazelnut shells). Also remarkable is the presence of two pits e respectively, S80
within C22 (with a depth of 60 cm) and S89 within C70
(with a depth of 48 cm) e with a high quantity of charred hazelnut shells in the periphery of both concentrations. These
pits are interpreted as either hazelnut storage pits [15] or
tree-fall features [26].
All analysed concentrations, except four, contain a very low
quantity (between 0.01 and 17 g) of small fragments of heavily
burnt bone (Table 1). Three concentrations (C22, C70 and
C72) stand out with 45.88, 54.1 and 92.04 g, respectively.
The spatial coincidence with the distribution of the (heavily)
burnt lithic artefacts is even more encouraging than in the
case of the hazelnut shells (Fig. 1).
3. The experiments
In view of a better understanding of the distribution pattern
of burnt artefacts and ecofacts at Verrebroek some experiments
were carried out in 2002. The experimental research was restricted to the burning of flint [34]. The aim of the experiments
was threefold. We wanted to investigate the ‘natural’ scattering
of lithic artefacts that had been thrown into an open fire. A second research goal concerned the measurement of the radiant
heat of an open fire in order to quantify its impact on surrounding artefacts. A last question was related to the effects of
smouldering charcoal (e.g. from a cleaned-up hearth) on lithic
material.

The experimental artefacts were made of fine-grained Tertiary gravel from Oudenaarde (province of East Flanders, Belgium). All experimental hearths were built on a flat, sandy
(cover sand) surface without vegetation. The hearths consisted
of a basal layer of small twigs of Pinus, covered by branches
of Pinus which were laid in ray formation (diameter ca.
70 cm). Pinus was chosen because analysis of charcoal from
the Verrebroek site had indicated that it had been the main
fuel for the fires [3].
A first experiment consisted of throwing an experimental
lithic assemblage into a camp fire (Fig. 2). Approximately
1 h after extinguishing, the hearth and its immediate surrounding (18 m2) were excavated in the same way as the Early
Mesolithic concentrations of Verrebroek ‘‘Dok 1’’, i.e. in
squares of 0.25 m2 and sieved over meshes of 2 mm. Subsequent spatial analysis indicated a specific distribution pattern.
The heavily burnt artefacts were found nearly exclusively
within the limits of the hearth itself while the weakly and
moderately burnt artefacts (mostly chips) occurred within
the hearth as well as outside it (Table 2, Fig. 3). The latter
were distributed asymmetrically around the hearth, with the
largest clustering along the W-NW side of it. During the experiment it was observed that quite soon after having been
thrown into the fire small splinters (mainly pot-lids) of the
artefacts were ejected from the hearth, as far as 2.5e3 m
away.

The second experiment consisted of placing an unbroken
line of artefacts starting from the surface hearth to the surrounding area. During heating the temperature of the artefacts
was taken with an infrared thermometer. From this experiment
it became clear that only those artefacts which were in direct
contact with the fire were heated to a temperature above
300  C and showed heat damage. Artefacts lying outside the
hearth, even those immediately bordering the hearth, were
not affected by the heat at all. This is explained by the fact
that immediately outside the hearth the temperature drops
drastically.
The third experiment, in which smouldering charcoal (from
an extinguished experimental surface hearth) was scattered
over an assemblage of lithic artefacts, led to similar observations. The largest charcoal lumps had a temperature of maximum 300  C, which was insufficient to cause heat damage
to the artefacts.
These experiments also clarified a few other things. It became clear that the Tertiary gravel used showed signs of
heat damage at only around 300  C, which is in accordance
with the findings of other authors (cf. [30]). This boundary
is very abrupt: the critical point is probably in the order of
less than 10  C because artefacts exposed to temperatures of
280e290  C do not show traces of heat damage. Colour
changes occurring beneath 300  C as established in experiments on ‘Havelte’ flint [30] or on Southern German flint

and chert [31,18] were not observed. Tests with primary flint
from Harmignies (Belgium) gave similar results to our experiments. A second important observation from the first experiment is the strong fragmentation of the artefacts caused by

burning. After this experiment the initial 143 artefacts (larger
than 1 cm) and 530 chips were shattered to 240 artefacts (larger
than 1 cm) and 3419 chips, i.e. a multiplication with factor 1.7
and 6.45.

artefacts outside the hearth.

4. Discussion
From the above experiments it has become clear that
severely burnt/overheated artefacts are the best indicators of
the position of former non-structured surface hearths. The
experiments showed that in normal conditions overheated artefacts can only be found inside the limits of the hearth itself.
At Verrebroek ‘‘Dok 1’’, however, none of the excavated
concentrations yielded a pattern comparable with the experiments. In the areas of small and large concentrations the
overheated artefacts were widely distributed. Generally the
distribution covers almost the entire surface of the concentration. Hence it may be concluded that most burnt items
clearly are no longer in place. In other words the former fireplaces within the artefact concentrations of Verrebroek have

been affected by additional activities or processes than
burning.
One of these activities may have been the cleaning out of
hearths and re-laying for using again. This type of activity is
well-known from numerous Late Magdalenian sites in France,
e.g. at Pincevent, Verberie and Etiolles [21]. At these sites
hearth-cleaning resulted in the formation of ‘hearth-dumps’,
consisting of small but dense accumulations of usually small
burnt artefacts and ecofacts, sometimes mixed with fragments
of burnt soil. It is important to note that these dumps are always found well away from the hearth-area. At the French
Magdalenian sites these are usually situated at 4e7 m outside
the concentration. At Verrebroek ‘‘Dok 1’’, on the other hand,
the highest density of overheated artefacts and ecofacts is usually found in the centre of the artefact concentration, a position

incompatible with the hypothesis of hearth-dump. Rather,
these central clusters of overheated artefacts should be interpreted as the remains of former surface hearths. This idea is
further supported by the recurrent pattern in the distribution
of specific artefact types around these central clusters, which
points to a certain degree of functional organisation. Flintknapping posts, indicated by small clusters of unburnt chips,
almost always border these central hearths, whereas unburnt
scrapers generally cluster to the west-northwest of the hearths.
Another recurrent pattern is the spatial distinction between artefacts used for processing plants and those used for skin preparation [4]. Both categories of tools are usually found on
opposite sides of the hearth. Furthermore, small concentrations
possess a clear forward and backward toss zone while large
concentrations have a certain degree of size sorting. All these
patterns are consistent with the interpretation of the artefact
concentrations at Verrebroek ‘‘Dok 1’’ being the remains of
former living (dwellings?) and activity areas organised around
a more or less central fireplace.
The fact that these behavioural patterns are still preserved
also proves that post-depositional processes, such as animal
activity (e.g. wild boars grubbing the settlement after the human occupation) cannot be held responsible for the displacement of overheated artefacts outside the hearths. It seems
more likely that the dispersal of overheated artefacts occurred
during the occupation of the loci as a result of, e.g. foot traffic,
extinguishing of the hearth by strewing or scuffing the ash,
manipulation during food preparation or other domestic activities, or simple clearing by sweeping [35].
Based on these findings it is possible to work out a protocol
for the spatial analysis of Mesolithic living-floors showing no
traces of structural features. A first step would be to locate the
surface hearth approximately using the square units with the
highest density of overheated artefacts. Based on the generally
small dimensions of structured hearths (Fig. 4), we would

propose to limit the surface of the reconstructed hearth to
1 m2, i.e. four spatially connected 1⁄4 m2. A second step would
be the analysis of the spatial distribution of the burnt artefacts,
eventually for each category separately (weakly, moderately

and heavily), around the reconstructed hearth. At Verrebroek,
for example, a clear distinction could be observed between the
small and large concentrations. The potential hearths of small
concentrations lie clearly asymmetrical within the overall distribution of the burnt artefacts while the hearths of the large
concentrations are situated centrally (Fig. 5). We presume
that the morphology and size of the distribution patterns are
connected with the intensity of distortion/cleaning/sweeping
activities and thus might be indirectly related with the duration
of the occupation.
A next step concerns the spatial analysis of specific artefact
types or artefacts with a similar function in view of a reconstruction of the former organisation of the area around the hearth, the
hearthzone. Traditionally, this type of exercise is done without
distinction between burnt and unburnt artefacts. However, if it
assumed that all overheated artefacts, including tools, situated
outside the presumed hearth have been displaced, these should
be excluded from further spatial analysis as they reflect secondary depositions which might distort the original functional layout of the living-floor. At best the spatial analysis should be
done separately for the burnt and unburnt items.
A last remark concerns the extremely high frequency of
burnt artefacts retrieved from numerous concentrations at Verrebroek, a pattern which is found at nearly all Mesolithic sites
in NW Europe and which contrasts sharply with Late Palaeolithic sites. Although at Verrebroek most knapping sites are situated in the immediate vicinity of a hearth, it seems very
unlikely that all artefacts fell in the fire by accident during
the knapping. Several knapping experiments [2,5,28] revealed
that a seated person creates a high density scatter of lithic
waste of barely 0.5 m2 situated inside a low density area of
1 m2. In addition, from experience we have observed that
a seated person always has to keep a (comfortable) distance

of at least 0.5 m to the hearth. From these two observations
it can be deduced that only a very small quantity of artefacts
(mostly chips) could have ended accidentally in the fire during
the knapping and that at least part of the burnt lithic material
must have been tossed or kicked in the hearth deliberately or
by accident.
The same is probably true for the burnt ecofacts found in
association with the presumed surface hearths at Verrebroek.
It is commonly assumed that surface hearths were used for
preparing all kinds of food (domestic hearths), hence the organic remains found in these hearths have been interpreted
as food remains which fell into the fire during cooking. Burnt
hazelnut shells, for example, are usually considered as indications of nut roasting [7]. Roasting generally produces large
quantities of charred hazelnut shells: from experiments executed
by Score and Mithen [32] it has become clear that even under
ideal circumstances (i.e. in a roasting pit with a depth of 10 cm
and a roasting time of 1.5 h) 20e25% of the nuts are charred
and thus useless for consumption. At Verrebroek, however,
only a few hearths yielded large quantities of burnt hazelnut
shells; from the 27 analysed lithic concentrations so far, 15
possess less than 19 g of carbonised hazelnut shells. Converted, this means that at maximum 44 nuts were charred
and 132e176 nuts (or 132e176 g kernels) were properly
roasted and thus useful for consumption [27]. Was it worth
roasting such small quantities of nuts? The calorific value of
176 hazelnuts is less than 1234 kcal [12] which is 61.7% of
the daily calorie needs for one person (generally 2000 kcal
per day is used as a basic adult requirement; for discussion
see [22]). An alternative explanation might be that the nut
shells were not the remains from roasting but had simply
been thrown into the fire after consumption, directly or during
the process of cleaning up the hearth.

rather point to the processing of garbage or recycling of waste
as fuel than at cooking activities.

The combination of detailed spatial analysis and goaloriented experiments has led to new insights into the spatial
dynamics of lithic artefacts found in a non-structured hearth.
It has been demonstrated that simple surface hearths can be localised quite accurately on the basis of the distribution of severely burnt or overheated chips (2 mme1 cm) or burnt bone
fragments. Moreover, some insight was gained for Mesolithic
hearth treatments. Apparently the Mesolithic hearths of Verrebroek ‘Dok 1’ were the subject of strong dynamics. Different
artefact types (lithic material, bones, hazelnut shells) were deliberately thrown into the hearth, and, once the hearth was
(more or less) extinguished, the hearth experienced e even
in very small, short-lived concentrations e clear manipulations
resulting in the horizontal diffusion of numerous burnt artefacts over the entire living-floor. On the basis of this observation it is strongly recommended for spatial analysis of
Mesolithic sites to analyse the distribution of burnt (secondary
dumps) and non-burnt artefacts (potential primary dumps)
separately.

Fig. 5. Distribution of weakly/moderately (hatched) and heavy (grey) burnt artefacts (10 min/0.25 m2) in a small concentration, i.e. C16 (above) and a large
concentration, i.e. C70 (below). The position of the presumed hearth is marked
with a black square.

Two concentrations (C22 and C70A) with a considerable
amount of hazelnut shells are obvious exceptions and qualify,
in our opinion, as evidence of roasting. Where this took place e
in or nearby the hearths e is not clear. Yet it is remarkable
that in the periphery of both concentrations a pit was found
with a high quantity of charred hazelnut shells. These pits
are too deep for roasting hazelnuts under ideal circumstances
[32]; probably they had another function, for example to store
the roasted nuts.
Likewise we considerably doubt that the small bone fragments collected from several surface hearths at Verrebroek
are the direct result of cooking activities (accidental loss during roasting). Cooking activities demand temperatures of
250  C at maximum [25 (p. 46),36], which is much too low
to calcinate bone. Calcination requires temperatures of
