Tortoises are one of the most common faunal components at many Palaeolithic archaeological sites
across the Old World. They provide protein, fat, and other ‘animal’ resources in a ‘collectable’ package.
However, for most sites their interpretation as human food debris is based only on association, rather
than demonstrated through taphonomic analysis. Because of their very different anatomical conﬁguration compared to mammals, it is difﬁcult to conduct such analyses by directly applying the taphonomic
methods used to interpret large mammal assemblages. Tortoise-speciﬁc taphonomic analysis is presented here for the Still Bay layers at the important Middle Stone Age (MSA) site of Blombos Cave (BBC),
Western Cape, South Africa. Research on MSA subsistence systems at sites such as BBC has almost
exclusively relied on analysis of large ungulate remains, in spite of the fact that many of these key sites
contain equal or greater numbers of tortoise fragments. In this analysis we show that human modiﬁcation is common on the BBC tortoises, and that there are consistent patterns of fragmentation and
burning that indicate set processing sequences including cooking while in the shell, hammerstone
percussion, and human chewing of limbs. The almost exclusive dominance of the angulate tortoise,
Chersina angulata, is conﬁrmed by full skeletal element analyses rather than only counts of single elements such as humeri. The sex distribution can be reconstructed for this species, and is female-biased.
For all tortoise assemblages, taxonomic and skeletal element abundance data should be calculated
from a sample of complete elements, or at minimum the entoplastron and humerus. A sample of shell
and limb/girdle elements should also be subjected to microscopic bone surface modiﬁcation analysis, as
modiﬁcations are often rare or subtle but highly informative. Using this approach, analysis of breakage
patterns, bone surface modiﬁcation, and burning patterns can be understood together to speciﬁcally
reconstruct tortoise collection, processing, and human dietary signiﬁcance across a range of archaeological sites.

1. Introduction
1.1. Overview
Tortoise remains are common at Palaeolithic sites across the Old
World. Where they are assumed to represent human food refuse
they have formed the basis of studies examining diet breadth,
palaeodemography, and subsistence (Blasco and Fernández Peris,
2012a; b; Stiner et al., 2000, 1999). However, only a few studies
have directly addressed the issue of tortoise taphonomy (Blasco,
2008; Sampson, 2000; Speth and Tchernov, 2002). Much work

has been done on understanding how larger mammals are captured
and processed, but there are no established ways of presenting
taphonomic data from tortoises. Although basic zooarchaeological
methods of data collection and analysis will be applicable, the
unique anatomy of tortoises suggests that processing patterns e
and their archaeological traces e should be very different to that of
mammals.
1.2. Tortoises in the South African record
In South Africa, tortoise remains are found in archaeological
deposits ranging from Middle Pleistocene to historic sites (CruzUribe and Schrire, 1991; Klein et al., 1999). They are common in
both Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA) sites in the
Western Cape, for example reaching densities of 49e304

individuals/m3 at the LSA site of Byneskranskop (BNK) and 3e18
individuals/m3 at the LSA/MSA site of Die Kelders Cave 1 (DK1)
(Cruz-Uribe and Schrire, 1991). Several MSA sites in the Western
Cape of South Africa, such as Ysterfontein 1 (YFT1), DK1, Boomplaas
Cave (BPA), Diepkloof Rock Shelter (DRS) and BBC have produced
large tortoise assemblages but these have only been studied in
terms of basic counts of individuals and body size comparisons,
with emphasis on their palaeodemographic and palaeoenvironmental implications (Faith, 2011; Henshilwood et al.,
2001b; Klein et al., 2004; Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 2000; Steele and
Klein, 2013).
Most of these studies have assumed that humans preyed on
tortoises and that the remains were accumulated at living sites
(Henshilwood et al., 2001b; Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1983, 1987,
2000). At DK1 Klein and Cruz-Uribe (2000:190) conclude that
because tortoise numbers in both the LSA and MSA layers are
inversely correlated with the (presumably non-anthropogenic)
abundances of Cape dune molerats (Bathyergus suillus), “.people
almost certainly introduced most of the tortoises in both units”. At
BBC tortoises were assumed to be the result of human predation
because of the overall association of the faunal assemblage with
artefacts, the degree of charring on faunal specimens, and the lack
of macroscopically-visible carnivore damage (Henshilwood et al.,
2001b).
The smaller tortoise assemblage from Pinnacle Point Cave 13B
(PP13B) is the only MSA assemblage that has been studied using
microscopic taphonomic methods, and for which full NISP and MNI
counts are available for both limb and shell elements (Thompson,
2010). This study found that hominin modiﬁcation such as cut
marks for deﬂeshing, percussion marks for opening the shell, and
preferential burning patterns from cooking were all rare but present on the assemblage, and in different proportions than similar
damage on large mammal bones. This raised the possibility that
tortoises underwent speciﬁc modes of processing quite different
from mammals, and so should have different fragmentation and
bone surface modiﬁcation patterns. One way to test this hypothesis

is to conduct the same analysis on a larger tortoise assemblage from
BBC, which is a site that has comparably-collected taphonomic data
from the large mammals (Thompson and Henshilwood, 2011).
1.3. Background to Blombos Cave
BBC is located on the southern coast of South Africa, approximately 300 km east of Cape Town (Fig. 1). Excavations between
1992 and 2009 uncovered a stratiﬁed sequence of LSA and MSA
deposits (Henshilwood, 2008; Henshilwood et al., 2009, 2001b).
The MSA levels at Blombos Cave are divided into four phases, M1,
upper M2, lower M2 and M3. These have been dated using thermoluminescence (TL), optically stimulated luminescence (OSL),
electron spin resonance (ESR) and thorium/uranium to between ca.
75 to >130 ka (Henshilwood et al., 2002, 2011; Jacobs et al., 2003a,
2013, 2003b, 2006, 2013, 2003b; Jones, 2001; Tribolo, 2003; Tribolo
et al., 2006). Summaries of the chronology of the BBC deposits, their
associated ages, and material culture are provided in Table 1 and
Fig. 2.
BBC has played an important role in establishing that complex
material culture and the expression of symbolic behaviour was
present in Africa by at least 100 ka (Henshilwood, 2009;
Henshilwood et al., 2009, 2011). The upper two phases at BBC
contain Still Bay points (Mourre et al., 2010; Villa et al., 2009), bone
tools (d’Errico and Henshilwood, 2007; Henshilwood et al., 2001a;
Henshilwood and Sealy, 1997), engraved ochres (Henshilwood
et al., 2009, 2002), and perforated Nassarius kraussianus shell
beads (d’Errico et al., 2005; Henshilwood et al., 2004). The ochres
and beads have been regarded as primary evidence for modern
cognitive and symbolic behaviour (Henshilwood, 2009; Vanhaeren
et al., 2013). The lowest phase (M3) coincides with the high sealevel stand during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5c, and contains
basin shaped hearths, abundant ochre (some engraved), some ﬁsh
remains, high frequencies of shellﬁsh, and an ochre-processing
workshop (Henshilwood, 2012; Henshilwood, 2009; Henshilwood
et al., 2011; Henshilwood et al., 2001b).

The taxonomic composition of the BBC MSA faunal remains has
been previously reported by Henshilwood et al. (2001b) and
taphonomic work has been reported by Thompson and
Henshilwood (2011). Bovids dominate the large mammal sample,
with small size 1 ungulates such as grysbok/steenbok (Raphicerus
spp.) very common in the M3 and Upper/Lower M2 phases but with
more representation of larger ungulates in the M1 phase. Carnivores are rare, which suggests that prolonged carnivore denning
did not take place (Cruz-Uribe, 1991; Pickering, 2002). Across ungulate body size classes, MSA people are implicated as the primary
accumulators, with perhaps slightly less human input of small
ungulates in the lowermost M3 phase (Thompson and
Henshilwood, 2011).
A central line of enquiry concerning the emergence of modern
human behaviour is how changes in human behaviour may have
been reﬂected in or perhaps even facilitated by changes in diet,
subsistence, and foraging efﬁcacy (Dusseldorp, 2010; Faith, 2008;
Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1996; Marean et al., 2007). The BBC ﬁnds
support the early use of marine resources recorded at other MSA
sites along the southern Cape coastline (Klein et al., 2004; Marean
et al., 2007; Wurz, 2012). However, many unaddressed issues
remain; for example the actual dietary contribution of the tortoises
represented by the large quantities of their fossils found at sites
such as BBC.
1.4. Ecology of the angulate tortoise
Southern Africa has the world’s richest diversity of terrestrial
chelonians (Branch, 1984; Ramsay et al., 2002). At least one
palaeontological lair site in the Western Cape documents the
presence of several chelonian species during the Late Pleistocene
(Peterhans and Singer, 2006), whereas at other non-anthropogenic
sites chelonians are extremely rare or not reported in taxonomic

detail (Klein, 1975; Rector and Reed, 2010). Despite this, almost all
tortoises that have been reported from MSA sites are Chersina
angulata, the angulate tortoise (Faith, 2011; Henshilwood et al.,
2001b; Kandel and Conard, 2012; Klein et al., 2004; Klein and
Cruz-Uribe, 2000; Steele and Klein, 2013; Thompson, 2010). This
is a small to medium tortoise not exceeding 250e300 mm in
maximum length (Branch, 1984; Hofmeyr, 2009; van Heezik et al.,
1994). It is currently distributed throughout southwestern South
Africa and southwestern Namibia (Fig. 1). They tolerate a broad
range of habitats and are found in all major ﬂoral biomes of South
Africa (Boycott and Bourquin, 1988; Joshua et al., 2010).
The species is monotypic and sexually dimorphic, with males
slightly larger than females (Berry and Shine, 1980; Branch, 1984)
and little morphological variation across its geographic distribution
(Van Den Berg and Baard, 1994). The sex ratio in wild populations
from two study areas has been near 1:1, with a preponderance of
adults in the population (Branch, 1984; van Heezik et al., 1994).
Most growth occurs within the ﬁrst ten years of an individual’s
lifespan, which likely lasts about 25 years (Branch, 1984). Males are
signiﬁcantly more active than females during the summer and
spring (Keswick et al., 2006; Ramsay et al., 2002), when most
ﬁghting and courtship occurs. By the time the tortoise has achieved
an age of about 7e8 years and a weight of approximately 300 g, or
125 mm in total length males exhibit signiﬁcant morphological
differences from females (Branch, 1984). The most prominent
sexually dimorphic feature likely to preserve archaeologically is the
projecting unpaired gular scute (Mann et al., 2006), manifested
skeletally as paired elongated epiplastra bones.
Potential predators for the angulate tortoise are each expected
to accumulate and modify remains in a way that can be separated
from human processing and consumption. Black eagles (Aquila
verreauxii) have been known to drop tortoises from a height
(Boshoff et al., 1991; Steyn, 1884), and accumulations of tortoise

bone occur under raptor roosts (Sampson, 2000). The kelp gull
(Larus dominicanus) does the same, accumulating smaller tortoises
up to approximately 130 g (Branch and Els, 1990). Snakes such as
the Cape cobra (Naja nivea) may prey on juvenile angulate tortoises
(Haacke et al., 1993). Chacma baboons (Papio cynocephalus ursinus)
observed at De Hoop Nature Reserve are unable to open larger
tortoises, but do prey on smaller individuals (Hill, 1999). All of these
agents would be expected to accumulate mainly small tortoises or
strictly limb and head elements from larger tortoises, with evidence of ingestion in the form of gastric etching and punctures
from beaks, talons, and teeth on the bones (Lloveras et al., 2009).
Bushﬁres also pose substantial risk to tortoise populations (Avery
et al., 2004; Stuart and Meakin, 1983), and this may have been
taken advantage of by MSA collectors.
Although no longer common within the geographic distribution
of angulate tortoises today, larger African mammalian predators
were also potential tortoise accumulators in the Western Cape in
the past. Analogies can be made to the hingeback tortoise (Kinixys
spekii) in Zimbabwe, which has a large number of mammalian and
avian predators. Predation rates have been shown to be very high
on this tortoise, which is a smaller tortoise that reaches maximum
lengths of between 130 and 140 mm (Coulson and Hailey, 2001). In
the Western Cape, brown hyenas were likely important accumulators and modiﬁers of angulate tortoises (Avery et al., 2004;
Peterhans and Singer, 2006; Rector and Reed, 2010).
2. Material and methods
2.1. Data collection and entry
Taphonomic (including microscopy), taxonomic, and skeletal
element abundance (SEA) data were collected from a sample of the
top level (CA/NA) of the M1 (Still Bay) phase, which is present
across the site. Because all elements were examined in detail, the
sample was by necessity smaller than that reported from the 1992,
1997, 1998, and 1999 excavation seasons, and which included only

humeri (Henshilwood et al., 2001b). Specimens received individual
records in the database even if the speciﬁc bone in the sequence
could not be identiﬁed. Specimens that could only be identiﬁed
generically as “carapace or plastron” and that were <1 cm in
maximum length were bulk recorded and bagged together, without
individual records or microscopic study in either phase. Epiplastra
were sexed morphologically and more complete specimens were
measured to obtain a basic area estimate of the triangle formed by
the epiplastron tip. This area was hypothesised to be larger in males
because of their larger body size and the additional projection of
their gulars. The M3 phase was sub-sampled to provide SEA data
from its top portion (levels CH/CI) for comparative purposes, but a
full study of the M3 sample (including microscopy and bulk analysis) fell outside the scope of the present work, which focuses on
the Still Bay deposits.
2.2. Taxonomic and skeletal element abundances
A modern skeletal collection was used to identify each specimen
to taxonomic afﬁnity, element, and side. The normal conﬁguration
is provided in Fig. 3. Apart from the neurals, it is typically possible
to tell from where in the shell (which bone and which bone number) any given complete bone derives. Skeletal element abundances
were evaluated using the Number of Identiﬁed Specimens (NISP)
and the Minimum Number of Elements (MNE); the highest count
on the latter provided the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI).
The fraction-summation approach was a time-effective and accurate means of estimating the MNE and MNI for most elements
(Marean et al., 2001). This approach entails recording the fraction of
a given element that a specimen represents, for example if 50% is
present than 0.5 is noted in the record. Then all element fractions
are summed to obtain the MNE. This approach is highly effective for
tortoises because their elements fragment in consistent portions
and at consistent landmarks compared to mammals, and are
frequently nearly complete. Thus, it was not necessary to determine
the MNE using the visual overlap method or its digital derivative

(Marean et al., 2001) for each individual element, which can be
time-consuming (Lyman, 2008).
Conjoining was performed on the M1 sample, which also
assisted with sexing, as it allowed greater conﬁdence in estimations
of plastron concavity and allowed bones conjoined to the diagnostic epiplastra to be sexed. Tortoises are relatively simple to
conjoin, particularly in the plastron where bones are thick, preserve
in a relatively complete state, and there are only 9 elements. Conjoining sets of tortoise bone were digitally photographed from at
least two different aspects, and unlike individual elements these
conjoins were drawn as shape ﬁles into ArcGIS following protocols

adapted from Marean et al. (2001) and Abe et al. (2002). This
provided a visual rather than simply a tabular record of the conjoins, and allowed the spatial distribution of burning across multiple elements to be recorded more objectively.
2.3. Fragmentation and burning
Specimens were determined as being either complete or broken.
Broken specimens had the fracture type speciﬁed as either a fresh
(excavation) or postdepositional (old) break. The percentage present of the complete specimen was also recorded, as this was the

basis for the fraction-summation for MNE analysis. The MNE presented here is the highest count on that element type, not that
speciﬁc individual element within its row and side. For example,
there are 22 marginals e 11 on each side e and MNE data were
calculated for each, then the highest number taken as the MNE for
all marginals.
A maximum burning stage was recorded from each specimen,
on a scale of 0e6, with 0 representing an unburned specimen and 6
representing a fully calcined specimen. Different methods of tortoise preparation, including cooking in the shell, should result in
differential burning patterns. It was therefore recorded if burning
was located on the interior of the shell, the exterior, or both. It was
noted during conjoining that burning patterns often continued
from one element to the next, clearly indicating that heating had
taken place while the specimens were connected to one another. To
better understand these burning patterns they were also drawn
into ArcGIS.
The excellent preservation of the BBC fossils (typically pale
brown or light tan) made colour a ready attribute for recording
burning patterns. The intensity of burning was recorded for each
polygon drawn onto the template as either 0 (not present), 1 (present but unburned), 2 (slightly discoloured or with other evidence of
burning such as light peeling or charcoal ﬂecking), 3 (discoloured
and with a slight texture change from being heated), 4 (carbonised),
and 5 (calcined). The polygons were then summed to provide an
overall map of burning intensity across the shell. The burning intensity map represented where elements of the shell had been most
commonly and intensely burned, but the map would be affected by
differential skeletal part representation. For example, if a place on
the carapace was burned, but that location was only represented
once in the assemblage, then the burning intensity would appear to
be very low. An MNE map of the conjoins was therefore also
generated following Marean et al. (2001), and divided into the
burning intensity map using the raster math function in ArcGIS. This
changed the value of each pixel so that the map represented burning
intensity at each location on the shell divided by the number of
times that speciﬁc location was present in the assemblage.
2.4. Bone surface modiﬁcation
Each fragment in the M1 sample was examined under a 10e40
binocular zoom light microscope with a ﬁbre-optic halogen light
shining obliquely across the bone surface following Blumenschine
et al. (1996). Although microscopic taphonomic methods of bone
surface modiﬁcation analysis have been well-developed for large
mammal assemblages, the only similar-aged sites with comparable
treatment are PP13B in South Africa (Thompson, 2010) and Bolomor Cave in Spain (Blasco, 2008) e both of which have much
smaller assemblages than BBC. In addition to examining each surface for hominin modiﬁcation, the microscopic work allowed
detailed recording of taphonomic data such as surface weathering,
trampling, and geochemical alteration (Behrensmeyer, 1978;
Domínguez-Rodrigo, 2009; Thompson, 2005), rodent gnawing,
and gastric etching (Lyman, 1994). Marks were identiﬁed based on
descriptions and photographs in this body of literature but also on
the senior author’s experience with fossil assemblages and with
experimental cut-, percussion-, tooth-, and trample-marked assemblages. The majority of this research has been done on
mammalian bone, so identiﬁcation of modiﬁcations were conservative and only high-conﬁdence marks are presented here.
2.5. Details of the sample
The total sample (M1 and M3) comprised 9686 specimens, with
5846 larger than 1 cm and thus receiving an individual record. Of

these, 4817 were from M1 and 1029 were from M3. A total of 1197
specimens were conjoined from M1, comprising 311 conjoining
units. Of the conjoining units, 296 included at least one element
conjoined to another along a suture rather than a break. 213 conjoins were from the carapace, three from limb and head elements,
and the remainder were plastral elements. The largest number of
components to any conjoining unit was 26.
3. Results
3.1. Taxonomic and skeletal element abundances
Within the sample, 3191 specimens could be conﬁdently identiﬁed to taxon. Of the identiﬁable specimens, 3190 were Chersina
angulata and one was from the leopard tortoise Geochelone pardalis.
It is reasonable then to assume that the vast majority of nonidentiﬁed specimens may also be assigned to Chersina. This
assignment also gains conﬁdence by the substantial size difference
between the two species, the fact that tortoises and aquatic turtles
have different shell textures, and the ready differentiation of most
elements between Homopus (the pancake tortoise) and Chersina.
This result ﬁts well with previous reports of taxonomic representation performed only using humeri (Henshilwood et al., 2001b).
From the M1 phase a total NISP of 70 could be assigned to females and 50 to males. Counts on epiplastra in this phase provide
MNE data that show the same pattern: an MNE of 17 females versus
10 males. Fisher’s Exact Test shows that there is no signiﬁcant
difference in the sex ratio obtained using the NISP or the MNE
(p ¼ 0.83). Of the 164 epiplastra preserved in the M1 sample, 103
were sufﬁciently complete for measurement. As a total sample
there is only a single mode in the data, which are right-skewed,
suggesting a female-biased sex distribution and the inclusion of a
few very large males. When the morphologically sexed epiplastra
are separated the males are clearly larger, and the majority of
specimens classed as “ambiguous” fall towards the female end of
the distribution (Fig. 4). A KruskalleWallis test conﬁrms that there
are signiﬁcant differences in the median sizes between the male
and female datasets, and between the male and ambiguous datasets (Hc ¼ 10.31; p ¼ 0.006), further suggesting that many of the
ambiguous specimens are females.
The NISP and MNE data (Table 2) show that elements within the
carapace and plastron are differentially preserved. Limb and girdle
elements are poorly represented compared to shell elements, and
cranial and pedal elements are barely present. The entoplastron
provides the highest MNE count overall and an MNI of 80 tortoises
for both the M1 and M3 samples combined. Within individual
phases, BBC M1 yielded a total MNI of 74 (on the entoplastron) and
BBC M3 yielded a total MNI of 14 (on the humerus). The layers from
which the M1 and M3 samples derived were widely separated, and
there is minimal evidence for stratigraphic mixing between phases
at BBC (Henshilwood, 2005). Therefore, the total sample studied
here represents at least 88 individual tortoises.
3.2. Fragmentation
The plastron, which is thicker, was much less fragmented than
the carapace and most often broken along the ‘arms’ that extend
from the hypo- and hyoplastra and connect to the 4the7th marginals. This join is likely one of the weakest places on the tortoise
carapace and plastron. Limb and girdle elements were frequently
complete or simply broken into halves or thirds, unlike mammal
long bones (Table 3). A comparison of all summed carapace and
plastron elements to all summed girdle and limb elements shows
that signiﬁcantly more complete specimens from the shell are
found in the M1 phase than the M3 phase (p < 0.0001).

3.3. Burning
Detailed burning data are available for the M1 sample only
(N ¼ 4343). Sampson (2000) indicates that human-accumulated
tortoise assemblages should have an incidence of burning between 30 and 40%. Charring in the M1 phase is even higher than
this, at 66.1%. Speth and Tchernov (2002), Thompson (2010), and
Blasco (2008) all suggest that if tortoises were cooked whole on the
ﬁre, they should exhibit more charring on the exterior portion of
their shell than the interior. If most burning was post-depositional
rather than related to cooking, then it should be randomly
distributed. 59.3% of all burned specimens were burned on the
outside only, 38.9% were burned on both the outside and the inside,
and only 1.8% were burned on the inside only. The carapace was
more commonly burned than the plastron, and the limbs more
commonly burned than girdle elements (Table 5). In addition,
several of the carapace and plastron specimens were burned only in
speciﬁc and consistent locations (Fig. 6), which map onto what
would be predicted for tortoises subjected to burning carapace side
down in the complete shell.
3.4. Bone surface modiﬁcation

Another measure of fragmentation is the relationship between
the NISP and the MNE (Lyman, 2008). The ratio of NISP: MNE is
provided in Table 4. For paired or numbered elements, the NISP was
ﬁrst divided by the number of times that element occurs in the
skeleton to compensate for the way the MNE was presented. The
almost 1:1 relationship between NISP and MNE in the M1 sample
suggests very low levels of fragmentation. This is in contrast to both
the mammal data and the assertion by Henshilwood et al.
(2001b:435) that, “The tortoise sample comprises mainly small
fragments of carapace and plastron”. In fact, these elements are
frequently complete or nearly-complete and have simply become
disassociated from one another. However, there is relatively more
fragmentation in all elements (including limbs) in the M3 phase.
The relationship is not as strong between NISP and MNE, and the
datapoints are more widely scattered (Fig. 5).

impossible, and should be interpreted as values of 1.00. They are an artefact of the
compensation procedure described in the text.

Surface modiﬁcation was readily visible on the BBC tortoises.
95.4% of all specimens had at least half of their surfaces visible, and
85.7% of all specimens had their complete surface visible. 99.3% of
all specimens had surfaces that were not badly exfoliated, unlike
some of the larger mammal specimens from BBC (Thompson and
Henshilwood, 2011). 99.8% did not have any dendritic etching
that might be indicative of roots, fungus, or other bioerosion.
Manganese ‘ﬂowers’ were observed on some surfaces, diagnosed
under the microscope as structurally different from burned
patches.
98.4% of the specimens had no evidence of being smoothed or
polished. For those that did, the damage may be from carnivores or
people licking or sucking the bone and in these cases should be
associated with other damage such as tooth marks, crushing, or
gastric etching. In a few rare cases some abrasion occurred well
after the nutrient extraction phase, after the scutes had worn away
and exposed the underlying bone (see Inline Supplementary
Fig. S1).
Inline Supplementary Fig. S1 can be found online at http://dx.
doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2013.08.017.
The incidence of diagnostic bone surface modiﬁcations that
occur during the nutritive phase is provided in Table 6. Gastric
etching overall occurred on 2.6% of the assemblage. As a proportion
of overall skeletal representation in the same sample there were
many more gastrically-etched limb and girdle elements (6.6%) than
carapace/plastron elements (2.2%). This difference is highly significant (p < 0.0001) using Fisher’s Exact Test. Tooth marks occur on
all elements, but proportions were higher for limb elements than
other skeletal part categories. They were second highest on girdle
elements and also occur on the carapace and plastron (often along
fracture edges). Tooth marks came in a variety of different forms,
such that it was not possible to establish a direct relationship between tooth mark abundances and carnivore activity, as is often
assumed for larger mammal assemblages.
Fig. 7a, b, c, and d show damage to tortoise fossils at BBC that
suggest human consumption. The tooth marks were associated
with crushing and peeling of the bone, with small, overlapping,
bunodont (not punctured) depressions. This damage typically
occurred along the margins of smaller carapace or plastron fragments, and on the ends of limb or girdle elements. Many of the
incomplete limb or girdle elements had ends that were chewed
away, rather than simply snapped or broken off. This type of

222

damage was often associated with polishing or smoothing of the
fracture edge. Several authors have described such marks left by
human mastication on mammalian bone (Landt, 2007; Lupo and
Schmitt, 2005; Pickering and Wallis, 1997; White, 1992), and
Blasco (2008) has also identiﬁed human chewing on tortoise fragments from Bolomor Cave. Only sixteen marked specimens listed in
Table 6 could be conﬁdently assigned as carnivore damage. The
remainder more closely resembled human damage because the
damage comprised generalised crushing rather than individual
marks and drags, but it should be cautioned that such damage can
be ambiguous.
Tooth marks ascribed to non-human activity (Fig. 7 e, f, g, and h)
came in the form of small parallel scratches, deeper subparallel
grooves with a sharp margin for tooth entry, and large punctures,
usually along the margins of bones. Two fragments exhibited small,
triangular marks indicative of raptor beak marks (Sanders et al.,
2003), and these are not included in Table 6. This is possible even
at sites where no obvious raptor roosts are apparent, as some raptors (particularly the spotted eagle owl, Bubo africanus) will roost on
the ground as well as in roof cavities (Fry et al., 1988; Reed, 2005).
All stone tool cut marks occurred either on the inside of the shell
or on limb elements (Fig. 8), with most on the interior of the
carapace. Hammerstone percussion marks occurred on the exterior
of the shell only, usually in association with a crack or fracture edge
(Fig. 9). It was not expected that they would be common, given that
while the tortoise still retains some nutritive value the shell is
covered in tough scute material. Bevelled fracture edges on the
interior of the shell also occurred, and this has been taken as an
indication of percussion that may preserve even without corresponding percussion marks (Blasco, 2008).

71.8% of all percussion marks occurred on carapace elements,
19.7% on the plastron, and the remainder on non-identiﬁable
fragments. Most of the percussion marks on the carapace
occurred on the marginals and costals, although this could be
partially because these elements are more common the skeleton
overall. It is noteworthy that approximately half (47%) of all percussion marks on marginals were on bone numbers 4e7, which are
those identiﬁed as being at a weak point where the carapace joins
the plastron.
4. Discussion
4.1. Agent(s) of collection and modiﬁcation
The majority of complete skeletal elements derived from adult
tortoises, based on both their size and bone surface texture. It is
difﬁcult to quantify the population age structure of tortoises at BBC
based on available published data, which only measure humerus
size (Henshilwood et al., 2001b). Ecologists have noted several tight
allometric relationships between various parts of living tortoises
(Branch, 1984), but unfortunately those that can be measured
skeletally (for example complete carapace length) require complete
tortoises. The BBC tortoise elements were disarticulated to such a
degree as to make this unfeasible, but future work with modern
tortoises will allow humerus size data to be translated into absolute
estimates of tortoise size. This will establish cut-offs that would
eliminate all tortoise predators except humans and larger
mammalian carnivores.

In the absence of these data, this discussion will focus on
taxonomic representation, skeletal element abundance, and bone
surface modiﬁcation. The assemblage is effectively monotaxic, with
fewer male than female Chersina at a ratio of 1:1.4 (by NISP) or 1:1.7
(by MNI). In extant populations the sex ratio has been 1:1.17 and
1:1.18 in favour of males over an 11-year study period for one area
(van Heezik et al., 1994), and 1:1.2 in favour of females in another
(Branch, 1984). The bias in favour of females in M1 may account for
the smaller overall tortoise size in this phase observed by
Henshilwood et al. (2001b).
Sampson (2000) has shown that raptors preferentially drop
limb, girdle, and skull elements relative to shell elements. However,
Fig. 10 shows that the BBC data are instead dominated by carapace
and plastron elements. A closer look shows that each of the

distributions is signiﬁcantly different from the other (M1 versus
M3: Ch2 ¼ 3468.7, DF ¼ 2, P < 0.0001; M3 versus VFT: Ch2 ¼ 846.69,
DF ¼ 2; M1 versus VFT: Ch2 ¼ 60,419, DF ¼ 2, P < 0.0001), implying
signiﬁcant variability between shell and limb/girdle representation.
There are relatively more limb and girdle elements present in the
M3 phase than the Still Bay M1 phase. This could imply more raptor
input into the assemblage during M3 times.
However, differential fragmentation between shell and limb/
girdle elements in each of the phases may lead to overrepresentation of one element class relative to another. The intensity of fragmentation has a large part in determining how
identiﬁable a given specimen is to a particular element, which then
controls the threshold at which MNE data can be reliably calculated
and understood relative to NISP (Lyman, 2008). In the context of
BBC it is also important because mammal bones were found to be
less fragmented in the M3 phase (Thompson and Henshilwood,
2011), suggesting that there was an increased intensity of human
occupation, trampling, and burning in the more recent phases at
the site. In this case, it was found that during the M3 phase tortoise
limb and girdle elements were more fragmented relative to carapace and plastron elements than during the M1 phase. These factors account for the relatively high proportions of limbs/girdles
during the M3 phase using the NISP, but the MNE data still suggest
that further microscopic study is needed to fully assess whether it
was differences in human processing strategies and site use or
slight differences in the accumulator that best explain variability
between phases.

Comparisons of skeletal element abundances between the two
phases also have some important lessons about which tortoise elements to use to calculate MNE and MNI data. The entoplastron
provided an MNI of 74 for M1, whereas the humerus only provided
a count of 24. In contrast, the humerus provided the highest MNE
count in the M3 phase (14), while the entoplastron only provided a
count of 5. A very tight correlation between NISP and MNE was
found for M1, but the M3 data were not as closely correlated and
girdle elements in particular deviated from the trend because they
were more highly fragmented. This suggests that different taphonomic processes may render samples from different contexts
incomparable if only a single element or element class is used in
MNE and MNI calculations. The abundance of the entoplastron in
the M1 phase highlights the value of this element as a robust bone
that is likely to preserve in a whole state, be easily identiﬁed and
counted, and not require siding. These factors make it a good
candidate for quickly evaluating plastron representation at a site
relative to limb representation, which can be done using the humerus or femur.
There is a large body of literature on how diagnostic marks such
as cut, percussion, and tooth marks are manifested and preserved
under a variety of experimental conditions (Blumenschine et al.,
1996). However, there are no comparative experimental models
for how tortoise bone retains surface modiﬁcations compared to
mammal bone. Most of the nutrients in a tortoise are on the inside
of a hard skeleton, whereas most of the nutrients on mammals are
on the outside. It is therefore quite likely that the unique anatomy

and bone structure of tortoises also means that chelonian consumption will have a very different signature from large mammal
consumption.
In spite of this, there is abundant evidence from the surface
modiﬁcation analysis that the tortoises at BBC were predominantly,
if not exclusively, collected and processed by MSA people. Particularly in the case of the Still Bay sample, all major forms of hominin
modiﬁcation are present, and in some cases abundant: preferential
burning throughout the skeleton, percussion marks, bevelled internal fracture edges, human tooth marks, cut marks on limb elements, and scrape marks on the internal portions of the carapace
and plastron. The differential placement of these modiﬁcations is as

informative as their simple presence, and this also allows for a
reconstruction of how the tortoises were processed.
4.2. Tortoise processing strategies
Of the 80 entoplastra represented in the sample, 32 were parts
of conjoining units ein most cases as part of a substantial conjoining unit of three or more individual bones. This speaks to a
considerable level of integrity within the plastron. This, together
with the placement of the entoplastron in the centre of the
plastron indicates that the tortoises were brought to the site
complete.

Fig. 10. Proportions of shell and limb elements present at BBC by NISP and by MNE. Note that only identiﬁable elements are included, so as to make the data comparable to
Sampson’s (2000) data from the raptor accumulation at Volstruisfontein (VFT).

Differential burning throughout the skeleton indicates tortoises
were burned while they were still complete. Burning was signiﬁcantly more common on the exterior than the interior of the shell,
more common on the carapace than the plastron, and it followed a
distinctive pattern around the shell that suggested the most heat
was delivered to the top, margins, and where the limbs of the
tortoise emerge. Limbs were burned more commonly than girdle
elements. This pattern is consistent with what would be expected if
the tortoise was placed upside down in the ﬁre, as has been
documented ethnographically and archaeologically around the
world (Blasco, 2008; Sampson, 2000; Schneider and Everson, 1989;
Speth and Tchernov, 2002).
Avery et al. (2004) report that tortoises killed in sweeping
bushﬁres do not exhibit much charring on the bone. In contrast,
tortoises burned in a campﬁre should be exposed to prolonged and
direct heating. Furthermore, the shell was often broken in areas
with the most intense burning. This may have been a postdepositional result of increased bone brittleness or MSA people
may have purposefully heated tortoises to the point that their shells
became brittle and easier to access (Stiner et al., 1995).
The presence of cut marks on the limbs and scrape marks on the
interior of the carapace and plastron indicate that stone tools were
used to facilitate butchery in different ways. Tools were used occasionally to disarticulate limbs and scrape meat from inside the
shell e though actualistic work is still required to determine how
frequently such marks are left. Human chewing and tooth marks on
the limbs and around the margins of the shell indicate direct consumption with limited used of stone tools in comparison with large
mammal remains, where stone tools left large quantities of
butchery marks (Thompson and Henshilwood, 2011). Finally, the
presence of percussion marks restricted to the exterior of the shell
indicates that hammerstone percussion was used to open the
shell e likely at the weakest point along the side of the carapace.
A likely sequence of processing is that the tortoise was ﬁrst
placed upside down in the ﬁre. After removal any limbs that had
become charred were either twisted or cut off and chewed. The
tortoise was placed on its side on an anvil and struck with a
hammerstone. The meat was then consumed, with stone tools used
as needed to scrape remaining meat from inside. After the girdle
elements were consumed, they and the entire tortoise were discarded. In many cases they were likely thrown back onto the ﬁre, to
account for the burning observed on both the interior and exterior
of the shell.
Indigenous people at the Cape have been recorded using tortoise
shells as drinking receptacles and storage containers. This extract is
from the journal, dated 1673, of Wilhelm ten Rhyne (Schapera and
Farrington, 1933:121): “They do sometimes use cups.or the shells

of tortoises which they have eaten”. In the ca. 2 ka LSA levels at
Blombos Cave a carapace of the turtle Pelomedusa subrufa showed
evidence of scrape marks on the interior and grinding on the edges
suggest its use as a bowl, possibly to store or mix ochre, as both the
edges and inner surface were ochre stained (Henshilwood, 2008).
Worked tortoise carapaces are reported from LSA levels at Uniondale
in the Eastern Cape (Brooker, 1989) and Nelson Bay Cave in the
southern Cape (Inskeep,1987), but there is no evidence of the tortoise
shells examined macro- or microscopically from the MSA levels at
BBC being worked or used as containers. Similarly, no such evidence
has been reported for other MSA sites. It is possible that at BBC the
potential value of the shells as containers in the MSA was lessened by
extensive burning. This, combined with the butchery mark data,
show that during Still Bay times tortoise processing for food was both
consistent and common. It is therefore important to consider how
signiﬁcant tortoises may have actually been as food sources.
4.3. Tortoises as nutritional packages
Tortoises are effectively a protein and fat package available in
collectable form. Studies of different species of tortoise show that
fat content ranges between about 2% and up to 13% (Kienzle et al.,
2006; Lapid et al., 2005; Pearse et al., 1925), but most chelonians do
not have masses of dissectible fat (Pond, 1978). These data suggest
that tortoises have similar percentages of fat relative to lean meat
as wild ungulates (Crawford et al., 1970, 2010; Skinner and Louw,
1996; van Zyl and Ferreira, 2004). An average-sized adult Chersina
weighs about 860 g (van Heezik et al., 1994). The shells of tortoises
comprise approximately one-third of total body weight (Kienzle
et al., 2006), and the estimated gross caloric yield for a Chersina is
ca. 3332 kJ/796 kcal (Thompson and Henshilwood, 2013).
Although the overall caloric return of ungulates is higher than
for tortoises, there are many beneﬁts to tortoise consumption.
Hunted ungulates have many search and handling costs, while
technological costs of tortoise processing are negligible. Time and
energy investment could be made in searching for tortoises, but a
more efﬁcient method would be to simply collect them opportunistically as they are encountered. Encounter rates could also be
increased by intentionally foraging for other resources in areas that
are known to also contain tortoises. This would then mean that the
only investments are in carrying and processing them: both minimally expensive tasks in terms of both caloric and time expenditure. In this sense they differ from other small prey (Bright et al.,
2002) or mobile prey (Bird et al., 2009), which incur signiﬁcant
handling costs relative to their returns.
Live tortoises can be taken daily, but also be stored until the
entire animal is ready to be eaten. They can then be cooked and

J.C. Thompson, C.S. Henshilwood / Journal of Archaeological Science 41 (2014) 214e229

consumed without having to prepare the remainder of the animal
for future use. In contrast, the amount of group coordination
required to hunt and process a large ungulate (or the coordination
required to snare or net-drive smaller ungulates) presents a much
more immediate, socially visible output of investment. Chelonian
biomass is often very high relative to that of mammals in a given
area (Iverson, 1982) and encounter rates are expected to be high
relative to other slow-moving prey. Although the slow growth and
reproduction of tortoises in general makes their populations susceptible to over-exploitation (Stiner et al., 2000), Chersina populations have a high inherent ability to rebound once intense
predation pressure is removed (van Heezik et al., 1994). All of these
factors make tortoises attractive food resources on the South African landscape, and they should have been taken upon encounter
particularly by individuals within the group who were engaged in
collecting activities.
5. Conclusions
Initial work on MSA subsistence took at face value that the
faunal remains recovered in association with MSA artefacts were
solely the result of human subsistence choices. Microscopic
research at several MSA cave sites along the South African coast has
shown there is more complexity in large mammal fossil assemblages (Marean et al., 2000; Thompson, 2010; Thompson and
Henshilwood, 2011), but no comparable study had been done on
a sizeable tortoise assemblage. Bone surface modiﬁcation of the
tortoise assemblage at BBC showed that MSA people were the main
accumulators and modiﬁers of the tortoises in the M1 phase, and all
other lines of evidence (taxonomic and skeletal element abundances) showed the same to be true for the M3 phase. Burning
patterns in the M1 phase also demonstrated that tortoises were
processed by being cooked upside down in their shells, which
allowed for a general model of tortoise processing to be proposed.
There is no evidence that tortoise shells were used as containers. A
contributory factor might be the high degree of burning evident on
the shells which would render them unsuitable for that purpose.
This study showed that analyses of skeletal element abundances
based only on a single element are insufﬁcient in the face of variable taphonomic processes even within the same site. Chersina
taphonomy and ecology proved to be highly informative about
aspects of MSA subsistence that have previously been undocumented. For example, the relatively small tortoise size noted by
Henshilwood et al. (2001b) may be explicable in terms of a femalebiased sex ratio. Other aspects of tortoise taphonomy that should
be explored in more depth with modern collections are allometric
body size relationships, relative proportions of butchery marks, and
burning patterns on bushﬁre-produced tortoises.
