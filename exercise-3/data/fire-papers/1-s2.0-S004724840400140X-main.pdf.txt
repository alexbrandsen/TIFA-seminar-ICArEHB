Abstract
This paper presents a multidisciplinary study on the size of the occupied surfaces, provisioning strategies and
behaviour planning at the Romani rock-shelter, using the Middle Palaeolithic record of the level i. This level is dated
around 46.000 BP through U/Th ages. A behavioural interpretation is proposed, which emphasises the activities and the
systemic value of the archaeological artefacts and structures.
Occupation patterns are identiﬁed on the basis of the accumulations formed by human activities. These
archaeological accumulations, consisting of artefacts and hearths, are easily deﬁned visually as spatial units. The
relationships between these accumulations, established by means of reﬁtted remains, indicate that diﬀerences can be
established between: 1) small and medium-sized occupation surfaces; 2) restricted and diversiﬁed provisioning
strategies. This variability suggests that diﬀerent modes of occupation are represented in the same archaeological level.
The human activities reveal the generalization of ﬁre technology. In almost all sizes of the occupation surfaces, the
exploitation of vegetal resources near the Abric Romani marks the threshold of the restricted provisioning strategy.
Limited use and fragmented knapping activities are recorded in the lithic assemblage. Faunal remains show diﬀerential
transport. The exploitation of lithic, faunal and vegetal resources characterizes the diversiﬁed provisioning strategy.
The small occupation surfaces and restricted provisioning strategies suggest short settlements in the Abric Romani.
This shorter occupation model complements the longer diversiﬁed provisioning strategy recorded in both small and
medium-sized occupied surfaces. The selection of precise elements for transport and the possible deferred consumption

Introduction
Behavioural strategies are currently considered
to be one of the most essential components in
interpreting the archaeological record of prehistoric hunter-gatherers. This is especially clear in
the case of the European Middle Palaeolithic, since
behaviour has become central to the debate on the
biological and cultural characterisation of Neanderthals and their role in the evolutionary
sequence of human populations. Of the various
domains that deﬁne human behaviour, settlement
patterns are particularly important due to their
eﬀects on the variability of lithic and faunal
assemblages, a long-standing issue in Middle
Palaeolithic research.
Research into settlement patterns, then, focuses
on two interrelated issues: on the one hand, the
modes and types of occupation and, on the other,
mobility strategies. Both issues can be approached
using theoretical models derived from ethnoarchaeological studies, which provide the sole available
referent to deﬁne the variability spectrum in the
archaeological record. Nevertheless, these models
give rise to a series of signiﬁcant problems and,
although most archaeologists are aware of them,
their implications are rarely accepted. The main
problem derives from the diﬀerent time scales that
characterise the archaeological and ethnoarchaeological records. Archaeological units e generally
established using stratigraphic criteria e are not
correlated with the time scale observed in the
ethnographic context. On the contrary, they are
the product of cultural and natural formation
processes that have taken place over diﬀerent
periods of time. Unlike the occupational contemporaneity of the material remains documented in
a settlement of current hunter-gatherers, archaeological levels are palimpsests that normally include
remains of diﬀerent occupational events, which

cannot be distinguished only by stratigraphic
criteria.
Although at present archaeologists tend to
recognise that the archaeological units they
analyse are palimpsests, their reconstruction of
settlement patterns often does not take into
account this temporal framework. As a matter of
fact, many interpretations seem to assume that all
the remains recovered in an archaeological level
are contemporaneous or, at least, correspond to
the same occupation type. The aim of this paper is
to identify the occupation modes represented in
level i of the Abric Romanı́ site (Capellades,
Spain). We assume from the start that several
occupational events may have contributed to its
formation. We also assume that these events could
have been diﬀerent, as far as factors like the
duration of the occupation or group size are
concerned. Our approach to the archaeological
record is, therefore, to deﬁne spatial units that are
vertically and horizontally well characterised inside the stratigraphic level. Establishing the
temporal relationships between these units is one
of the main aims of this research. Their synchronicity will not be assumed, but justiﬁed by the
connections found between them. This procedure
will make it possible to show the variability of
occupational models, which would go unnoticed if
the archaeological level were approached as
a homogeneous unit.
In this paper we adopt a multidisciplinary
approach to the so-called mousterian variability
(Binford, 1973; Bordes, 1981). We aim to bring
together diﬀerent theoretical and methodological
perspectives, such as lithic technology, zooarchaeology, taphonomy and spatial analysis. The
archaeological interpretation is based on a behavioural approach, which takes into account the
processual nature of interpretation, and the
systemic value of the material remains and

dates obtained at the Abric Romanı́ site are
considerable (Bischoﬀ et al., 1988; Bischoﬀ and
Fitzpatrick, 1991; Carbonell et al., 1994), and the
stratigraphic succession has been dated by U/Th
between 70 and 40 ka BP. This time span extends
from the middle of OIS 3 back to OIS 5
(Dansgaard et al., 1993). In addition, human
occupations have contributed to the sedimentary
composition with materials that are suitable for
radiocarbon dating. This research has made it
possible to verify and calibrate the U/Th and C14
dates in key biocultural periods, like the Middle/
Upper Palaeolithic boundary at the Abric Romanı́
(Bischoﬀ et al., 1994), or the Upper Pleistocene/
Holocene boundary at the Abric Agut (Vaquero
et al., 2002)
The vegetation at the cornices of the Cinglera
del Capelló is outstanding because of the presence
of species encrusted by carbonates. There is an
abundance of diﬀerent mosses, but the presence of
bryophyte pseudomorphs (Dydymodon, Eucladium,
Ctenidium) and the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris
(Carbonell, 1992) in fossil travertines is particularly signiﬁcant. This is an association that is

the archaeological structures. This paper deals
with the organisational strategies of the occupational events on level i of the Abric Romanı́.

Antecedents and geo-ecological framework
of Abric Romanı́ and level i
The Abric Romanı́ is a sedimentary deposit
located in a cliﬀ known as the Cinglera del
Capelló, at the village of Capellades (50 km west
of Barcelona, 280 m above sea level) (Fig. 1). The
Cinglera is made up of carbonated quaternary
sediments of lacustrine and spring origin. The
complex neotectonic history of the Capellades area
and the fault of the river Anoia have contributed
to the cliﬀ formation. At the beginning of the 20th
century, Amador Romanı́ carried out intense
archaeological activity at the Cinglera del Capelló,
and several pleistocene and holocene sites were
found and documented (Bartroli et al., 1995). The
dates of these deposits have been established by
archaeological seriation and radiometric dating at
diﬀerent sites. The quantity and quality of U/Th

characteristic of dripping environments, which are
called Adiantetea communities, typical in travertine
deposits (Folch, 1981).
Twelve archaeological levels (from A to M)
have been excavated so far at the Abric Romanı́
sequence. Except for level A (Early Upper Palaeolithic), all the other levels correspond to Middle
Palaeolithic occupations. Amador Romanı́ mostly
excavated the uppermost archaeological layers at
the beginning of the 20th century and they provide
only very fragmentary information on human
strategies. It is from level H downwards (Carbonell,
1992) that the archaeological ﬁeldwork carried
out since 1983 has exposed a continuous surface
suitable for a spatial reading of the archaeological
record. Level i, mainly excavated between 1991
and 1992, is in this context. The chronology of
level i has been established by U/Th at ca.
46 ka BP. The U/Th dates correspond to
the travertine layers overlying and underlying
this level. We have four results for the underlying
travertine: 48.6 G 2.3; 46.9 G 2.6; 46.5 G 1.5 and
46.3 G 2.4. The overlying travertine has been
dated at 45.1 G 3.1 ka BP. This layer has recently
been dated at 46.6 G 1.7 ka BP (Bischoﬀ, per.
com. 1.07.02).
According to the pollen analysis, level i is
located in the coldest phase of the Abric Romanı́
stratigraphy (Burjachs and Julià, 1994). This pollen
zone is characterised by low percentages of
arboreal pollen. The dominance of Asteraceae,
Poaceae, and Artemisia suggests steppe vegetation.
The archaeological excavation of level i exposed
a large surface of over 195 m2. Nevertheless, in
some areas ancient excavations had already removed the level. These areas were basically Pits 1
and 2, excavated by Amador Romanı́ (Bartroli
et al., 1995). During the ﬁfties, Dr. Eduard Ripoll
cleaned Pit 1 and excavated two L-shaped trenches
that also aﬀected level i. In Romani’s and Ripoll’s
stratigraphies, level i appears as Bed 11.
Level i is located on a discontinuity surface,
which is documented in all the available sections of
the trial excavations in the archaeological interventions mentioned earlier. This surface was
formed by gours or pools situated along a stepped
surface. Two transversal travertine bars separating
three relatively ﬂat surfaces formed these steps.

The two upper surfaces contained metre-size gours
close to the travertine bars and joined by small
paleo-channels. In the lowermost surface, the
gours were centimetre-size. In the sedimentary
deposits ﬁlling the gours, level i overlay a series of
low energy facies (laminated sands). In fact, the
archaeological record is mostly included in a layer
of crystalline gravels from the shelter’s wall. The
surfaces regularised by the travertine bars, where
the gours are situated, consisted of travertine
accretions and tuﬀaceous bioconstructions.
The discontinuity surface where level i was
documented was fossilised by a tabular stratum.
This stratum was also overlaid throughout the
shelter by a discontinuity surface with metre-size
and centimetre-size gours in travertine accretion
deposits. Archaeological level H is located over
this stratum.
Sedimentary processes of subaerial exposure e
such as stromatolithic accretion and cryoclastism e
are common in the lithological composition of
archaeological level i. It should be emphasised
that the sedimentary successions at the top and
the bottom of level i do not contain archaeological remains. Excavation over a large surface
made it possible to characterise the various
lithological contexts where the archaeological
remains are located: crystalline gravels, laminated
sands of gour ﬁllings and travertine deposits.
The structures and archaeological record of the
well-preserved human occupations correspond to
a phase of dry sedimentation. At least, this phase is
drier than the one corresponding to the succession
of gour facies and travertine accretion, which
indicates wetter sedimentary processes with a predominance of dripping from the shelter’s ceiling
(Giralt and Julià, 1996). The detailed archaeostratigraphy indicates that these wetter facies are
distributed before and after the formation of the
archaeological record from human activities.

Materials and methods
The interpretation of the archaeological record
from level i is the outcome of a multidisciplinary
study recently published in a monographic book
(Carbonell, 2002). Below we synthesise the results

J. Vallverdú et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 48 (2005) 157e174

provided by the diﬀerent analytic domains: lithic
technology, use-wear analysis of artifacts, raw
material provisioning, zooarchaeological and taphonomic studies of faunal remains, identiﬁcation
and characterization of vegetal remains (basically
charcoal and wood pseudomorphs). Finally, we
describe and analyse the evident structures
(Meignen, 1994). The most common archaeological structures are hearths. Other archaeological
structures documented in the rock-shelter are the
product of travertine blocks moving inside the
shelter. Other natural features, such as large
blocks, or the stalagmite of the Coveta Ripoll,
may have been used in occupation patterns. Coveta
Ripoll is a small dissolution cavity close to the wall
of the rock-shelter delimited by a speleothem
development from the wall and the ground.
The lithic assemblage
The number of lithic remains recovered in level i
is relatively low (about 500 remains larger than
1 cm), especially if we take into account that the
amount of surface excavated was extensive. Flint is
the dominant raw material (60%), although the
variability is considerable compared to other
archaeological levels of the Abric Romanı́ succession (Carbonell et al., 1996a; Carbonell et al.,
1996b). The percentage of quartz and limestone
was also signiﬁcant (39%). At other archaeological
levels, especially the uppermost ones, the dominance of ﬂint is more pronounced. In this respect,
level i resembles the immediately underlying
archaeological level Ja, characterised by a signiﬁcant use of quartz and limestone, both of which
should be considered as strictly local, since they
are available and plentiful in the vicinity of the
site. The geological formations bearing a signiﬁcant
quantity of ﬂint are further away, although only
5 km from the shelter. In addition, there are large
outcrops of good quality ﬂint within a 15 km
radius.
The technological processes are characterised
by a ﬂexible reduction strategy, aimed at maximising the number of ﬂakes per core. The knapping methods should be placed in a context deﬁned
by the absence of hierarchical cores and a low
degree of predetermination. These characteristics

161

are common in the framework of discoid methods.
Nevertheless, the small number of cores found in
level i prevents the reduction strategies from being
reconstructed in detail. The number of retouched
artifacts is also very low and almost all of them are
denticulates and notches, as is the case with the
other Middle Palaeolithic levels at the Abric
Romanı́. The technological processes indicate
low intensity knapping activities, and use-wear
analyses also show a limited use of artifacts. The
reduction sequences are temporally and spatially
very fragmented. There is some relationship
between the evidence of woodworking and reduction sequences where most of the chaıˆne
ope´ratoire is present at the site. On the other
hand, the artifacts used in butchering are items
transported from reduction sequences carried out
elsewhere. In general, the retouched artifacts seem
to correspond to cores knapped outside the
shelter. Transport is therefore a key factor in the
provisioning and use of raw materials.
The spatial distribution of lithic remains shows
some well-deﬁned and delimited accumulations,
corresponding to the location of core reduction
sequences. The size and raw material of the artifacts
in these accumulations are clearly homogeneous,
which, in turn, indicates a small number of
knapping episodes. Moreover, the various accumulations are not connected by reﬁts. The absence of
artifact transport between the main knapping areas
suggests that they were not contemporaneous and
may belong to diﬀerent occupation events.
The faunal remains
The faunal remains are made up of equid,
cervid and bovid and they clearly show evidence of
human activity directed towards obtaining animal
nutrients. The analysis of cut marks, bone
fractures, and signals of burning on bones indicated a primary access pattern to these herbivores, mostly prime-age adults. The prey was not
brought into the camp as complete carcasses;
cranial and limb parts were selected and transported to the rock-shelter. The axial elements of
cervid were also transported occasionally. Large
longitudinal cut-marks on bones also suggest that
strips of meat were obtained (Bunn, 1983).

162

The technique of fracturing bone to obtain the
marrow consists of separating the diaphysis and
the epiphysis. It is important to note that
epiphyses were systematically destroyed, since
their representation in the record is almost null.
The areas of bone breakage are spatially well
delimited. One of these areas is located beside the
Coveta Ripoll. Another is located in the squares
I-J/53-54, close to a travertine block.
The impact of other taphonomic agents is low.
For instance, carnivore marks have only been
recognised in 1.5% of the bone remains. Of the
natural agents, water stands out as it aﬀects 9.9%
of the bones, even though most of the rounding
and smoothing aﬀects only one side (the one
exposed to the surface). This, in turn, also suggests
weak water streams. However, we do not rule out
the possibility that, in certain areas of the rockshelter, the record was displaced. Finally, the
incidence of trampling and weathering in the
record is particularly low (1.3% and 0.5%
respectively).

been recognized. There are many oxalate crystals
in most of the samples and prismatic shapes of
Pinus sp., although some of the parenchymatous
tissue shapes may belong to Pinus sylvestris.
Over 100 wood imprints (WI) are documented
in level i. Their average length is 30 cm and their
average width 7 cm. The most outstanding imprints from level i are a trunk (measuring 3 x 0.5 x
0.5 meters) (Fig. 2) and two large accumulations.
One of them is located beside a hearth and the
other one on top of it, in a position that looks like
a tripod that has fallen on top of a hearth (Fig. 3)
(Carbonell and Castro-Curiel, 1995). There is also
another group consisting of a dense concentration
of small imprints that we interpret as the remains
of woodworking activities. The ratio of burned to
unburned remains in these imprints is 1:4 (burned/
unburned). In many imprints, only the distal
segment is burned.

The archaeobotanic record
The archaeobotanic record of Level i is diverse
and peculiar, since we have been able to recover
diﬀerent categories of macro and micro remains:
wood imprints (WI), charred woods, charcoals
and phytoliths.
A total of 452 charcoals were recovered from
the hearths. The main taxon identiﬁed was Pinus
silvestris/nigra salzmannii. This taxon includes two
species, scots pine and black pine, that currently
grow at over 800 m above sea level and which have
been recognised in about 60% of the charcoals.
Similarly, as in the rest of the sequence, the
prevalent percentage of conifers denotes the
existence of a forest growing near the site.
Furthermore, pinewood was preferred as fuel
because of its abundance in the immediate
environment (Allué, 2002).
Phytolith analysis was performed on both the
regular sediments from level i and the sediments
from the hearths. Gymnosperms, and in particular
tracheids, are the most important silicate phytoliths. Phytoliths from gramineae are less common
and cells from the Festucoideae subfamily have

Fig. 3. Singular tripod of wooded imprints from level i.

Hearths
Sixteen hearths have been recorded on level i.
They are ﬂat, without preparations and blocks,
and correspond to individual episodes of combustion. Hearths and archaeological artefacts are
spatially associated. The accumulations of archaeological material in and around hearths show an
occupational pattern characterised by the absence
of human secondary deposits. The micromorphological analysis of hearths also shows the absence
of secondary deposits, and an intensity of combustion lower than 300 degrees (Carbonell, 2002).
Anthropic and naturally located travertine blocks
There are many travertine blocks from the
shelter’s roof and wall. The spatial distribution of
these blocks shows two types of accumulations.
One line of blocks, parallel to the wall of the
shelter, was formed as a result of the roof
collapsing. Other groups of travertine blocks are
located outside this line. These blocks clearly have
a stratigraphic relation with the archaeological
assemblage and hearths, which suggests displacement during human occupations. In the ﬁeldwork,
these associations of blocks are known as Internal
Organisation of Travertine (IOT).
Spatial distribution: observed accumulations
The problems involved in characterising the
archaeological assemblage of level i can be summed

163

up with the concept of ‘‘living ﬂoor’’ (Bordes,
1975). We propose an empirical approach based on
the concept of accumulation: an area where the
archaeological assemblage formed by natural
and anthropic processes can be easily delimited
by means of visual observation (Villa, 1988)
(Fig. 4).
Archaeological remains are spatially clustered
in well-delimited accumulations that are generally
only a few centimetres thick. They can be easily
deﬁned as spatial analytical units, especially when
they are related to hearths (Vaquero and Pastó,
2001). Each accumulation is referred to with
Arabic numbers (Table 1 and Fig. 5). Our archaeostratigraphic research, based on the vertical plot of
the remains larger than 2 cm and the depth of the
archaeological structures such as hearths and
travertine blocks (Canals, 1993), indicated the
presence of stratiﬁed and non-stratiﬁed accumulations (Carbonell, 2002). The stratiﬁed accumulations have a clear diachronous archaeological
record, whereas the non-stratiﬁed accumulations
only show one horizon of remains. Stratiﬁed
accumulations are subdivided using a letter (Table
1). Despite the high resolution of the sedimentary
processes and their chronostratigraphy (Bischoﬀ
et al., 1988), and because of the lack of correspondence between these processes and the time
span of the human occupations, the stratiﬁed and
non-stratiﬁed accumulations should be considered
as occupational palimpsests or a long-term exposed surface, in the sense of a geological palimpsest (Riba, 1997).
Accumulations and natural formation processes
Archaeological materials from the bottom of
level i are located in accumulation 12c, which
consists of bone remains recovered in gour
deposits (L-K/45-46 squares). In this accumulation
3 MNI of cervid without stone tools have been
identiﬁed. Taphonomic analysis of these red deer
bones show that this assemblage is redeposited
(Cáceres, 1995). A bone reﬁt between accumulations 12c and 11c has been documented. Other
archaeological materials inside gours have been
recognized in accumulation 13b.
The archaeostratigraphy of level i is better
deﬁned in accumulation 11 (Carbonell, 2002).

During the ﬁeldwork, we recognised two phases of
cultural formation (11b and 11c), with two hearths
(III and IV) separated by a sterile layer. We also
identiﬁed a third accumulation (11a) by means of
an archaeostratigraphical analysis. This accumulation is made up of a senile equid tooth, a jaw
fragment of bovid and a wood imprint. The
stratigraphical relations between these archaeological materials enable us to characterise the main
natural formation processes of level i. From the
base to the top these are as follows:
The senile equid tooth from this accumulation
11a can be related to another isolated tooth
located in square M49 (accumulation 13b). This

skeletal element was the key in determining the
only MNI of senile equid. It was found in the base
of a succession of gour facies.
The bovid mandible from accumulation 11a
suggests a relationship with other bovid elements
from accumulation 14c near hearth IX, which
determine the only MNI of bovid in this level.
The natural processes that formed the wood
imprints from accumulation 11a show a relation
with the wood imprints from accumulations 6, 14b
and 12a.
Accumulation 11a is formed of archaeological
remains that show a spatial relation with other
accumulations attributed to diﬀerent sedimentary

layers. The bovid remains from accumulation 14c
are on the top of gour deposits. The stratigraphic
position of the equid tooth, however, is 20 cm
below hearth VI, in accumulation 13b. Thus, the
bovid remains are later than the dental remains of
the senile Equus. These archaeostratigraphic relations show that accumulation 11a is polygenetic
with redeposited and displaced remains.
We also identiﬁed disturbed materials in accumulation 14a. They are separated from the lower
accumulation 14b by a layer of silty gour sediments. These remains show orthogonal orientation
amongst them, which suggests displacement by
stream action (Isaac, 1989).
In conclusion, we have identiﬁed two moments of
natural formation processes of the archaeological

assemblages. The ﬁrst one is in the base of level i, in
accumulation 12c, and can be characterised by the
redeposition of archaeological remains. These
archaeological materials are inside gours with little
horizontal displacement. The second stratigraphic
context is at the top of the level, where natural
formation processes like re-sedimentation made
accumulations 11a and 14a. These accumulations
also consist of bone and vegetal remains (charcoals
and wood imprints). It is also worth pointing out
that they have a low density of archaeological
materials.
Finally, lithic reﬁts are not located in these
accumulations, which are formed by natural processes. Some bone reﬁts, however, have been
identiﬁed, such as the ones in 11a and 13b.

J. Vallverdú et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 48 (2005) 157e174

Accumulations and anthropic formation processes
The evidence of accumulations formed by
natural processes allows us to consider the
existence of accumulations through anthropic
processes. Cultural accumulations can be characterised by the same archaeostratigraphic and
lithological context with a stratigraphic connection
between artifacts and archaeological structures
such as hearths and travertine blocs.
On the basis of the presence of reﬁts, we have
distinguished two kinds of accumulations: ones
that are related, characterised by connections
between diﬀerent accumulations, and ones that
are unrelated, characterised by the absence of
connections with other clusters, although some
reﬁts have been identiﬁed within them.
Some accumulations cannot be properly characterised, because of the ancient excavations.
Therefore, we do not take into account the
accumulations formed by the archaeological record around hearths VII, XII and XV. These
accumulations make it very diﬃcult to make
a comparative characterisation.
Non-related anthropic accumulations
Accumulation number 1 contains hearth I and
a dense concentration of ﬂint. In this accumulation
some faunal remains from equid, small equid, and
cervid have also been identiﬁed. The use wear of
a ﬂint ﬂake from this accumulation shows that it
had been used in meat processing.
The archaeological record from accumulation
11b is very speciﬁc. There are cervid remains, with
no axial parts. It also contains hearth III and an
Internal Organization of Travertine (IOT). The
ﬂint and limestone remains, connected by reﬁts,
form a dense lithic concentration over the hearth.
Some of these lithic remains present a thermal
impact. The functional analysis of one of the ﬂint
ﬂakes from this accumulation shows traces of
woodwork. Some internal reﬁts have been found
on the periphery of this accumulation, close to
accumulation 5.
Accumulation 11c appears around hearth IV
and contains a high diversity of archaeological
remains. The lithic assemblage consists of ﬂint and
quartz. The faunal remains correspond to cervids
and equids.

167

Accumulation 13a consists of the archaeological remains located around hearth VI, and it is not
clearly delimited with respect to accumulation 14c
around hearth IX. These two accumulations
presented a high diversity of faunal remains of
equids, cervids and bovids. Moreover, the lithic
assemblage is characterised by the absence of ﬂint
and the presence of a quartzite reﬁtting. There are
no reﬁts between accumulations 13a and 14.
Accumulation 8 includes hearth XIII, an Internal Organization of Travertine, and lithic and
faunal remains. It should be pointed out that there
are few bone remains, and that these belong to an
equid cranium. The lithic assemblage around the
hearth consists of quartz, ﬂint and limestone.
Accumulation 5, with hearth X, has very few
lithic and bone remains. Three cervid tibiae and
a small equid tibia make up the bone record of this
accumulation. The lithic assemblage consists of
quartz, ﬂint and limestone. This accumulation has
reﬁttings near the travertine blocks in squares
M-N58-59, between accumulations 5 and 7.
Accumulation 7 has no hearth, and has an
internal limestone reﬁtting. This accumulation is
partly limited by the above mentioned travertine
blocks. One of the lithic remains has traces of
woodworking.
Related anthropic accumulations
Lithic and bone reﬁtting between accumulations suggest that there is a connection between the
non-stratiﬁed accumulations 3-4-6 and 10 and the
stratiﬁed ones 12b-14b. These related accumulations have a high degree of material diversity. The
main raw materials are ﬂint and limestone, followed by quartz. The faunal remains are dominated by equids.
Accumulations 3-4 and 6 are not clearly characterized because of the old archaeological excavations. Accumulation 3, with hearth II, has
dispersed lithic and bone remains, including an
equid molar with a singular modiﬁcation (Fig. 6).
This same modiﬁcation has also been documented
in another equid molar found at accumulation 14b,
near hearth XIV. Accumulation 3 contains large
wooded imprints (WI) that belong to a tree trunk.
Accumulation 4 has more bone remains and few
lithic remains, but there is a lithic reﬁtting between

Discussion

same individual. They were 8 meters apart. The marks on their
surface are currently being studied.

accumulations 3 and 4. Accumulation 6 shows
a high degree of burnt bones and near hearth XI
there is also a group of large wood imprints.
The related accumulation 14b has the greatest
density of archaeological material. These archaeological remains, around hearth XIV, are located in
front of the stalagmite that delimits the entrance to
the Coveta Ripoll. This accumulation has various
internal and external reﬁttings of ﬂint and limestone that show connections with accumulations
12b, 10 and 6. It is also characterised by small lithic
and bone remains, as well as small WI fragments.
In this accumulation, there are a large number of
equid cranial fragments, and also a few axial cervid
bones. It also contains many burned bone remains.
Additionally, the functional analysis of a ﬂint ﬂake
showed that it had been used on wood and meat.
In accumulation 10, the faunal assemblage
consists of reﬁtted equid dental and mandible
remains. The use-wear analyses indicate that a ﬂint
ﬂake had been used in meat processing.
Accumulation 12b includes hearth V and its
archaeological record consists of a few ﬂint and
limestone remains, and abundant cervid and equid
faunal remains. There are also many dispersed WI,
although there is a group of three lying together
over hearth V, which suggests the analogy with
a tripod mentioned earlier (Carbonell and CastroCuriel, 1995).

Level i consists of accumulations formed by
natural and cultural processes. The record of the
accumulations formed by anthropic processes is
located basically around archaeological structures,
such as hearths and Internal Organization of
Travertines. The record of the cultural accumulations shows two diﬀerent sedimentary moments
for human occupation, which had already been
documented during the ﬁeldwork and veriﬁed by the
archaeostratigraphic and lithic study (Carbonell,
2002).
The lithic and faunal reﬁtting made it possible
to distinguish between related and unrelated
accumulations. The lithic and faunal composition
of some accumulations is often highly speciﬁc.
This is due to sedimentary processes limiting the
formation of developed occupational palimpsests,
in the framework of a centennial-millennial time
span. Also, the dripping sedimentary processes e
related to the above mentioned wetter facies e
may have limited the suitability of the rock
shelter for human occupation (Vallverdú et al., in
press).
The main activities identiﬁed in these accumulations are the following (Table 2):
1. Knapping activities, as well as the consumption and abandonment of faunal remains.
These activities have been identiﬁed at the
non-related accumulations 1, 2, and 8 and 13a
and 14c and the related accumulations 2, 12b,
4, 6, 14b and 10.
2. Butchering activities. These activities have
been identiﬁed at accumulations 11b, 14b and
10. In the ﬁrst, there is evidence of the
butchering of a cervid that shows no axial
skeleton. Butchering activities at the related
accumulations 14b and 10 e near the Coveta
Ripoll e have been linked to the abandonment
of equid cranial elements.
3. Animal biomass conservation. These activities
may have taken place at accumulation 12b.
This accumulation contains the tripod on
hearth V (Carbonell and Castro-Curiel, 1995).
The interpretation of the meat conservation
activities is based on the large longitudinal

cut marks mentioned above, which show that

4. Exploitation and consumption of vegetal
resources. These activities are recorded in
almost all the accumulations on level i. There
are also other areas with vegetal remains
unrelated to ﬁre, such as the small WI
fragments at accumulation 14b. Traces of
woodworking were also identiﬁed through
traceological analyses at accumulations 12b,
11b, 7 and 3.
Occupational models at level i
The size of the accumulations formed by
anthropic activities and the analysis of the

diﬀerent categories of the record have made it
possible to identify two occupation models at the
shelter in level i. The ﬁrst has a small surface
area while the second is medium sized. Both
models are based on the distinction between the
related and unrelated accumulations (Figs. 7
and 8).
Occupation model of the small surface
The small model can be characterised by the
occupation of a surface between 9 and 20 square
meters (Table 2). The superimposition of lithic and
faunal remains around or over the hearths
characterises this model of occupation (Vaquero
and Pastó, 2001). The lithic activities identiﬁed in
the technological study are the introduction of

large ﬂakes and retouched artefacts, partially
reduced cores and limestone blocks.
This model shows two types of animal resource
provisioning: in-site processing and consumption,
or transport and consumption of animal parts
processed outside the site.
Occupation model on the medium-sized surface
This occupation model occupies 120 square
meters (Table 2). The various materials are
distributed diﬀerently on the surface. The faunal
remains are concentrated towards the exterior of
the area, at accumulations 4 and 12a. The lithic
remains tend to cluster at the accumulations near
to the wall, where the small faunal and lithic
remains overlap, just as they do in the small

occupation model. There are knapping sequences,
the introduction of limestone cobbles, and large
ﬂakes and retouched objects. Faunal remains show
that animal biomass was exploited, processed,
conserved and consumed at the site.
The fragmentation of the medium-sized occupation models, with a central domestic area and
a specialized peripheral area, has been described by
ethnoarchaeologists (Yellen, 1977; Binford, 1987).
No secondary accumulation related to intentional
refuse has been described. The overlapping of
structures (hearths and IOT) and archaeological
remains, as well as the clearly delimited accumulations, suggest the absence of this type of deposits.
The identiﬁcation of a domestic zone and
specialised areas, in the medium-sized occupation

model.

model, indicates an occupation pattern that was
more common during the Upper Paleolithic
(Simek, 1987). So, on level i the occupation model
varies according to the size of the occupied surface.
Exploitation models at the Abric Romanı´
and territorial mobility
The provisioning strategies identiﬁed show
a threshold of minimal activity, related to the
exploitation of the vegetal materials from the
surroundings of the site for fuel. This indicates
that ﬁre technology was widespread during this
period (Binford, 1988) and is present in almost all

the accumulations of human formation processes
(Arteaga et al., 2001). The combustion activities
around the hearths show a speciﬁc combustion of
pinewood (Allué, 2002).
The restricted provisioning strategy is characterised by highly fragmented fauna and lithic
operatory sequences, and suggests the existence
of a previous provisioning site. The Abric Romani
was basically a place of passage (Bibouac). The
restricted strategy of lithic and faunal resources
shows that the immediate surroundings were not
exploited (Table 3).
The diversiﬁed strategy documents the exploitation of lithic and faunal resources from the shelter’s

the site has been designed as a strategy of
provisioning individuals (Khun, 1995).
The exploitation models on level i show that
the groups were highly mobile. The diversiﬁed

provisioning strategy probably complements the
restricted one. This is based on accumulation 11b
(Table 3), which is small and has a diversiﬁed
exploitation. In these accumulations large quantities of burned bones coincide with diversiﬁed
provisioning strategies (Fig. 9).
It is also possible to suggest the absence of
previous occupation sites characterised by a diversiﬁed exploitation and a deferred consumption
of resources. In this way, regardless of the
demography or size of the occupied surface, the
mobility of the group is directly related to
the exploitation of hunting strategic resources.
The linear mobility between diverse geographical
areas and low segregation suggest the planning of
long movements with the abandonment of easily
replaceable objects and the transport of surplus.
