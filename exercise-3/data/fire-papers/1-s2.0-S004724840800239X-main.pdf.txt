This study examines trends in stone tool reduction technology at Liang Bua, Flores, Indonesia, where
excavations have revealed a stratiﬁed artifact sequence spanning 95 k.yr. The reduction sequence practiced throughout the Pleistocene was straightforward and unchanging. Large ﬂakes were produced offsite and carried into the cave where they were reduced centripetally and bifacially by four techniques:
freehand, burination, truncation, and bipolar. The locus of technological complexity at Liang Bua was not
in knapping products, but in the way techniques were integrated. This reduction sequence persisted
across the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary with a minor shift favoring unifacial ﬂaking after 11 ka. Other
stone-related changes occurred at the same time, including the ﬁrst appearance of edge-glossed ﬂakes,
a change in raw material selection, and more frequent ﬁre-induced damage to stone artifacts. Later in the
Holocene, technological complexity was generated by ‘‘adding-on’’ rectangular-sectioned stone adzes to
the reduction sequence. The Pleistocene pattern is directly associated with Homo ﬂoresiensis skeletal
remains and the Holocene changes correlate with the appearance of Homo sapiens. The one reduction
sequence continues across this hominin replacement.

Introduction
Excavations at Liang Bua, a limestone cave in West Flores,
Indonesia, have yielded a well-dated archaeological sequence
which spans some 95 k.yr. and two hominin species: Homo ﬂoresiensis from 95 ka to 17 ka and Homo sapiens from 11 ka to the
present (Brown et al., 2004; Morwood et al., 2004, 2005). The Liang
Bua archaeological sequence offers an unparalleled opportunity to
examine long-term trends in stone artifact production in the
context of hominin evolution and behavior in Southeast Asia
(Moore, 2005).
Recent studies have emphasized continuities in Southeast Asian
stone reduction technology. For example, similar patterns of stone
procurementdwith differentially distributed large-sized and
small-sized reduction productsdpersisted from the Pleistocene
through the Holocene (Moore and Brumm, 2007). Knapping
techniques and reduction sequences also remained remarkably
similar from Pleistocene sites occupied by non-modern hominins
(e.g., Brumm et al., 2006) to Holocene sites created by H. sapiens
(Bellwood, 1997; Moore, 2005:695–700). This undermines the

common assumption that large-sized ‘‘core tool’’ assemblages were
made by early hominins (e.g., Homo erectus) while small-sized
‘‘ﬂake tool’’ assemblages were made by H. sapiens (Moore and
Brumm, 2007). Some authors see technological change across
hominin species as inevitable (e.g., Hublin, 2000; Mellars, 2005),
and models explaining the modern human colonization of Southeast Asia are premised on abrupt industrial change (e.g., Foley and
Lahr, 1997, 2003; Mellars, 2006), but the empirical evidence in
Southeast Asia indicates technological continuity (Moore and
Brumm, 2007).
The Liang Bua sequence reﬂects this regional pattern; little
variation occurs in the stone reduction sequence across the period
of cave occupation. Other stone-related changes occur in the early
Holocene, ca. 11 ka, including a shift in preferred knapping material,
increased use of ﬁre in areas where stone tools were made and/or
used, and the abrupt appearance of ﬂakes with prominent edgegloss. A workshop for manufacturing Neolithic rectangularsectioned stone adzes was discovered near Liang Bua, but no
evidence for adze manufacture occurs in deposits inside the cave.
Adze manufacture was an independent technological ‘‘add-on’’ to
the far-simpler Liang Bua reduction sequence. The Holocene variations correlate with modern H. sapiens skeletal remains, but the
same reduction sequence is associated with both H. ﬂoresiensis and
H. sapiens.

Methodology

dataset. The approach of the study was to reconstruct stone tool
reduction sequences by stratigraphic unit and to track them across
the hominin replacement event. A ‘reduction sequence’ is ‘‘the
culturally and physically patterned way that people reduced pieces
of stone to useful tools’’ (Shott, 2003:95–96). Reconstructing the
reduction sequence involved matching Liang Bua artifacts to
products and attributes that correlate with known knapping

There are nine main stratigraphic divisions, or ‘‘units,’’ at Liang
Bua (Westaway et al., 2009) (Table 1). For this study we used 11,667
artifacts drawn from Units 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 (Table 2, Supplementary
Table 1). This subsumes the original sample (Moore, 2005, 2007;
Brumm et al., 2006; Moore and Brumm, 2007, 2009) within a larger

gestures and techniques. This knowledge derives from ethnographic observations of knapping and modern experiments in
fracture mechanics and stone toolmaking (Moore, 2005:29–84).
Analytical methods for identifying these matches include artifact
and attribute classiﬁcation, reconstruction of ﬂake scar overlap
sequences, and the conjoining of sequentially removed ﬂakes
(Moore, 2005:85–115).
Artifact classiﬁcation
Flaked-stone artifacts were divided into ﬂakes and ‘formed
objects’, or stones with ﬂakes removed from them.
Flakes Flakes were subdivided into a number of types that correlate
with knapping technique. ‘Early reduction ﬂakes’dcalled ‘macroﬂakes’ by Flenniken and White (1985) and ‘interior’ or ‘decortication’ ﬂakes by Flenniken and Stanﬁll (1980)dare a byproduct of
core reduction by freehand hard-hammer percussion. Early
reduction ﬂakes dominate the Liang Bua ﬂake assemblage. A
‘contact removal ﬂake’ was struck from the ventral surface of
a larger ﬂake and retained part of the larger ﬂake’s platform, ring
crack, and bulb of percussion (Figs. 1 and 2). ‘Redirecting ﬂakes’
were produced when core reduction was ‘‘re-directed’’ to a new
platform (McCarthy, 1976:22). They retained previous platform
features on their dorsal surface (Fig. 3). ‘Uniface retouching ﬂakes’
were struck from the dorsal surfaces of ﬂakes by freehand blows.
Their platforms are part of the parent ﬂake’s ventral surface.
Exterior platform angles usually measure between 50 –70 ,
reﬂecting the edge-angle of the retouched ﬂake. ‘Truncated ﬂakes’
and ‘truncation ﬂakes’ were made by placing ﬂakes ﬂat on an anvil

and breaking them with a hammerstone. The truncated ﬂake (a
type of formed object) retains the ﬂake blank’s platform and ring
crack; the other fragments are truncation ﬂakes (Fig. 4A). ‘Potlids’
are plano-convex ﬂakes detached when stone was heated (Fig. 5).
‘Heat-fracture fragments’ are angular or cuboidal pieces with
crenelated and sugary surfaces. ‘Hammerstone spalls’ were
detached from a cobble hammerstone during use. ‘Unidentiﬁed
ﬂakes’ includes technologically ambiguous ﬂakes or ﬂake
fragments.
Formed objects Modiﬁed ﬂakes were designated as ‘ﬂake blank
cores’ (Fig. 6) if they have mostly invasive negative scars
extending at least half-way to the center of the face (after Odell,
2004:74), or as ‘retouched ﬂakes’ (Fig. 7) if non-invasive scars
predominate. The dichotomy is blurred, however, because invasive and non-invasive scars sometimes occur together. ‘Radial
cores’, like ﬂake blank cores, were knapped bifacially and
centripetally in relation to a single reduction plane (Fig. 8). Some
radial cores may have been made on ﬂakes (they are ﬂake blank
cores) but they no longer retain the identifying characteristics. A
‘multiplatform core’ was knapped in relation to more than one
reduction plane, creating two or more platform surfaces (Fig. 9).
A ‘single platform core’ is a cobble or angular fragment knapped
unifacially in relation to a single reduction plane. ‘Bipolar artifacts’ are the byproducts of holding a ﬂake on an anvil edge-on
and striking the uppermost edge (Figs. 4B and 10). This contrasts
with truncating, where a core was placed ﬂat on an anvil and the
blow was delivered to the face (Fig. 4A). Bipolar cores and ﬂakes
are combined into the one category. A cobble with three or fewer

Attribute recording
Attributes occur across artifact types and were recorded independently from typological classiﬁcation. Flakes were often struck
from the ventral surfaces of ﬂake blanks at Liang Bua. A ‘detachment scar’ is a part of this ventral surface occurring on a ﬂake as
a dorsal facet (Fig. 13). Platform types recorded on ﬂakes include
‘cortical’ (the ring crack occurs on a cortical surface), ‘single facet’
(the ring crack occurs on a negative ﬂake scar), ‘dihedral’ (the ring
crack occurs on an arris between two ﬂake scars), and ‘multifacet’
(the ring crack zone is marked by more than two ﬂake scars).
Detachment scars occurring on platforms were classiﬁed as single
facet. Potlid scars and crenellation cracks were recorded as
evidence for burning (e.g., Fig. 5B and 5D). ‘Polish’ consists of
a discrete, bright patch of silica deposition on the edge of an artifact
(Sinha and Glover, 1983/1984). Polish was visible without magniﬁcation (Fig. 14). A number of metrical attributes, described below,
were recorded to allow certain comparisons.
Flake scar analysis
Sequences of ﬂake removals from cores can be determined by
conjoin studies, and several conjoin sets were reconstructed at
Liang Bua. However, most data on ﬂake removal sequences were
generated through ‘ﬂake scar analysis.’ The order of scar overlap
can be determined by differences in scar convexity, by the nature
and orientation of tiny step fractures on scar edges, and by
the interruption of linear striae and propagation ripples
(Moore, 2005:107–112). ‘Quadrant analysis,’ described below, is
a method for recording and manipulating the results of ﬂake scar
analysis.
Flake scars were classiﬁed into three types: ‘freehand’ scars,
created by the freehand reduction technique; ‘truncation’ scars,
created by the truncation technique; and ‘burin’ scars, created by
freehand blows oriented down the edge of a modiﬁed ﬂake or
radial core.

technologically ambiguous formed objects. ‘Anvils’ are cobbles
with pitted wear facets on one or both faces (Fig. 11) and
‘hammerstones’ are cobbles with pitted wear facets on the ends
or periphery (Fig. 12).

Knappers reduced water-rolled cobbles from the local riverbed,
terraces, and conglomerates. The closest extensive cobble source is
the Wae Racang River, presently located about 200 m to the north
and 30 m below the level of the cave. Selected materials consist
mainly (82.7%) of ﬁne- to medium-grained siliciﬁed tuff deposited
by Late Miocene-Early Pliocene submarine volcanic eruptions that
created the local tuff-bearing clastic limestone (Koesoemadinata
et al., 1994). A distinctive ﬁne-grained marine chert was gathered
mainly from river gravels but sometimes from an exposure near
bedrock, judging from a chalky cortex occurring on a few artifacts.
The chert category includes a small number of artifacts made from
cobbles of chalcedony, jasper, and opal.
The sizes of the ﬂake scars on the Liang Bua cores indicate that
blanks for the relatively large modiﬁed ﬂakes were usually made
outside the cave, probably at the stone source, whereas smaller,
unmodiﬁed ﬂakes that dominate the assemblage were generally
knapped on-site from the imported blanks (Fig. 16). In absolute
terms, imported ﬂake blanks were small (Table 3).
Flake types chosen for modiﬁcation included early reduction,
redirecting, truncation, and contact removal (Table 2). The modiﬁed
contact removal ﬂakes are relatively large (Fig. 1F and 6H) and they

were probably struck outside the cave. If so, this implies that there
were at least two off-site reduction options for making ﬂake blanks
carried to Liang Bua: by removing ﬂakes directly from cobbles, or by
removing ﬂakes from larger ﬂakes. Differential weathering of ﬂake
scars on some artifacts indicates that Unit 4 knappers also scavenged older ﬂaking debris for reuse (Fig. 17).
Whole cobbles were carried into the cave for reduction,
although this was very rare in comparison to the transport of ﬂake
blanks struck outside the cave. A few cobbles were abandoned after
being assayed. These abandoned cobbles tend to be tablet-shaped,

like large ﬂakes, rather than spherical. Single-platform cores,
which are rare in Unit 4, may be an end-point in reducing small,
angular cobble sections, while the distribution of remnant cortex
on several multiplatform cores suggests they resulted from cobble
reduction.
Hammerstones are volcanic river cobbles with large interlocking crystals that made them unsuitable as knapping material.
Hammerstones from Unit 4 are small and oblong in shape with
somewhat ﬂat faces and well-deﬁned ends. Use-wear pitting
occurs on the ends or slightly offset (Fig. 12).

Reduction techniques and the products of ﬂake modiﬁcation
Flakes were modiﬁed at Liang Bua by four techniques: freehand
percussion, burination, truncation, and bipolar percussion.
Early reduction ﬂakes were the principal byproducts of freehand
percussion. Some 42.8% of these were struck parallel to prior
removals, and 9.7% are elongated, measuring twice as long as wide
(Fig. 18). Some 7.4% have both features and can be considered
‘‘blades’’ (Fig. 19). Core scars are rarely elongated (Fig. 20) and this,
combined with the low proportion of blades, suggests that elongation and parallelness were not combined in any deliberate way
by the Unit 4 knappers. Long, slender ﬂakes in the assemblage were
probably the fortuitous result of occasionally applying an ‘‘inparallel’’ strategy of ﬂake removal to elongated zones of core mass
created incidentally during reduction (Moore, 2007).
Most contact removal ﬂakes were removed using platforms on
the lateral margins of ﬂakes near the proximal ends. Others were
removed by a freehand percussion blow delivered directly onto the
bulb of percussion, or by a burin blow that removed the proximal
end of the ﬂake (Figs. 1 and 2). Detachment scars occur on 3.1% of
the early reduction ﬂakes in Unit 4.
Uniface retouching ﬂakes were a byproduct of non-invasively
ﬂaking the dorsal surfaces of ﬂake blanks. Most ‘‘perforators’’
(Fig. 21) were produced this way. Sometimes unifacial retouching
was directed towards the blank’s ventral surface (e.g., Fig. 21C).
Burination is a variety of freehand percussion, but instead of
striking ﬂakes onto the relatively ﬂat surfaces of the core, the
knapper struck ﬂakes from the core’s edge (Fig. 22). The core edge
forms a ‘‘ridge’’ on the dorsal surface of the resulting ﬂake (Fig. 23).

If the ﬂake was struck directly down the core edge, the ridge is
located near the center of the ﬂake, giving it a roughly triangular
cross-section. A blow skewed more towards the ﬂat surface of the
core (a ‘tranchet’ blow [Debénath and Dibble, 1994]) resulted in
a ﬂake with a wedge-shaped cross-section. The Liang Bua ﬂakes
vary between these two extremes. Redirecting ﬂakes were created
if the core edge was reduced prior to being burinated. One or more
burin scars were recorded on 84 of the 439 radial cores, ﬂake blank
cores, and retouched ﬂakes from Unit 4.
Platforms on ﬂakes resulting from the burin and freehand
techniques are always unprepared, mostly single facet (86%), and

(Barnes, 1937; Knowles and Barnes, 1937) was sometimes produced
(Fig. 26). Ring cracks are visible on the faces of some artifacts
(Fig. 27). Crushing sometimes occurs on faces that were subjected
to repeated blows (particularly if the blows landed on an arris)
(Fig. 25A). Other truncation features were more subtle, consisting
of ripples radiating from a ring crack and fracture features such as
an eraillure scar and hackles appearing below the ring crack.
Some 49 of the 439 radial cores, ﬂake blank cores, and retouched
ﬂakes analyzed in Unit 4 have one or more truncation scars. All 62
truncated ﬂakes and 274 truncation ﬂakes were produced by the
technique.
Like the truncation technique, bipolar ﬂaking involved the use of
an anvil, but instead of placing the stone ﬂat on the anvil and
striking the face, the knapper held the stone upright and struck the
upper edge (Figs. 4B and 10). These stones were unmodiﬁed ﬂakes;
detachment scars appear on 37% of the 74 bipolar artifacts from

usually relatively shallow (Table 4). The Unit 4 knappers were
proﬁcient at applying strong hard-hammer blows very close to core
margins.
The truncation technique involved placing a ﬂake on an anvil
and striking the face (Fig. 4A). This often shattered the stone into
two or more fragments (Fig. 24). The technique detached early
reduction ﬂakes with steep exterior platform angles from thicker,
more robust stones (Fig. 25). Shatter fragments have characteristic
features (Crabtree, 1973:49; Elston, 1986:116; Bergman et al., 1987;
Root et al., 1999). Although the fracture was often initiated by
wedging, a ‘‘demicone’’ like that seen in gunﬂint manufacture

Figure 15. Unit 4 reduction sequence.

Unit 4, and none of the artifacts show signs of prior reduction by
freehand techniques. There is no evidence that pebbles were
knapped in this way. The bipolar technique was not practiced in
combination with any other knapping technique at Liang Bua.
Many of the multiplatform cores in the assemblage (Fig. 9)
probably began as ﬂake blank cores or radial cores and became
multiplatform through the bridging technique of edge burination
or truncation. The steep scars produced by these techniques
provided one or more non-centripetal platforms. Reduction from
these often eliminated evidence of the core’s original radial form.
Heavy bashing on two multiplatform cores from Unit 4 indicates
that they were used as hammerstones (Fig. 28) and three redirecting ﬂakes were recovered that removed heavily-bashed core
ridges.

Combinations of reduction processes: results of ﬂake scar analysis
The relationships between the freehand, burination, and truncation techniques were examined through ﬂake scar analysis. Flake
scars with intact edge features were created more recently than the
ﬂake scars with bisected features. This patterning allows the
reconstruction of an artifact’s reduction history. Modiﬁed ﬂakes
and radial cores were selected for ‘quadrant analysis’da procedure
for recording the sequence of ﬂake scar creation (Moore,
2005)dbecause they consist of two core volumes separated by
a centripetal platform edge. Artifacts were divided into four
quadrants labeled by cardinal directions. If the orientation of the
ﬂake blank could be determined, the blank’s platform end was
placed at the top, or ‘‘North.’’ If not, North was assigned arbitrarily.
Flake scar type and the order of scar intrusion on and between faces
were recorded in reference to these quadrants (Fig. 29).
The quadrant data were parsed to identify the way that stoneworkers integrated their knapping techniques. The quadrant data
were ﬁrst divided into series of knapping blows. This was done by
drawing ‘‘hard’’ breaks between reduction series that occurred in
non-adjacent quadrants; hard breaks are similar to starting
reduction anew. In other words, knapping occurs on a new part of
a previously-reduced artifact. Reduction series separated by hard
breaks are referred to as ‘cells.’

The cell data were then divided according to knapping gesture.
‘Soft’ breaks were gestural changesdsuch as a change in technique
or ﬂipping the stonedthat occurred between sequential ﬂake scars.
Soft breaks divided cells into 13 combinations called ‘permutations’
(Table 5).
Some 782 reduction cells were recorded on 439 formed objects
from Unit 4, and the cells were parsed into 1384 permutations. The
permutations are arranged into a cyclical diagram (Fig. 30), with
the numbers of blows delivered in permutations counted for each
item (Fig. 31).
Reduction in Unit 4 was a dynamic process characterized by
a short sequence (3 blows on average) followed by a change in
orientation or technique, followed by another short sequence, and
so on. Sequences were made up of 2 gestural changes on average,
although up to 8 changes sometimes occurred. Many artifacts were
abandoned after 1 blow, and the average number of blows per
artifact was 9. The maximum number of blows on an artifact was
39, and the maximum number of blows without a gestural change
was 23.
The freehand technique was the most common: some threequarters of the permutations began with freehand reduction.
Nearly half of the freehand blows were applied in the unifacial
permutation, but the bifacial permutation is also well-represented.
Over one quarter of reduction cells began with a truncation blow
and nearly one-ﬁfth ended with one. The stone was rarely ﬂipped in
the middle of a truncation sequence. Burination was uncommon
compared to freehand and truncation techniques. Burination was
frequently interspersed with freehand reduction, but only occasionally with the truncation technique.
Technological continuity and change at Liang Bua
Continuity in technological proxies
Dramatic technological change should be indicated by the
appearance or disappearance of artifact types and attributes that
serve as proxy indicators of reduction sequences. Most of the Unit 4
proxies are found in all of the stratigraphic units at Liang Bua
(Table 6). This indicates that one reduction sequence persisted
throughout the history of cave occupation.

Bipolar artifacts are absent from Units 2 and 7. The absence of
bipolar reduction in Unit 2 possibly relates to the small sample from
this deposit. Bipolar reduction is present in the units before and
after Unit 7 and its absence there is probably a sampling
phenomenon.
Aside from bipolar artifacts, the frequency of the proxy types
varies little in the cave’s Pleistocene deposits. No signiﬁcant
difference exists between Unit 4 and Units 2/3 (chi-square ¼ 3.02;
df ¼ 2; p > 0.05), or between Unit 4 and Unit 7 (chi-square ¼ 3.37;
df ¼ 2; p > 0.05). However, the frequency varies signiﬁcantly
between these units and Holocene Unit 9 (chi-square ¼ 10.60;
df ¼ 2; p < 0.01).
Continuity in reduction sequence is evident across the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary, but there are differences in the expression of the technology. The following sections explore these
differences by comparing and contrasting the Pleistocene pattern in
combined Units 2, 3, 4, and 7 with the Holocene pattern in Unit 9.

Figure 16. Charts comparing artifact and core scar sizes, Unit 4. Chart A compares
maximum core scar sizes (N ¼ 3145) and maximum modiﬁed ﬂake sizes (N ¼ 392). The
scars on cores discarded in the cave are too small to account for the sizes of blanks
chosen for modiﬁcation. Chart B compares the maximum thicknesses of unmodiﬁed
early reduction (‘ER’) ﬂakes (N ¼ 846) and modiﬁed ﬂakes (N ¼ 392). The unmodiﬁed
ﬂakes are consistently thinner than the modiﬁed ﬂakes. Chart C compares maximum
core scar sizes (N ¼ 3145) and maximum unmodiﬁed early reduction ﬂake sizes
(N ¼ 1654, complete ﬂakes only). The substantial overlap suggests that the unmodiﬁed
ﬂakes in the cave were struck from the cores discarded there. Elimination of larger
scars through progressive reductiondcalled ‘ﬂake scar erasure’ by Braun et al.
(2005)dmight explain a lack of large scars on cores. However, if large ﬂakes were
frequently produced in the cave, a continuous distribution in ﬂake thicknesses should
occur, but Chart B shows this is not the case. Flake scar erasure begins after the removal
of around 15 ﬂakes (Braun et al., 2005) and the average number of blows on knapped
objects in Unit 4 is 9.2. Detachment scars and other ventral attributes are ‘‘unerased’’
on a large proportion of cores. These data suggest that blanks for modiﬁcation were
struck from cores that were discarded somewhere outside the cave.

A valuable approach to exploring technological expression is to
compare and contrast blow counts from various techniques. It can
be assumed that one knapping blow produces a ﬂake and a scar,
which are studied as objects (artifacts) and attributes (scars).
The median number of blows per object for the combined
Pleistocene and Holocene assemblages was 9. A median test (Siegel,
1956) shows that the individual assemblages differ little in this
regard (chi-square ¼ 0.31; df ¼ 1; p > 0.05).
Table 7 shows the total number of blows per object by knapping
technique. The freehand technique appears to have been more
popular in the Holocene, at the expense of the burin and truncation
techniques. No statistical difference occurs between the burination
and truncation techniques for the two samples (chi-square ¼ 2.02,
df ¼ 1, p > 0.05) but a comparison of combined burin/truncation
data to the freehand data shows signiﬁcantly more use of the
freehand technique in the Holocene (chi-square ¼ 39.11; df ¼ 1;
p < 0.001).
This trend in blow type is also visible in the artifact count
data: there are signiﬁcantly greater numbers of early reduction
ﬂakes relative to truncation ﬂakes and redirecting ﬂakes (a proxy
of the burin technique) in the Holocene deposits (chisquare ¼ 27.54, df ¼ 1, p < 0.001). Comparing freehand blows to
bipolar blows, there is a signiﬁcant increase in freehand blows in
the Holocene (chi-square ¼ 52.72, df ¼ 1, p < 0.001, where the
number of bipolar blows is equivalent to the number of negative
scars on bipolar artifacts). Much of this variation is attributable to
an increase in the popularity of freehand blows relative to the
other techniques.
Flake shape and size differed little between the Pleistocene and
Holocene. Ratios of blades to non-blades do not differ signiﬁcantly
(chi-square ¼ 0.33, df ¼ 1, p > 0.05), nor does maximum ﬂake size
(chi-square ¼ 0.21, df ¼ 1, p > 0.05; the median value for pooled
data is 29 mm).

Continuity and change in permutation data
Quadrant data indicate how many blows were applied before
a break in reduction gesture, including the hard breaks that deﬁne
reduction cells and the soft breaks that divide the cell into knapping permutations. In contrast to ﬂake/scar counts, blows and cells/
permutations do not always relate to each other in a 1:1 ratiodcells
and permutations might be made up of any number of blows
depending on how they were broken-up by gestural breaks.
All of the 13 possible knapping permutations applied in the
Pleistocene were also applied in the Holocene (Table 8). Permutations were also used in the same frequencies: no signiﬁcant
difference occurs between these two samples for the burin technique (chi-square ¼ 1.66, df ¼ 2, p > 0.05), the freehand technique

(chi-square ¼ 8.20, df ¼ 4, p > 0.05), or the truncation technique
(chi-square ¼ 1.91, df ¼ 4, p > 0.05).
Quadrant data include the numbers of blows delivered prior to
a gestural switch. This ﬁgure is the same in the Pleistocene and
Holocene for the burin technique (chi-square ¼ 0.008, df ¼ 1,
p > 0.05; the median value for pooled data is 2 blows) and the
truncation technique (chi-square ¼ 0.67, df ¼ 1, p > 0.05; the
median value for pooled data is 1 blow). However, signiﬁcantly
more freehand blows preceded a gestural switch in the Holocene
(chi-square ¼ 34.45, df ¼ 1, p < 0.001; the median value for pooled
data is 3 blows). This is consistent with the ﬂake/scar count patterns.
Freehand permutations consist of bifacial and unifacial variants.
In the bifacial variant, blows are delivered to one face, the stone is
ﬂipped, and a blow is delivered to the opposite face. The number of

Figure 19. Scatterplot of early reduction ﬂake elongation and parallel index, Unit 4. Elongation was calculated by dividing length by width. An elongated ﬂake is one that scores 2.0
or more (after Bar-Yosef and Kuhn, 1999). A ﬂake’s parallelness was determined by measuring the orientation of negative scars relative to the ﬂake’s percussion axis. This was done
on whole ﬂakes with at least two identiﬁable dorsal scars. Individual measurements were averaged, giving the ﬂake’s ‘‘parallel index.’’ Because the ripples that indicate scar
orientation form an arc, parallel ﬂakes were deﬁned as those with dorsal scar orientations averaging 20 . ‘‘Blades’’ occur in the box at upper left. The data distribution does not
suggest that elongation and parallelness were combined in any deliberate way by the Unit 4 knappers.

blows before this ﬂip is statistically the same in the Pleistocene and
Holocene (chi-square ¼ 0.46, df ¼ 1, p > 0.05; the median value for

variant. Holocene knappers delivered signiﬁcantly more unifacial

in Holocene assemblages (Glover, 1981:22–25; Sinha and Glover,
1983/1984). The lack of edge-damage associated with the gloss
suggests relatively soft materials were cut and not, for example,
bamboo (Glover, 1986:207–209). The gloss patches may have been
created by splitting canes or grasses for use in mat weaving or
basketry (Sinha and Glover, 1983/1984).

Changes in the lithic assemblage

Discussion

The lithic analysis demonstrates that technological variation in
the Liang Bua sequence did not involve change in reduction
sequence or stone knapping techniques, but by a shift in emphasis:
Holocene knappers delivered more freehand blows in unifacial
series. However, the Pleistocene/Holocene transition was marked
by other sorts of changes in the stone artifact assemblages: the
amount of burned stone increased dramatically, the use of chert
became predominant, and edge-glossed chert ﬂakes appear.

The reduction sequence at Liang Bua was uncomplicated: small
ﬂakes were produced from large ﬂakes by technically

Raw materials Chert artifacts comprise less than 17% of the Pleistocene assemblage but more than 60% of the Holocene assemblage
(Table 9). In the latter case, most of the chert was obtained from
bedrock or colluvial sources, as shown by patches of soft, chalky
cortex.
Burned fragments The frequency of burning is negligible in the
Pleistocene, composing less than 1% in Unit 4 and absent entirely from
Units 2, 3, and 7. In contrast, nearly 18% of the Holocene artifacts are
heat-fracture fragments or artifacts that show signs of burning (Table
10). There is no evidence that this damage resulted from deliberate
heat-treatment, such as differential gloss indicating pre-heating and
post-heating reduction (Crabtree and Butler, 1964). Rather, the chert
was burned by accidental exposure of artifacts to ﬁre.
Edge-glossed artifacts Edge-glossed artifacts are limited to the
Holocene deposits at Liang Bua. Most are chert early reduction
ﬂakes (Table 11). Gloss occurs on these tools as a discrete patch of
silica deposited mostly on the ﬂake’s dorsal surface adjacent to an
unmodiﬁed edge (Fig. 14). The edge itself may be polished and
slightly rounded but is rarely damaged by microﬂaking. Tools with
similar edge gloss are found throughout the islands of Indonesia,
dating perhaps as early as 38 ka on Sulawesi, and are very common

Figure 20. Scatterplot of core scar elongation, Unit 4. Length is the dimension parallel
to the percussion axis projected to the existing platform edge (where necessary), and
width is the maximum dimension at right angles to length. Scars were measured to the
nearest mm and multiple instances of the same measurements are obscured. Relatively
few core scars were elongated. Given that progressive ﬂake scar elimination tends to
decrease ﬂake scar width to a greater degree than ﬂake length, the scatterplot probably
overestimates of the number of elongated ﬂakes removed from these cores.

Platform depth was measured on conchoidally-initiated ﬂakes as the distance from
the point of force application to the dorsal edge of the platform. This attribute
measures how far from the core edge the knapper delivered the percussion blow.

outside the cave, reﬂecting an economic decision to reduce cobbles
at the source into maximally useful pieces. Small ﬂakes were struck
inside the cave by hammerstone blows delivered 6 mm from the
core edge on average, a precision that attests to exceptional handeye coordination. A combination of three techniques was used:
freehand (unifacial and bifacial), truncation, and burin. The three

techniques were integrated in repeated patterns; most often the
freehand technique anchored a reduction event, and the truncation
and burin techniques were applied at the beginning or end.
Reduction followed a staccato rhythm with, on average, 3 blows
followed by a change in orientation or technique, followed by a few
more blows, and so on. Cores were usually abandoned after 9 blows
and never more than 39. Extended series of blows were exceptional
but sometimes practiced; this is how retouched pieces called
‘perforators’ were created. Flakes were reduced by bipolar ﬂaking
but not in combination with the other three techniques.

The Liang Bua stone technology can be seen as unsophisticated
when measured against archaeological convention. However, the
locus of complexity at Liang Buadthe ways the three knapping
techniques were integrateddis not described by conventional
morphological, typological, and technological criteria (e.g., BarYosef and Kuhn, 1999; Ambrose, 2001; Foley and Lahr, 2003). There
is ample evidence that the Liang Bua knappers were not only skilled
at applying their chosen techniques, but they also had a large
repertoire of reduction gesturesdpermutations of technique
combinationsdthat were themselves mixed in non-random ways

(or, in the case of bipolar ﬂaking, were always practiced in isolation). A complex decision-making process was operating, although
the factors governing these decisions are presently unknown. Stone
ﬂaking at Liang Bua was neither a random nor a casual exercise in
rock-breaking.
Also worth noting is that a signiﬁcant development in local
stone knapping technologydthe manufacture of edge-ground,
rectangular-sectioned adzes from about 4 ka (Fig. 32)dis poorly
represented within Liang Bua, consisting exclusively of ﬁnished
examples found as grave goods with Neolithic and Palaeo-Metallic

H. sapiens burials excavated at the site by Verhoeven and Soejono
(see Morwood et al., 2009).
Stone debris from edge-ground adze manufacture from the
open-air Neolithic site of Golo Roang, located about 500 m to the
northeast of Liang Bua, shows how these artifacts were produced.
The adzes were made on large chert ﬂakes. Edge-squaring was
accomplished by indirect percussion (see Stafford, 1993, 1999) in
two or three reduction stages (Moore, 2005:183–184). The process
produced distinctive adze ﬂaking debris with near-90 exterior
platform angles, exaggerated bulbs of percussion, expanding

shapes, relatively ﬂat long-sections, frequent hinge terminations,
and dihedral or multifacet platforms. Most of the ﬂake scars
were ground away in the ﬁnal reduction stage. One squaresectioned adze recovered on Flores was reworked bifacially and
centripetally by freehand percussion after edge-grinding, the same
reduction approach used to reduce ﬂake blanks at Liang Bua
(Fig. 32B).
Square-sectioned adze manufacture was practiced contemporaneously with the reduction sequence inside Liang Bua. Although
adze manufacture was part of the reduction sequence practiced
during the Neolithic on Flores, its absence from Liang Bua indicates
that it occurs as an ‘‘add-on’’ reduction trajectory with little
crossover in reduction stages or byproducts with the ‘‘base’’
reduction sequence represented in the cave (see Moore, 2003).
How does the lithic technology at Liang Bua relate to H. ﬂoresiensis and H. sapiens? The continuity in reduction sequence
through the Holocene may imply that modern humans were
responsible for all of the stone tools at Liang Bua. In this scenario,
the Holocene changes reﬂect adaptational shifts by modern
humans and H. ﬂoresiensis did not make stone tools. This possibility
introduces several interpretive challenges. First, the scenario
implies that modern humans were present at Liang Bua by at least
95 ka, more than doubling the ca. 45 ka appearance of H. sapiens
elsewhere in the region (O’Connell and Allen, 1998, 2004). Given
the technological similarities between stone tools in the Liang Bua
ﬂoor deposits, stone tools adhering to the 190–130 ka Liang Bua
wall deposits (Westaway et al., 2007), and stone tools at the 840 ka
Mata Menge open site (Brumm et al., 2006), an even earlier arrival
date is possible, close to (or before) the origin of modern H. sapiens
in Africa ca. 160 ka (White et al., 2003). Second, there is no evidence
for change in the stone toolkit at Liang Bua for at least 80 k.yr. and
no clear Pleistocene evidence of modern human behavior (see
McBrearty and Brooks, 2000; Wadley, 2001; Henshilwood and
Marean, 2003); such evidence ﬁrst appears after 11 ka. And third,
this scenario is contradicted by the distribution of hominin skeletal
remains in the cave.

To date, exclusively H. ﬂoresiensis skeletal remains have been
recovered from the Pleistocene stratigraphic units at Liang Bua,
predating 16.6 ka. H. ﬂoresiensis skeletal elements were recovered
in direct association with stone tools in Unit 4 (dating to ca. 69 ka,
74 ka, and 74–95 ka) and Unit 7 (multiple date ranges between ca.
17.1 ka and 19 ka) (Morwood and Jungers, 2009: Table 1). Exclusively H. sapiens skeletal remains have been recovered from the
Holocene stratigraphic unit, postdating 11 ka (Morwood et al.,
2004, 2005, 2009). The contextual evidence suggests that the pre12 ka artifacts were made by H. ﬂoresiensis and the post-11 ka
artifacts were made by H. sapiens. This is the most parsimonious
way to relate the stone tools and other archaeological evidence to
hominin species. H. ﬂoresiensis wrist structure does not preclude
stone tool manufacture and use (Tocheri et al., 2007:1745).
In this scenario, the stone artifact variations that appear at Liang
Bua in the Holocenedthe greater use of the freehand technique in
unifacial series, the increased use of chert, the increased amount of
burned debris, the appearance of edge-glossed chert ﬂakes, and,
later, the addition of rectangular-sectioned adzes to the reduction
sequencedare the result of activities by H. sapiens at Liang Bua.
Conversely, the cave occupation by H. ﬂoresiensis was marked by ca.
80 k.yr. of technological stasis, an extension of stoneworking
practices dating to at least 840 ka on Flores (Brumm et al., 2006).
The technological continuities that occur from the Pleistocene right
through the Holocene at Liang Bua imply that H. ﬂoresiensis and
H. sapiens shared a similar reduction sequence.
The synthetic view that emerges from our analyses suggests that
H. ﬂoresiensis and H. sapiens shared a similar reduction sequence at
Liang Bua, raising intriguing questions about the prehistory of
Flores. For example, we might ask how such phylogenetically
distant hominin populations came to share the one reduction
sequence. It is important to note that a shared reduction sequence
among hominin taxa is not without precedent: early H. sapiens and
H. neanderthalensis shared a common reduction sequence in the
Levant (Henry, 2003). The latter case apparently reﬂects a shared
technological history after divergence from a common ancestor.
Technological continuity was maintained from such a remote
period because the two hominins were adapted to the environment
in similar ways (Shea, 2003:177–178).

The Levantine pattern contrasts with the European situation
where cognitively modern H. sapiens evolved elsewhere and
subsequently encountered resident groups of H. neanderthalensis.
In Europe, interactions between these closely-related hominin
species may have stimulated the production of symbolic objects
such as beads, pendants, and other bodily ornaments among
cognitively modern humans (d’Errico, 2003:196). Conversely,
Neanderthal populations may have adopted the technologically
more complex stone toolkit of the modern human colonizers.
Indeed, imitation of colonizers’ ‘‘advanced’’ behaviors by ‘‘indigenous’’ groups is said to be ‘‘inevitable and totally predictable’’
(Mellars, 2005:21).
The Indonesian situation contrasts starkly with both the European and Levantine cases. H. ﬂoresiensis and H. sapiens evolved in
isolation from one another, resulting in an extreme divergence in
body morphology. The stone ﬂaking technology practiced by early
modern H. sapiens outside of Southeast Asia (see Mellars, 2006)
differed signiﬁcantly from the Oldowan-like stone technology in
early Flores assemblages (Brumm et al., 2006; Moore and Brumm,
2009). Given that the Flores reduction sequence dates to 840 ka
(Brumm et al., 2006), H. sapiens colonizers evidently converged on
the indigenous way of making stone tools.
Modern humans colonized Australia by 45 ka (O’Connell and
Allen, 1998, 2004) and H. ﬂoresiensis was extinct at Liang Bua by
17 ka; the two species were contemporaneous in the wider region
for nearly 30,000 years. This long period of overlap provided
opportunity for mutual observation and the adoption by H. sapiens

of the endemic way of making stone tools. Indonesia is unique in
the contemporaneous occupation of modern H. sapiens and an
evolutionarily remote relative and this may be crucial for understanding early modern human adaptations in this part of the
world.
Conclusions
The combined stone tool and hominin skeletal evidence at Liang
Bua suggests that the reduction sequence of Pleistocene H. ﬂoresiensis persisted through the Holocene occupation by modern H.
sapiens. Modern humans integrated this reduction sequence with
new behavioral patterns that reﬂect major adaptive changes, as
seen in the appearance of edge-glossed ﬂakes, the shift in raw
material selection, and the more intensive use of ﬁre. The arrival of
modern humans on Flores was not marked by a disjunction in stone
reduction sequence (e.g., Foley and Lahr, 1997, 2003; Mellars, 2006),
but by a suite of new and rather less ‘‘diagnostic’’ non-knapping
behaviors.
Rectangular-sectioned chert adzes were produced in the vicinity
of Liang Bua from about 4 ka, but not inside the cave. They were

made by indirect percussion in a series of reduction stages (Moore,
2005:183–184). This adze-making trajectory was an add-on to the
base reduction sequence practiced in the cave. Add-ons like this are
not unique to Flores or to adzes. Other add-on technologies in
Southeast Asia include backed and unifacially retouched points on
Java’s Bandung Plateau, backed microliths and bifacial points of the
Toalian Industry on Sulawesi, and widespread blade-making techniques (Presland, 1980; Bellwood, 1997). The same phenomenon is
seen in Greater Australia (Jones, 1977:192; e.g., Moore, 2003;
Brumm and Moore, 2005). Add-ons are not integral to the base
reduction sequence and spatial differences in tool production mean
that add-on reduction trajectories may not occur at every site. The
lithic technology does not look particularly ‘‘advanced’’ in Southeast Asia at sites where add-ons are absent (White, 1977).
Technological add-ons are perhaps the best proxies for early
modern human behavior in Southeast Asia. Bifacial axes, dating at
least to 30 ka in Greater Australia, are an example of a Pleistocene
add-on, but most other add-ons date to the Holocene when
a modern human presence is ﬁrmly established. The explosion of
technological add-ons in Holocene Australia and Southeast Asia is
similar to the marked increase in lithic types in Upper Palaeolithic

M.W. Moore et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 57 (2009) 503–526

Europe (Brumm and Moore, 2005). A simple stone technology
occurring on a sitedthe absence of technological add-onsddoes
not necessarily mean that the hominins responsible were phylogenetically ‘‘primitive’’ or cognitively challenged; add-ons are sufﬁcientdbut not necessarydevidence of modern human behavior
(Wynn and McGrew, 1989:384). Without technological add-ons,
the knapping practiced by modern H. sapiens at Liang Bua appears
similar to the African Oldowan (Moore and Brumm, 2009).
Simple reduction sequences like the one at Liang Bua are underresearched, in part because they are deemed ‘‘unexciting’’ (e.g.,
Gowlett, 1991:134) and involved ‘‘opportunistic’’ knapping techniques that were perhaps prone to historical convergence (Bowdler,
1992:16–17; Culotta, 2006). The trend towards unifacial reduction
among modern humans at Liang Bua suggests that variation can be
identiﬁed in simple reduction sequences. Variation like this may
prove immensely important in exploring stone tool making among
different hominins in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.
