This article uses a method that combines pedoanthracological and pedo-archaeological approaches to
terraces, complemented with archaeological pastoral data, in order to reconstruct the history of ancient
agricultural terraces on a slope of the Enveitg Mountain in the French Pyrenees. Four excavations
revealed two stages of terrace construction that have been linked with vegetation dynamics, which had
been established by analyses of charcoal from the paleosols and soils of the terraces. Pedo-archaeological
descriptions of these terrace soils reveal their ancient origins and their long-term use. Their chronology
was established by radiocarbon dating of single charcoal fragments and charcoal lenses originating in the
paleosols. Combining radiocarbon dating with pedo-archaeology resulted in a more reliable chronology.
Moreover, the Bronze Age was found to be a crucial period in the history of land-use. This study also
highlights the role of ﬁre in the construction of this land-use pattern.

1. Introduction
Soil terracing, present in most of the mountainous regions of the
world, is one of the most spectacular human modiﬁcations of the
landscape. The study of ancient agricultural terraces, in association
with their soils, represents an essential historical source and
enables a better understanding of the anthropic change of landscape (Sandor, 2006). This study combines pedoanthracological
analyses and pedo-archaeological descriptions of terrace excavations situated between 1600 and 2000 m altitude in the Eastern
Pyrenees. The aim is to reconstruct the history of terrace systems in
relation to the landscape and to land-use changes since the
Neolithic period.
As important as it may seem, soil terracing has been little
studied in Europe in a multi-proxy approach that combines geoarcheological excavations with pedosedimentary and chemical
analyses of elements from the terrace soil (palaeoenvironment and
archaeology). In Greece and southern France, Poupet (2000) and
Harfouche (2007) combined pedology and archaeology to shed
light on ancient agricultural terrace systems. In Italy, in Vislario,
Nisbet (1983) has studied agricultural terrace soils using pedo* Corresponding author. Tel.: þ34 935868092; fax: þ34 935812001.

archaeological descriptions, the micromorphology of paleosols,
and analyses of phytolith and charcoal. His study showed the
beneﬁts of this method for understanding the relationship between
terrace construction and landscape changes over time in a mountain system since the Second Iron Age.
Interdisciplinary approaches are more common in Latin America. In these studies, pedology allowed them to detect paleosols or
BT horizons that indicated the ancient origins of agricultural terrace
systems.
In the Peruvian Andes, Sandor and Eash (1991, 1995; Sandor,
2006) have shown the interest of complementing the pedological
descriptions of terrace soils and paleosols with radiocarbon dates of
charcoal from these paleosols. This information, placed within the
surrounding archaeological context, enabled them to reconstruct
the agricultural history of the Colca Valley. When successive paleosols can be observed (Chicha-Soras Valley), radiocarbon dating of
charcoal extracted from paleosols provides information about
phases of use, abandonment and reconstruction of the terraces
(Kemp et al., 2006) at different cultural periods.
It is also possible to identify cultivated plant species through
different methods: 1) palynological analyses carried out on a sedimentary sequence situated close to the terraces (Branch et al.,
2007); 2) stable carbon isotopes present in organic matter (Webb
et al., 2004); 3) pollen, phytolith and diatom analyses in the

1786

terrace soil (Trombold and Israde-Alcantara, 2005). This latter
study in Quemada, Mexico, also localized the cultivation of
different agricultural products (Agave, Oppuntia and Zea mays) in
the upper and lower parts of the entire terrace system.
The question of the chronology of agricultural systems is a key
part of these articles, which highlight the difﬁculty in obtaining
precise dating of the construction and use of terraces. These
uncertainties are essentially linked to the reworking of soils and
paleosols before their protection and, therefore, the reworking of
elements that they contain, i.e. charcoal and pottery. One article in
particular (Borejsza et al., 2008) focuses on the establishment of
a chronology of agricultural terrace systems and colluvium deposits
of La Laguna in Mexico. The chronology of these terraces was
obtained by describing their pedosedimentary history and by using
radiocarbon dating and the OSL method (Optically Stimulated
Luminescence).

Our study in the Pyrenees (Fig. 1) treats: 1) excavations which
systematically revealed two generations of terraces as evidenced
by paleosols connected with buried terrace walls, 2) the
movement of charcoal in these soils and the use of charcoal
radiocarbon dating to reconstruct chronology, and 3) the relationship between vegetation dynamics, the role of ﬁre, and
ancient agro-pastoral activities. The results emphasize the
importance of the Bronze Age period in the anthropic shaping of
the mountain landscape. Finally, we propose a taphonomical
model to shed light on the relationship between charcoal and
paleosol.
2. Study area
The study area is located in the Eastern Pyrenees, in the
Cerdagne region (Fig. 1), which is a vast plateau surrounded by

After the high altitude plateau of Maura and La Padrilla
(2300 m), which was leveled out by ﬂuvioglacial erosion, the
mountain slopes down gently forming a nearly ﬂat zone at an
altitude of 2100 m called the Pla de l’Orri. There is a peat bog in the
center which has been the subject of palynological analysis (Galop,
1998). The soils found there are not highly differentiated, such as
rankosols and thicker soils such as brunisols. The environment is

mountains at 100 km west of the city of Perpignan. Annual mean
precipitation is 637 mm.
The Carlit Mountain range is a granite relief that dominates the
plateau and reaches 2921 m in altitude. The Enveitg slope forms
the western part of this mountain range, and is oriented towards
the south. The Enveitg slope is 2000 ha in size and ranges from
1200 to 2600 m in altitude (Fig. 2).

covered with grass, with occasional Juniperus communis, Juniperus
nana, Pinus uncinata and Cytisus purgans.
Between 2100 and 1900 m, the slope becomes steeper and
reveals large blocks and boulders of granite lodged in the granite
sand. On these soils, which are thinner and poorer in organic matter
(lithosols), the vegetation that has developed is composed of
P. uncinata, J. communis and J. nana, C. purgans, and Calluna vulgaris.
At 1900 m, l’Orri d’en Corbill is a small pass with a gentle slope
where rankosols developed, enriched by sediment from the slope.
At the bottom of the slope, near the Brangoly stream, between 1500
and 1700 m, is a zone of large meadows enclosed by drystone walls
called Devesas del Cavaller. These meadows have been re-colonized
by C. purgans, J. communis and J. nana, Ilex aquifolium, Rosa canina,
Salix cf pirenaica, P. uncinata and Pinus sylvestris, and Rhododendron
ferrugineum. The terraces excavated in this study are located at
l’Orri d’en Corbill and Devesas de Cavaller.

pastoral indicators and cereal percentages increase again from
500 cal AD (1450 cal. yr BP). At an altitude of 1900 m, carpological
analysis revealed the presence of rye seeds in a hut from the Early
Middle Ages (Ruas, 2003). This evidence and the presence of
ancient terraces suggest that local agriculture existed during this
period.
During the High Middle Ages (1200–1450 cal AD (750–500 cal.
yr BP)), massive forest clearings changed the landscape, which then
came to resemble its current state. Forest taxa reached its lowest
percentage, while archaeological and palynological data show that
the mountain economy was increasingly specialized in pastoral
activities.

3. Archaeological context and vegetation history

Pedoanthracology was deﬁned by Thinon (1992) and developed by Carcaillet and Thinon (1996) with the aim of studying
vegetation dynamics from the Holocene (Thinon, 1992; Talon,
1997; Carcaillet, 2001a,b) using charcoal originating from mountain soils undisturbed by man (and thus the exclusion of archaeological contexts) (Thinon, 1992). Usually, pedoanthracological
samples are taken every 5–10 cm, from the bedrock towards the
surface of the pit, after having made pedological descriptions of
the varied soil horizons. Any colluvium or bioturbation traces are
also noted.
The case of terraces is different, as their soils are greatly
disturbed. More often than not, terrace construction begins with
the building of a wall on the substrate, followed by back-ﬁlling of
the gap between the wall and slope. On the one hand, the disturbance of soils connected with the construction of the terrace also
results in the disturbance of the charcoal in these soils (Sanborn
et al., 2006; Kemp et al., 2006). Yet, on the other hand, the
construction of a wall leads to the accumulation of charcoal
connected with the various phases of exploitation, abandonment,
or re-use of the terrace. This mixture of charcoal from multiple
phases means that a particular methodological approach is
required. Archeo-pedological descriptions of soils and paleosols
from the terraces reveal their construction methods as well as longterm changes. These descriptions allow a charcoal sampling
methodology to be developed and an analysis of the radiocarbon
dates from charcoal to be done on a case-by-case basis. Examining
the origins of the charcoal and its preservation in this geoarchaeological context is indispensable for constructing a hypothetical model of the agricultural use of these terraces in relation to
the changing vegetation dynamics since the Neolithic period.
The charcoal mass (¼speciﬁc anthracomass, AM) is expressed as
mg of extracted charcoal per kg of dry soil fraction ﬁner than 5 mm,
excluding stones.

The terraces analyzed here are located within a pastoral zone in
which archaeological research has been ongoing for 20 years.
At ﬁrst, these excavations focused exclusively on pastoral sites at
high altitude. Surveys have revealed 58 sites. 18 of them (spread
among 1900, 2100, 2200 and 2350 m in altitude) have been excavated (Fig. 2). They documented 49 levels of occupation which
range from 5700 cal BC (7650 cal. yr BP) to the present day (Rendu,
2001, 2003). Three peat bog cores were extracted at altitudes of
2100, 2200 and 2350 m for sedimentary charcoal and palynological
studies (Galop, 1998; Vannière et al., 2001). Results were compared
to the archaeo-anthracological and carpological studies of pastoral
site layers (Davasse et al., 1997; Ruas, 2003).
The Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites, dating from 4200 to
3200 cal BC (6150–5150 cal. yr BP), are located at 2100 m and ca.
2300 m at the limit of the ancient timberline, and seem to correspond to a bipolar system using mid-altitude forest clearances and
alpine pastures. Increases in pollinic pastoral indicators (Plantago
lanceolata, Rumex and Artemisia, Cichorioideae, Chenopodiaceae)
and ﬁre frequency show that forests were cleared for pastoral landuse (Galop, 1998; Vannière et al., 2001) from ca. 3000 cal BC. This
ﬁrst expansion of grazing land has since been conﬁrmed in other
sites in the Pyrenees (Galop, 2006; Miras et al., 2007).
The Bronze Age (around 2200–800 cal BC; 4150–2750 cal. yr BP)
at Enveitg is marked by an increase in the ﬁre frequency (Vannière,
2001) and in pollinic pastoral indicators (Galop, 1998). Deforestation concerned primarily the medium altitude forest, and some of
the pinewoods at higher altitudes. This anthropogenic impact was
accompanied by the construction of large structures. For example,
at 2100 m, site 88 (1800–1200 cal BC; 3750–3150 cal. yr BP) appears
more likely to have been a summer farm than a simple shepherd’s
hut. Data obtained from the western Pyrenees (Calastrenc et al.,
2006; Rendu et al. in press) and in the Alps (Walsh et al., 2005)
also conﬁrm that the Bronze Age was a signiﬁcant period of
anthropic construction of mountainous slopes. Previous research
has only considered this high level of Bronze Age organization from
a pastoral point of view. However, the data presented in this article
allows for a more complex understanding of the interactions
between agrarian and pastoral practices.
The period 500 cal BC–400 cal AD (2450–2350 cal. yr BP; Iron
Age and Antiquity) is marked by a continuous decline in pastoral
indicators, well under way from 900 cal AD (2850 cal. yr BP)
onwards, and by a long phase of pine re-colonization (Galop, 1998).
Pastoral sites were rare and agro-pastoral activities appear to have
relocated to the foothills. Two charcoal kilns found at 2100 m
altitude, between 100 cal BC and 200 cal AD; 2050–1750 cal. yr BP),
reveal pinewood exploitation, probably for metallurgy. Pollinic

4.2. Sampling
The four pits discussed in this article were chosen from among
eleven pits that were excavated along an altitudinal transect (Figs. 2
and 3).
Seven of these correspond to terrace pits, all of which present
a paleosol and a buried terrace. Among the seven, three (Cerd5Cerd5bis, Cerd6 and Cerd13) are situated between 1600 and 1700 m
altitude at Deveses del Cavaller, on the west-facing slope; three
(Cerd3bis, Cerd11 and Cerd9) were excavated at 1900 m altitude at
Orri d’en Corbill, on the south-facing slope; two of them were dug
at 2100 m altitude at Pla de l’Orri (also on the south-facing slope),
one of which was in an archaeological context (Cerd7) the other on
pasture ground (Cerd8).

organo-mineral horizon of this paleosol contains a large quantity
(mass) of charcoal. Two or three sample levels were deﬁned in the
paleosol: one level, situated deep in the horizon of decomposition
and alteration of the granite bedrock (horizon C); and one or two
levels in the organo-mineral horizon of the paleosol. The terrace
soil, which had undergone a new pedogenesis since covering the
paleosol, has also been divided into two to three sample levels. The
samples were taken from the base towards the surface of the pit in
order to avoid contamination between levels. Each section was
described using the pedological referential of AFES (1995).
4.3. Charcoal extraction and radiocarbon dating

Fig. 3. An example of terrace excavation at 1900 m altitude. (A): Alignments of stones

Another pit was excavated on pasture soil (Cerd2) at 2350 m
altitude. Lastly, the pit Cerd12 at Orri d’en Corbill is located uphill
from an ancient enclosure wall; two charcoal kilns were found in
this pit buried underneath more than 1.50 m of sediment.
The four pits discussed in this article are the most representative
of the excavations conducted on terrace soil, namely: Cerd6, Cerd5Cerd5bis, Cerd13 and Cerd3bis.
The pits (ca. 2  4 m) were excavated by mechanical shovel from
the front towards the back of the terrace. In two cases (Cerd3bis and
Cerd13), the pit openings were widened (to 20 m2) to verify
whether stones found in the proﬁles corresponded to walls. Clear
alignments of stones were found which are consistent with
a buried terrace.
Sample levels were deﬁned according to pedo-archaeological
descriptions of altitude terraces (Harfouche et al., in press;
Harfouche and Poupet, 2004). All the pits excavated on the
terraces show the same proﬁle characterized by a paleosol connected to a buried terrace which lies under the current terrace. The

Charcoal extraction was performed by ﬂotation. This operation
is carried out using a column of sieves of different mesh sizes (5; 2;
0.8 and 0.4 mm). A binocular microscope is used for sorting, in
order to extract the charcoal to be identiﬁed. Charcoal was
observed under an incident light microscope (100x, 200x, 500x)
and was identiﬁed in reference to the literature (Jacquiot et al.,
1973; Schweingruber, 1990) and to a charred wood reference
collection. Charcoal fragments impossible to identify were ascribed
to ‘‘n.id.’’ or ‘‘vitriﬁed.’’ ‘‘Vitriﬁed’’ charcoals are those that have
reﬂective properties like a mirror and have no visible anatomical
structure (Touﬂan and Talon, 2009). For the moment, the way they
are produced is unknown.
Twelve samples from terrace excavations were dated by AMS 14C
(Table 1). Each date corresponds to one fragment of charcoal. AMS
14
C dating was carried out at the VERA laboratory (Austria) and the
POZNAN laboratory (Poland). The dates were calibrated as BP and
as AD/BC by the CALIB program (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) version
5.0 based on the data set Intcal04 (Reimer et al., 2004), and
reported as intercept with 2 sigma.

(Fig. 4, Table 2), 2 m deep, shows two superimposed terraces, the
ﬁrst one of which is buried and is connected with a 1 m thick
paleosol (Harfouche et al., in press; Bal, 2006, 2008; Bal et al., 2008).
The soil of the second terrace that covers the paleosol is developed,
indicating that it could be ancient. In the upper part of the paleosol,
a charcoal lens (99.9% of charcoal for a lens) was found that has
been preserved by a rapid arrival of sediment, which in turn has
undergone pedogenesis. This second organo-mineral horizon,
overlying the lens, also corresponds to the buried terrace. Six
sample levels were delimited within the pit. Level I corresponds to
the organo-mineral horizons, with Ah1 and Ah2 containing
a signiﬁcant root system. Level II corresponds to the eluvial horizon
E and is marked by biological activity featuring the presence of
Lumbricidae galleries and turricules. Level III is delimited by a redbrown BP horizon with more angular aggregates. Levels IV and V
were taken from the organo-mineral horizon 2bAh of the paleosol
which contained large quantities of charcoal. This last level was
further divided into two sample levels. Level VI corresponds to the
pedological horizon Sal. A few fragments of the charcoal lens
identiﬁed as Abies alba found at the surface of the paleosol were
sampled.
A ﬁrst test pit, Cerd5, situated at 10 m from Cerd6, also contained a charcoal lens of A. alba dated 4713–4528 cal BP at a depth
of 70–80 cm.
This observation led us to open a second pit in the same terrace,
Cerd5bis (Fig. 5, Table 3). It contains two stages of terraces much
like those found in Cerd6. The soil retained by the wall of the upper
terrace covered a paleosol corresponding to a buried terrace. The
whole of the pit was subject to ﬁve sample levels. The ﬁrst (from 5
to 20 cm) corresponds to both the surface organo-mineral horizon,
Ah1, and also to the underlying organo-mineral horizon, Ah2, in
which a highly developed root system as well as signiﬁcant biological activity were found. The second sample level corresponds to
the pedological horizon BP. Level III was sampled in the organo-

above the paleosol and part of the recent terrace soil, was chosen as
the second level. Level III corresponds to the organo-mineral
horizon of the paleosol. Level IV corresponds to an ancient E
horizon (ochre-orange color) and is dated earlier than the buried
terrace construction.
This level was covered by the organo-mineral horizon (2bAh) of
the paleosol. The 2bAh horizon was initially retained by the wall of
the buried terrace, but the wall later collapsed and the 2bAh
horizon slid over the top of the wall.
The pit Cerd3bis (Fig. 7, Table 5) revealed the same layout of two
successive terrace systems. However, the Ah2 horizon does not
correspond to a sudden addition of sediment but rather to a slow
process of accretion. This accretion process corresponds to sediment which slid down the slope and then differentiated, and
covered the buried terrace after abandonment. The ﬁrst sample
level (level I) corresponds to the surface organo-mineral horizon
(Ah1) and contains several roots and micro-roots. Level II, between

5.2. Pedoanthracological results
The ligneous paleovegetation was reconstructed from taxa
identiﬁcation and from current ecological characteristics of these
taxa (Thinon, 1992).
All sample levels contain charcoal, from the bedrock to the
surface horizon. Identiﬁcation to genus level is possible for charcoal
sized 0.4 mm. The two taxa most frequently identiﬁed are two
conifers: A. alba and P. silvestris/uncinata (present respectively in 19
and 30 levels out of 33 levels sampled for the nine pits). Between
1700 m and 2100 m, Ericaceae (C. vulgaris) and Papilionaceae
(genus C. purgans) appear respectively in 5 and 6 levels out of 33
analyzed levels. Three additional taxa appear only rarely: Corylus
avellana and Salix (cf pyrenaica) are present in only 1 level out of 33,
level III (2bAh) of the Cerd3bis, and Juniperus (communis and
J. nana) appear only in level II (Ah2) in the Cerd3bis pit. Unidentiﬁable charcoal is present in the sample levels corresponding to
paleosol organo-mineral horizons from the Cerd6 and Cerd3bis
pits. This charcoal cannot be identiﬁed because of their state of
preservation (altered structure). All taxa that have been identiﬁed
are also present today on the study site except for ﬁr (A. alba).
The pits present high total anthracomasses (ASM) (369 mg kg1
for Cerd5bis, 847 mg kg1 for Cerd13); some even extremely high
(3925 mg kg1 for Cerd6; 1330 mg kg1 for Cerd3bis). The pits are
characterized by a high proportion of charcoal in the organomineral horizons of their paleosols. In fact, these horizons
provide between 66% and 95% of the total anthracomass. Branch
et al. (2007) also highlighted the importance of charcoal-rich
horizons Ah and bAh corresponding respectively to the surface
horizon and to the paleosol of an agricultural terrace proﬁle situated in the Peruvian Andes. At 1700 m altitude in the shade, ﬁr
(A. alba) is present in Cerd6 and Cerd13 pits. Fir has not been
identiﬁed in the surface level (I; Ah1 and Ah2 horizons) of the

four levels of Cerd13, is absent from level V (base of 2bAh horizon)
of the Cerd6 pit and from levels II (BP) and V (C) of the Cerd5bis pit.
Vitriﬁed charcoal fragments were found in level III (BP) and level V
and VI of Cerd6. The best representation of ﬁr can be found in the
pedoanthracological proﬁles of Cerd6 and Cerd13, particularly in
the 2bAh horizons, which correspond to level IV and V of Cerd6,
(ASP: speciﬁc anthracomasses respectively 318 mg kg1 and
3444 mg kg1) and level III of Cerd13 (ASP of 534 mg kg1).

Charcoal extracted from the 2bAh horizon of paleosol (level III) of
Cerd5bis reveals a mixed population of ﬁr/pine with a dominance
of ﬁr (210 mg kg1 for A. alba against 32 mg kg1 for P. uncinata/
sylvestris). This tendency rapidly diminishes and inverses in the
surface levels (A. alba: 11 mg kg1 in level II (BP) and P. uncinata/
sylvestris: 65 mg kg1 in level I, (Ah1 and Ah2 horizons)) (Figs. 4–6).
At 1900 m altitude on the south-facing slope, pine and ﬁr are
present throughout the Cerd3bis pit (Fig. 7). Ericaceae and Papilionaceae (essentially small branches) have been identiﬁed in the
2bAh horizon of the paleosol and in the surface levels. Juniperus
appears only in level II (Ah2), hazel (C. avellana) and willow (Salix
(cf pirenaica)) were only identiﬁed in level III (2bAh). A signiﬁcant
proportion of unidentiﬁable species come from this same level. The
vitriﬁed charcoal fragments are poorly represented at the base (Sal)
of the Cerd3bis proﬁle. At this altitude, pine trees are found in
greater abundance compared to ﬁrs throughout the whole of the pit
and particularly in the organo-mineral horizon of the paleosol
(2bAh) with an ASP of 786 mg kg1 for the Cerd3bis pit. These pines
are accompanied by shrub in this horizon and in certain levels
above.
5.3. Dating
Samples of two taxa (Table 1), P. sylvestris/uncinata and A. alba,
which dominate the assembling charcoal, were submitted for
dating. The dating range from 4767–4612 cal. yr BP to 1283–
1167 cal. yr BP (2817–2662 cal BC to 783–667 cal AD), i.e. from the
Chalcolithic to the late Middle Ages.
Nine out of twelve dates are situated between the Chalcolithic
and the Bronze Age (between 4767–4612 and 3362–3215 cal. yr. BP;
1412–1265 ca. BC). Out of these nine dates, six correspond to
charcoal (fragments or lenses) from buried terrace paleosols. Only
the Cerd3bis pit shows inversions in the age–depth relationship

between the dates of the charcoal found in the organo-mineral
horizon of the paleosol and the soil situated above. For the same
pit Cerd3bis, an isolated charcoal fragment identiﬁed as P. uncinata/
sylvestris originating from the 2bAh horizon of the paleosol is dated
during the transition Bronze Age/Iron Age (Vera-2951). Finally, the
most recent dates, Antiquity (Poz-17560) and late Middle Ages
(Poz-17564), correspond to charcoal found in the ﬁrst 25 cm of the
Cerd3bis and Cerd13 pits.

marks the end of the use of the paleosol. This end was nevertheless
temporary, since a new pedogenesis indicates a second phase of
usage of this same buried terrace. This change is dated during the
Bronze Age. The lens of A. alba from the Cerd5 pit dating from 4713
to 4528 cal. yr BP (2763–2578 cal BC) is situated at the base of the
2bAh horizon of the paleosol. In this case, the dating provides an
estimation that the bottom part of paleosol dates from the Chalcolithic. The 600–1100 years which separate these two lenses, as
well as the re-use of the buried terrace of Cerd6, indicate a continuity in the paleosol’s use and gives a coherent chronological
framework for the dates obtained from the other paleosols in
Deveses.
In fact, the dates obtained from isolated charcoal fragments in 1)
the 2bAh from Cerd5bis (3977–3823 cal. yr BP; 2027–1873 cal BC),
2) the center of the wall of the agricultural terrace of Cerd13 (4767–
4612 cal. yr BP; 2817–2662 cal BC), 3) in level IV (ochre-orange
horizon) which precedes the building of the wall (Cerd13: 4711–
4512 cal. yr BP; 2761–2562 cal BC) and 4) at Cerd6 within the BP
horizon just above the paleosol (Cerd6: 3978–3829 cal. yr. BP;
2028–1879 cal BC), are all situated within the chronological bracket
deﬁned by the dates of the two lenses (4800–3800 cal. yr BP; 2850–
1850 cal BC). This range cannot be determined with complete
certainty, however, because dates are established using charcoal
from wood which may have already been dead for a long time
before the ﬁre (Gavin, 2003). Radiocarbon dating can overestimate
the age of the event and this incertitude leads to classifying the use
of buried terraces within a wide chrono-cultural period: the end of
the Chalcolithic and the Bronze Age.
For the Cerd3bis pit, inversions of radiocarbon dating on charcoal from the 2bAh horizon contained in the buried terrace and
from the Ah2 horizon have been observed (Table 1). The date
4743–4569 cal. yr BP (Vera 2950; 2793–2619 cal BC), obtained from
a charcoal fragment from the Ah2 horizon, is dated 2000 years
before those obtained from charcoal from the 2bAh horizon (Vera2951: 2889–2768 cal. yr BP; 939–818 cal BC). Within the 2bAh
paleosol, the two dates are very far apart from each other: Vera2948 (2199–2117 cal BC; 4149–4067 cal. yr BP) and Vera-2951.

1794

M.-C. Bal et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 37 (2010) 1785–1797

These date inversions are due to colluvium phenomena that
resulted in a signiﬁcant reworking of the charcoal in the soil and
lead to even greater uncertainty regarding terrace dating (Sandor
and Eash, 1995; Kemp et al., 2006). There are, however, limits to
these re-workings: no charcoal is dated later than the end of the
Bronze Age (Vera-2951) in the Ah2 and 2bAh horizons. Moreover,
in all of the four pits, all the datings carried out on charcoal (fragments or lenses) from the paleosols connected with the buried
terraces range from the Chalcolithic to the transition Bronze
Age–Iron Age. The two most recent dates (Table 1) correspond to
charcoal originating from the surface horizon (Cerd3bis: Poz17560: Antiquity and Cerd13-Poz-17564: late Middle Ages). Even
though charcoal movements disturb the stratigraphy within each
soil (Carcaillet and Thinon, 1996; Carcaillet, 2001a; Carnelli et al.,
2004; Schwartz et al., 2005; Bal et al., 2008), it is possible to
consider that the assembling charcoal follow a stratigraphy linked
to the superposition of the paleosol and of the differentiated soil. In
addition, the results from radiocarbon dating are remarkably
consistent, since nine out of twelve datings give the same period of
Chalcolithic – Bronze Age.
6.2. Vegetation dynamics
In all of the pits, pedoanthracological analyses reveal the presence
of two dominant taxa, A. alba and P. sylvestris/uncinata, between 1600
and 1900 m altitude. In comparing plant dynamics, in all of the pits,
ﬁr- and pine-trees were observed in the deepest levels. Paleovegetation revealed by the assembling charcoal from the 2bAh
horizons of the paleosols show that at an altitude of 1600 m (Cerd5bis,
Cerd6 and Cerd13), the ﬁr-tree predominated in a mixed population
of ﬁr and pine, whereas at 1900 m at Orri d’en Corbill, landscape
vegetation was composed of pinewood accompanied by ﬁr (Cerd3bis). This vegetation proﬁle is similar to the one observed for the end
of the Iron Age until Antiquity in an archaeo-anthracological analysis
of pastoral huts excavated at the same location (Davasse et al., 1997).
At 2100 m at Pla de l’Orri, in three pits not discussed in this article, the
ﬁr-tree was not identiﬁed (Bal, 2006). This altitude corresponds to the
distribution of P. uncinata. Thus, all of the pedoanthracological
proﬁles are consistent with the theoretical altitudinal distributions of
taxa. Datings carried out on fragments of ﬁr and pine show that they
were present between 1600 and 1900 m altitude during the end of the
Chalcolithic Period and the Bronze Age (Table 1). Pine was present
during the Iron Age, Antiquity and the late Middle Ages.
The charcoal of superﬁcial horizons, which date from after the
abandonment of this ﬁrst generation of terraces, shows that this
vegetation transformation started from this period onwards.
At 1700 m altitude, as at 1900 m, the ﬁr-tree was always present,
but in smaller quantities, and the proportion of pine to ﬁr was
systematically inversed. Today, the ﬁr is no longer part of the taxa
present on the slopes studied here (but it can be found in the
nearby valleys). Throughout the entire Enveitg slope, these results
conﬁrm the dynamics previously described based on the pollen
record of Pla de l’Orri (Galop, 1998; Vannière et al., 2001). The
presence of the ﬁr-tree at Enveitg is documented from 7332 –
6686 cal. yr BP; 5383 – 4937 cal BC and it began to decline in ca.
5420–5321 cal. yr BP (3471–3372 cal BC, estimated age). The
pedoanthracological and the archaeo-pedological data make it
possible to link vegetation dynamics with the precise location of
human activities on the slope.
6.3. Reconstruction of an agro-pastoral landscape through charcoal
analysis at the end of Chalcolithic and during the Bronze Age
At the end of the Chalcolithic and during the Bronze Age,
terraces were built between 1600 m and 1900 m altitude. Fire

played a role in their construction and maintenance. The following
elements suggest that there was not only one ﬁre, but many: 1) the
organo-mineral charcoal-rich horizons of the paleosol; 2) the
nearby presence of two lenses, one situated at the base, the other at
the summit of one of these horizons (Cerd5 and Cerd6); and 3) the
dates obtained from charcoal. The succession observed at Cerd6
provides one possible model for human activity on the site: tree
clearing, terrace construction, exploitation, end of exploitation,
reforestation, ﬁre (presence of the lens), small sediment contribution (covering of the lens), followed by a new phase of activity that
always corresponded to the buried terrace. This model can be
interpreted in different ways: slash-and-burn, with short phases of
cultivation alternating with phases of reforestation, or perhaps long
phases of exploitation interspersed with periods of abandonment.
None of the evidence currently available enables us to privilege one
hypothesis over another. Whatever the exploitation pattern that
these terraces have undergone, the Bronze Age was a key period in
the construction of soils on the Enveitg Mountain. Moreover, this
importance of the Bronze Age period has also been shown by the
results of archaeological excavations of pastoral sites on the slope
(see above; Rendu et al., 2009). The high degree of organization of
these pastoral sites is similar to those of the ﬁrst generation of
terraces.
At the regional scale, the hypothesis of the complexity of agropastoral systems in the Bronze Age is further supported by the
data originating from the archaeological site of Llo. There, at
1600 m, regular cultivation is suggested by the carpological analysis
of carbonized seeds found in a Late Bronze Age dwelling. The
farmers developed an agro-pastoral system which associated hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare) and peas (Pisum sativum) (Ruas et al.,
2009). This system was also linked to the breeding of sheep, goats
and cattle and with a diversiﬁed production (Bréhard and
Campmajo, 2005). These data also suggest complex forms of
agro-pastoral exploitation.
The second generation terrace soils have not been protected by
post-deposit fossilization. It is impossible to date their use and to
estimate the time interval which separates the two terrace generations. No element of absolute chronology allows us to date the
cessation of exploitation on these superﬁcial terraces. Potentially
1000–2000 years old, the soils of these terraces are the current
soils. Archaeology, palynology, and historical sources distinguish
many phases of abandonment (Antiquity and the Late Middle Ages)
or expansion (Early and High Middle Ages and the modern period).
These sources also distinguish different kinds of exploitation:
possible slash-and-burn during the Early Middle Ages, grazeland
clearing by ﬁre during modern times, pastoral and meadow usages,
and occasionally potato crops at the beginning of the 20th century.
Pedoanthracology, however, reveals two long periods which
corresponds to two successive soils, marked by different dynamics
of ﬁre, vegetation, and sedimentation.
6.4. Taphonomical processes: charcoal production, dispersion and
preservation
6.4.1. Charcoal production
Charcoal, being the result of burnt vegetation, can be produced
by different sources. The primary sources are natural forest ﬁres
caused by lightning or anthropogenic in relation to agro-pastoral
practices (Carcaillet et al., 1997; Moore, 2000). Charcoal kilns or
hut ﬁreplaces, settlements situated on a slope, or any craft activity
employing wood as fuel also produce charcoal, whose dispersion is
possible after disassembling the structure. Charcoal can therefore
be found diffused in the surrounding soils. Concerning the terraces,
charcoal production can be linked to different practices. Fire is of
course used for clearing a space for terrace construction (Alcaraz,

M.-C. Bal et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 37 (2010) 1785–1797

1999), as well as for the maintenance phase or re-exploitation after
re-colonization by vegetation. Burning the vegetation can
contribute to fertilization of the ground (Sigaut, 1975). A third
situation also needs to be mentioned, not that of direct production
but of charcoal contribution through manure which includes ashes
and charcoal originating from the domestic hearth.
6.4.2. Dispersion and bioturbation
Charcoal then undergoes several processes such as dispersion
and bioturbation (Carcaillet, 2001a,b; Sanborn et al., 2006) that
contribute to their fragmentation and to their burial in the ground.
In the ﬁrst instance, wind and hydric erosion are responsible for
the rapid dispersion and deposition of charcoal on the surface of
the ground just after a ﬁre (Clark, 1988; Trabaud, 1989; Thinon,
1992; Lynch et al., 2004). Charcoal fragments larger than 0.4 mm
are generally not transported more than approximately 10 m
during a ﬁre (Ohlson and Tryterud, 2000), contrary to ﬁner particles
(around 100 microns) (Clark et al., 1998). However, the intensity of
the ﬁre, the production site’s geographical location, and the
weather conditions will determine whether one or the other will
predominate.
Bioturbation leads to the presence of charcoal at different soil
depths. This is generated by the action of Lumbricidae, of pararthropods, and of Formicidae which provoke the movement of
charcoal by the creation of galleries in the soil (Davidson, 2002;
Davidson et al., 2002). Numerous Coleoptera and larvae also live
in the interstices of the soil. Scarabaeoidea larvae can be found in
the Cerdagne soils at a depth of more than 40 cm. Bioturbation
caused by plant roots also signiﬁcantly affects the soil. The root’s
progression in the soil while growing can lead to the ﬁssuring of
certain bedrocks. They create channels and lead to the mixing of
diverse mineral and organic elements of the soil (Gabet et al.,
2003). When a root dies, it frees up a channel which can be
rapidly ﬁlled by the process of water inﬁltration. Roots participate
therefore in the fragmentation of charcoal by creeping inside the
anatomic structures (Thinon, 1992) as well as in their displacement
in the soil. The alteration horizons of the bedrock usually contain
charcoal, which proves the importance of burial. Vertical
pedological processes caused essentially by soil mesofaune favor
the incorporation of small pieces of charcoal into the surface
horizons.
All of these activities that contribute to the burial and the
fragmentation of charcoal (Thinon, 1992; Talon, 1997) can also
induce inversions in the relationship between the age of charcoal
and the depth of the sample (Gavin, 2003). For soils at altitude
above the timberline, the displacement of charcoal during transport by man (charcoal kiln production) is considered accidental
(Talon, 1997). The absence of anthropogenic reworking of the soil
also coincides with an absence of anthropogenic soil charcoal
displacement (for example, by activities linked to agriculture).
These movements are essentially due to soliﬂuction, colluvium
contribution, and bioturbation phenomena. Cattle trampling also
disturbs the organo-mineral surface horizons in highly pastured
zones.
The situation is completely different for terrace soils. They are
also subject to bioturbation and colluvium contribution
phenomena, but they are also highly reworked by human beings.
This reworking is however not total: the supporting wall is built
directly on the granite bedrock after having removed the soil, but
on both sides of this wall soil horizons can be preserved (Harfouche,
2007). Charcoal found in small quantities today in deep horizons,
especially in bedrock alteration horizons, probably originate from
ﬁres prior to the construction of the buried terrace.
The organo-mineral horizon of paleosols retained by buried
terrace walls represents the agricultural soil horizon of these

1795

terraces. For each of these excavated terraces, the ancient surface
horizon is rich in charcoal of a size greater than 0.8 mm, 2 mm, and
5 mm, with some being greater than 2 cm in diameter.
These pedoanthracological results obtained on the terraces can
be compared to those originating from soils undisturbed by
humans and situated in the same geographical context. Two
pedoanthracological pits excavated on pasture soil at 2300 m and
2100 m altitude, (Cerd2 and Cerd8 pits, not discussed here, Bal,
2006, p 97) contained very small charcoal fragments (sized
<0.8 mm), with a respective total anthracomass of 22 and 450 ppm.
Furthermore, their distribution in the soil is diffuse throughout the
proﬁle. Without neglecting bioturbation phenomenon, these
differences in size, quantity and dispersion of charcoal suggest that
the organo-mineral horizons of agricultural terrace paleosols
contain a large proportion of charcoal as a result of terrace usage,
which can therefore shed light on the type of soil management.
6.4.3. Uses of terrace soil
In order to identify the type of soil management, an analogue is
needed which would allow for comparisons between soils linked to
regular cultivation and soils resulting from slash-and-burn or
burning grazeland for cultivation. The addition of manure often
contains artifacts (shards of eroded ceramics) which have not been
found in this study area. Yet this does not mean that manure was
not added; it is possible that other fertilizing methods were used,
such as direct fertilization by the herds.
One hypothesis for explaining the signiﬁcant concentration of
charcoal in the organo-mineral horizon of paleosols is that of ﬁre
clearings. These ﬁres could play a role in complex technical and
temporal cycles, as discussed above. The soils covering the paleosols are related to a second terrace generation. For all of the
terraces, surface levels present much less charcoal than paleosol
surface horizons (for example Cerd6-level IV: 327 ppm; Cerd6-level
III: 19 ppm; Cerd6-level II: 1 ppm). The signiﬁcant differences in
anthracomass between paleosols and present soils represent two
anthracocoenoses revealing at least two different types of paleovegetation, chronologically separated by a sufﬁciently long time
lapse enabling the differentiation of the surface soil. The relative
poorness in charcoal of the present soil horizons can be related to
several phenomena, perhaps combined: 1) less tree cover, 2) less
use of ﬁre for agricultural purposes, 3) phases of pastoral use and 4)
a lower rate of post-deposition preservation.
6.4.4. Preservation
The covering over of paleosols results in remarkable charcoal
preservation. For terrace construction, covering took place by
colluvium contribution or by anthropogenic sediment addition.
This event could have happened very quickly, leading to the preservation of charcoal and charcoal lenses. In this case, the protection
would be maximal and therefore avoid transport and fragmentation of charcoal in the paleosol. When this process happens over
a longer period of time, elements at the surface of the soil are able
to undergo the diverse processes described in this article, i.e.
dispersion and bioturbation, before the paleosols were covered.
The quantity of paleosol charcoal alone, however, is not a sufﬁcient
indicator of the degree of protection, since quantity may be also
linked to ﬁre frequency or the duration of agricultural activities. It is
therefore necessary to complement the quantity of charcoal with
other elements: 1) a pedological description of the surface soil
which indicates its age; 2) the degree of charcoal fragmentation; 3)
the presence of charcoal lenses. At Cerd5 and Cerd6, the lenses
indicate that a rapid covering prevented their fractioning and their
dispersion. Furthermore, soils situated above the paleosols present
differentiated horizons which therefore indicate their age of at least
several centuries. Cerd13 and Cerd3bis also contain differentiated

1796

horizons. There is a difference, however, for the Ah2 and 2bAh
horizons of Cerd3bis which results partly from colluvium additions
containing charcoal of different ages. The preservation of charcoal
within this paleosol is more difﬁcult to interpret.
7. Conclusions
By combining pedoanthracological and pedo-archaeological
approaches, this study has demonstrated that:
- Charcoals from paleosol and/or soil of agricultural terraces are
good bio-indicators for reconstructing local vegetation
dynamics related to agricultural practices and for showing the
role of ﬁre in ancient agriculture.
- The two stages of terraces are linked to successive phases of
vegetation and correspond to different phases of construction
and use (other authors show a similar model in the Peruvian
Andes, Branch et al., 2007). For the moment, there is not
enough evidence to date the beginning of the usage of the
upper terrace.
- The Bronze Age seems to have been a turning point in the agropastoral construction, land-use, and transformation of the
mountain landscape.
- The progressive disappearance of A. alba, which has been
replaced by pine forest expansion in Enveitg slope since the
Chalcolithic.
- In order to more accurately date and reconstruct the history of
agricultural land-use, it is preferable to combine soil descriptions which estimate the antiquity of the terracing system with
radiocarbon dates from charcoal in the paleosol.
- A charcoal taphonomical model in this complex context helps
to disentangle the production and preservation of charcoal
within the two stages of the terrace systems.
