€ ningen is famous for the earliest known, completely preserved wooden
The Paleolithic site of Scho
weapons. Here we present recent results of an ongoing analysis of the nine spears, one lance, a double
pointed stick, and a burnt stick dating to the Holsteinian, c. 300 kyr. Macroscopic and microscopic analyses, as well as studies of thin sections, contribute to a better understanding of the manufacture of the
wooden weapons. They were deposited in organic sediments at a former lakeshore among numerous
bones of butchered horses. In general, the spears are extremely well-preserved and show no or little sign
of taphonomic alteration, although some of the weapons are broken and parts were slightly moved,
probably by water action. The excellent preservation conditions provide considerable information on the
operational sequence of production. The hunters selected thin trunks of spruce or pine and initially
stripped off the bark. Traces of cutting, scraping, and smoothing can be observed on the spear surfaces in
detail. In the case of spear X, repeated use of the weapon is implied by re-sharpening of the tip. Analyses
of wood anatomy provide information on climatic conditions and contribute to the better understanding
of the development of the site.

1. Introduction
Between 1994 and 1999 excavation in the open-cast mine of
€ ningen revolutionized our perspective on the Lower PaleoScho
€ningen 13 II-4, a series of wooden tools
lithic. At the site Scho
and weapons were uncovered together with several butchered
horse remainsdat least 35 individuals based on the number of
teethdon a former lakeshore (Van Kolfschoten, 2014). For the
ﬁrst time, unquestionable evidence for systematic large herbivore hunting with wooden spears was provided in Europe (e.g.,
Thieme, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2007). After ongoing discussions on the chronological position of the ﬁnd layer, new
chronometric data provided by the uranium-thorium method
and thermoluminescence (TL) dating places the site at c.

300 kyrs ago (MIS 9; Sierralta et al., 2012; Urban and Sierralta,
2012; D. Richter, pers. comm.). Here we attribute the ﬁnd layer
to the Holsteinian (Bittmann, 2012), being aware that the correlation of the Holsteinian with MIS 9 is controversial (Geyh and
Müller, 2005; in contrast e.g., Turner, 1998; de Beaulieu et al.,
2001).

On the basis of the dating results for Scho

duced and used the wooden implements were likely Homo heidelbergensis. However, it is also possible that early Neanderthals

might have been the makers of the Scho
(Stringer, 2012).
Pollen diagrams and numerous organic remains from different
layers at the lakeshore form a basis for the environmental
reconstruction and the evaluation of the role of plant use by the

that may have been used as hafting implements (Schoch, 1995;
Thieme, 1997, 2000, 2005, 2007). This paper summarizes evidence of ongoing research on the wooden artifacts from
€ ningen 13 II-4 together with the geological context of the
Scho
spears.
2. Materials and methods
€ ningen
Our study focuses on the wooden artifacts from Scho
13 II-4. Following excavation, the wooden objects were stored
in tubs with distilled water in the Lower Saxony State Service
for Cultural Heritage, Hannover. In 2012, the tools and weapons
were carefully conserved in the workshop of the RomanoGermanic Central Museum in Mainz, Germany, and since June
2013 they are on display in the research and exhibition center
€
€ningen site. The only exception is
PALAON,
neighboring the Scho
spear VII, which is preserved in its original condition in order
to allow future investigations. Information on the restoration of
the objects will be published elsewhere.
Before the restoration, the wooden tools and weapons underwent a process of detailed analysis. General photographic documentation of the artifacts, computer tomography (Somatom
Emotion, Siemens company), and a 3D spatial model of the spears
by laser scanning were carried out by the Arctron Company (www.
arctron.de). These operations were under the auspices of the Lower

Saxony State Service for Cultural Heritage in Hannover (Behrens
et al., 2007). Furthermore, W.H. Schoch described the spears in
detail using macroscopic and microscopic inspection under low
magniﬁcation by W.H. Schoch. After this part of documentation,
which included the collections of macroscopic photographs, he
collected small thin sections by hand with a razor blade. We were
able to conduct botanical identiﬁcation of the trees to genus or even
species level by comparing the bark with recent reference material
and by wood anatomy of central European species (Schoch et al.,
2004).

3. Results on the wooden artifacts from Scho
To date, we have identiﬁed the following worked wooden ob€ ningen 13 II-4 (Fig. 1, Table 1):
jects from Scho
- nine spears/spear fragments (spear IeV, VIIeX; spear fragment
IX uncertain)
- one lance (“spear VI”)
- one double pointed rod
- one burnt worked wooden stick.
Work is in progress on the analysis of smaller wooden remains
from this level. It is possible that the total number of worked
wooden objects will increase following completion of the analysis.

3.1. Find context and taphonomic aspects
The horizontal distribution of the weapons is limited to a
comparably small area (Fig. 2d) that corresponds to the hori€ hner et al., 2015).
zontal distribution of bones and ﬂint (see Bo
Except for two spear fragments (nos. VIII and IX) and the double
pointed stick, which were found further apart, the other
spears are concentrated in an area of c. 10  25 m at the former
lakeshore.
A conspicuous observation is that bigger wooden fragments in
the horizon 13 II-4 are often modiﬁed. Additionally, splinters of a
few centimeters in length were found here; work is in progress to
evaluate their context. The horizontal orientation of the weapons
does not show a uniform pattern. Two spears (V and VII) and the
lance (“spear VI”) lie next to each other with a similar northeastsouthwest orientation, while some meters to the north, spears III,
IV, and X lie in an east-west direction (Fig. 2d). It is possible that the
different orientations reﬂect phases of small-scale water action at
the lakeshore.
This observation is in accordance with evidence from the
vertical position of the ﬁnds. The spears from level 4 came from
the lower peat layer (4b), as well as the underlying chalk mud
or marl (4c). In the transitional layers between the peat and
marl there are peat-containing marls (4b/c) that cannot be
clearly separated. In layer 4a there were almost no ﬁnds. The
spears sometimes cross two horizons and reach from the
organic sediments (4b) down to the marl sediments (4c),

€ hner
suggesting small scale post-depositional movement (see Bo
et al., 2015).
At the time of discovery, the fragments of most weapons were
in the original, unchanged position (Figs. 2e7). Spear IV and V
were found in fragments scattered on a small area (Figs. 2d, 4a,
and 6a, b). The position of spear 4 was likely inﬂuenced by
post-depositional processes, given that it was found vertically at
45 (Schoch, 2007b). The spearhead fragment of spear V was
found horizontally turned by 180 degrees (Figs. 4a and 6b), so
that the spearhead pointed towards the spear shaft. This situation
was created either at the time of deposition by humans, or the
turning of the spearhead happened later but before ﬁnal sedimentation. It is also plausible that breakage of spear V was
caused by trampling.
In conclusion, the ﬁnd context suggests that the spears and the
lance were only marginally displaced after deposition by water
action and following some post-depositional disturbance. In
accordance with these results, the weapon surfaces provide a
unique state of preservation (Fig. 8) that allow detailed analysis of
the ﬁndings.
3.2. Dimension of the weapons
Most of the weapons were found in fragments but are complete (spears I, III, V; Figs. 1, 5a, d, and 6b) or nearly complete
(spear II and the lance “spear VI”; Figs. 1, 5b, c, and 6c and
Table 1) in their dimensions. Spears VII and X (Figs. 6d and 7c)

simply have a damaged base. On the other hand, some signiﬁcant
parts are missing from spears IV, VIII, and IX (Figs. 6a and 7a, b).
The identiﬁcation of the latter ﬁnd as a spear (spear IX) is not yet
completely veriﬁed.
The length of spears II, III, and the lance (“spear VI”) was
measured with the help of new equalized photographs. Measurements of the complete or nearly complete spears suggest that the
lengths of the complete weapons vary between 1.84 and 2.53 m
(Fig. 9). The preferred size of complete spears is between 2.1 and
2.4 m, while the lance is longer.
The maximum diameter of all weapons is between 2.4 and
4.7 cm. If we consider the complete pieces only, the maximum
diameter varies between 2.9 and 4.7 cm (Fig. 10). However, the
wooden ﬁnds were exposed to an enormous load of sediment and
glacial ice that led to minor secondary changes. The largest

diameter, and therefore the center of gravity, is always found at
the front of the shaft. Only the lance (“spear VI”) differs from this
scheme. The spears in their dimensions and design resemble
modern championship javelins (Rieder, 2001; Thieme, 2007),
which are c. 2.25 m (female type, c. 600 g) or 2.75 m long (male
type, 800 g).
3.3. Operational sequence
The anatomical analysis of the wood suggests that the choice of
material for the carving of the spears and the lance was standardized. In almost all cases the raw material was spruce. Only
spear IV deviates from that scheme as it is made of pine.
As the width of the tree rings of the spruce trunks are very small,
one can assume a slow growth of the wood and therefore probably

The analysis of small splinters of wood from Scho
II-4 is still in progress. However, it is possible that these may
indicate some processing of the spears on site. In the case of
spear X, reworking of the weapon can be demonstrated. The tip
is broken and several cut marks indicate renewal of the point.

cooler environmental conditions. The slow growth of the spruce
resulted in a particularly hard wood at the same time. In contrast,
the pine wood of spear IV shows signiﬁcantly wider tree rings that,
according to Schoch (2007b), speaks for a different habitat with
more favorable growing conditions.
We were able to determine the age or minimum age of the
trunks used for spear production (see Table 1, Fig. 11). Therefore, the
growing period can be demonstrated for up to 60 years and the
complete pieces indicate a preferred growing period of c. 50e60
years; only spear III is made of a much younger tree (33 years). The
lowest number of 18 tree rings is found in the incomplete pine
spear (no. IV). As far as it was possible to determine the season by
the character of the last tree ring, the spruce trunks were felled in
the summer months (spear III, V, VII), varying from early (spear II)
to late summer (lance “spear VI”).
All spears were made on thin trunks. After felling, all the bark
was completely stripped off and the underlying ﬁber (the inner
bark) mostly removed. Numerous knots were cut off as indicated by
the tool marks (Figs. 12 and 13).
The spear- and lance-heads were made using a ﬂint tool out of
the base of the trunks, an especially hard wood. The worked ends of
spears I and II show tool marks over a length of c. 60 cm, whereas
spear III shows tool marks at the point over 25 cm. Similarly, tool
marks are found on the spear bases of spear I and III, but only over c.
10 cm. The base of spear II was too damaged to identify any evidence for working.
The spear- and lance-heads were not made from wood at the
very center of the trunk, but instead from that slightly to the side.
This was done to avoid the central pith that, due to its lesser
hardness, is not suitable as a point.

The analyses demonstrate a sophisticated sequence of production steps implying experience in the manufacturing of
wooden tools and weapons. At ﬁrst glance, it might seem sur€ ningen decided to use spruce and
prising that the humans of Scho
pine as raw material for their artifacts since they are both rather
soft woods. Yew (Taxus), an elastic but hard wood, was the material of choice for the lance tip from Clacton-on-Sea, England and
the much younger lance of Lehringen, Germany (Warren, 1911;
Movius, 1950; Oakley et al., 1977; Thieme and Veil, 1985;
Buckingham et al., 1996). Similarly, yew was also used for bow
construction in the Neolithic, as seen at the site of Schnidejoch
(Hafner, 2010). Fragments of Taxus baccata have only been found at
€ningen 13 DB and 12 II-1. The chronological pothe sites of Scho
€ ningen 13 II-4,
sition of these sites is expected to be older than Scho
and thus yew was probably not available during the late interglacial times of the spear horizon, when cool and dry conditions
formed a rather open woodland landscape with species such as
birch and pine (Urban, 2007).
€ningen spears include: the
Common features of all of the Scho
use of small trunks as raw material, the removal of branches and
polishing of the surface, and the placing of the tip away from the
central axis of the trunk. These characteristics demonstrate a
high degree of sophistication in the production of the spears
(Haidle, 2009). Throwing experiments with replications
demonstrated that the spears are well-balanced and suitable for
hunting. In a range up to c. 35 m, the accuracy is enough to hit
larger animals. Penetration depth, thrown from 5 m distance
into a gelatinous block, lies between 22.5 and 25.5 cm and
would thus signiﬁcantly harm the animal (Rieder, 2000, 2001);
however, a short distance is more favorable to successfully hit
and penetrate the animal. The decentralized and, therefore
harder, tip prevents the spear from breaking (Schoch, 2007a).
€ningen spears can be
Based on these observations the Scho
identiﬁed as distance weapons, namely throwing spears. Of
course, a spear can also function for short distance attacks or
defense and is, along with ﬁre, an effective weapon against
€ningen 13 II-4, the
predators. In the open landscape of Scho
humans had to protect their prey and themselves against hyenas
and big cats (Serangeli et al., 2014). An occasional function as
digging stick is theoretically conceivable, but because of their
extensive length and the missing use-wear traces, the spears
were likely not made for this purpose. An application as distance
hunting and defense weapon seems more obvious.
The double pointed stick is less clear in its interpretation. The
curved stick is 78 cm long and the tip is decentralized in the same
manner as the spears. This kind of preparation is reminiscent of the
spears and it was carefully produced, but both ends are less pointed
than the tips of the spears.
Thieme (1997, 2007) argues for parallels between this object
and Aboriginal non-returning boomerangs or hunting clubs, and
interprets it as a weapon for hunting ducks in the high reed
vegetation along the lakeshore. It is also comparable with the
rabbit sticks of the Hopi, Apache, or Navajo of southwestern
North America. The range of these non-returning sticks lies

between 60 to about 200 m distance (Jones, 1997; Koerper,
1998; Koerper et al., 1998). The differences between boomer€ ningen
angs and rabbit sticks and the throwing stick from Scho
are the pointed ends. Besides the curved shape caused by
sediment pressure, it looks like a small spear. Considering the
shape, it could have been used as a digging stick. Hadza digging
sticks have sizes between 4 and 5 cm in diameter and
1.20e1.50 m in length. They get shorter during ongoing use
(Porr and Müller-Beck, 1997; Porr, 2008). Sandgathe and Hayden
(2003) point out that this so-called ‘throwing stick’ from
€ningen resembles ethnographic bark peelers. Whatever the
Scho
case may be, no traces of sediment abrasion or other use wear
on the tips of the artifact could be recognized. The idea of a
children's spear for practicing purposes is also possible. However, to date, no conclusive interpretation of this artifact can be
proposed.
€ ningen. BeThere are further unusual wooden tools from Scho
sides the double pointed stick mentioned above (Figs. 2c and 7d), a
burnt wooden artifact is remarkable and more wooden artifacts are
waiting for conclusive interpretation (Thieme, 2007).

The completely preserved weapons of Scho
outstanding and there are no direct parallels. The tip of a spear
found at Clacton-on-Sea in southeastern England was found about
100 years ago and probably provides the closest parallel for the
€ ningen ﬁnds (Oakley et al., 1977). The original 38.7 cm long
Scho
piece (Taxus) was collected in ﬂuviatile deposits and is supposed to
originate from interglacial deposits of the Hoxnian. The Hoxnian
can probably be correlated with MIS 11 (Bridgland, 1994; Ashton

et al., 2008; Schreve, 2012), which if correct would make the
spear from Clacton-on-Sea about 100,000 years older than those
€ningen.
from Scho
In 1948, a completely preserved lance was found at Lehringen in
lower Saxony. The weapon was made of yew (Taxus) and had a
maximum diameter of 3.1 cm and a length of 2.38 m. The lance is
dated to the Eemian (MIS 5e; 120 kyr) on the basis of pollen
analysis and was found neighboring or possibly inside the skeleton
of an elephant. Today the lance is poorly preserved (11 pieces),
however, a considerable number of details of the manufacturing
processdnotably the decentralized tipdcould be observed
(Thieme and Veil, 1985).
The site Cannstatt I, Stuttgart, Germany, offered a 2.2 m long and
4 cm thick wooden stick, broken in three pieces. It has a tip of 45 cm
and is made of acer (Acer campestre). The excavator describes it as a
possible lance. The wood was very fragmentary and it could not be
preserved (Wagner, 1995). The size corresponds with the di€ningen spears, but the very limited informamensions of the Scho
tion for the Cannstatt I object, which probably dates to MIS 7, makes
it difﬁcult to interpret as a wooden weapon (Wagner, 1995;
€ hner, 2012).
Serangeli and Bo
Possible wooden weapons were also reported from the site of
Bilzingsleben (Mania and Mania, 1998), which is dated to the Hol€ ningen 13 II
steinian and is probably about the same age as site Scho
(MIS 9). Unfortunately, the pieces are poorly preserved and closer
inspection is not possible. As with the Cannstatt I object, the
wooden objects from Bilzingsleben are difﬁcult to interpret given
the vague evidence.

Recently, Gaspari et al. (2011) reported a stray ﬁnd from
Ljubljansko Barje, Slovenia which they claim to be a weapon
from the Middle Paleolithic. The ﬁnd is much better preserved
than those from Cannstatt and Bilzingsleben, but, in our
opinion, the piece does not show convincing evidence of wood
processing.

€ningen spears and lance, the tip of Clacton-onOnly the Scho
Sea, and the lance of Lehringen (Eemian) provide clear evidence of Early and Middle Paleolithic hunting weapons in
Europe.

Considering the remarkable number of ﬁnds at Scho
II-4, the site likely represents the repeated hunting of horses. The
lakeshore attracted both animals and humans, but it was not by
accident that hunting took place at this speciﬁc location. During
MIS 9 (probably Holsteinian) the site was located at a narrowing
between the lakeshore and the uplands of the Elm (Lang et al.,
2012: Fig. 12b), providing a favorable area for hunting migrating
horses. The geographic setting could have allowed the hunters to
force the horses towards the lakeshore making them easier to
attack. The wooden weapons and the location of the site support
the idea that experienced humans carried out hunting activities
€ningen around 300,000
with signiﬁcant planning depth at Scho
years ago.
