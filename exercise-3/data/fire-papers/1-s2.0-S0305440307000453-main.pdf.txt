Abstract
The presence of many phytolith-rich layers in late Bronze and Iron Age deposits at Tel Dor, Israel, are indicative of specific locations where
plants were concentrated. Detailed studies of six of these phytolith-rich layers and associated sediments from Tel Dor show that the phytoliths
were derived mainly from wild and domestic grasses. The most common domestic grass was the cereal Triticum aestivum (bread wheat). Three
of these layers have a microlaminated microstructure, associated dung spherulites and phosphate nodules; characteristics that all point to the
phytolith-rich layers having formed from dung in animal enclosures. In two of the layers, the microlaminated structure is absent while dung
spherulites and phosphate nodules are present, suggesting that these too originate from dung that was not deposited in an enclosure. The sixth
layer is microlaminated but does not contain spherulites. We thus cannot suggest a parsimonious explanation of its observed properties. Concentrations of burnt phytoliths are present in three locations, implying that dung was either burnt in situ or the ashes from burnt dung were redeposited. The transformation of dung accumulations into phytolith-rich layers involves a loss of organic material and hence a significant
reduction in sediment volume, which is clearly apparent in the stratigraphy of some of the locations examined. The volume reduction can
be observed in the macrostratigraphy and has important implications with regard to macrostratigraphic interpretation. The presence of abundant
phytolith-rich layers on the tell has significant implications for the concept of ‘urbanism’ during these periods.

A systematic study of the sediments from the Late Bronze
and Iron Age periods at Tel Dor (Israel) revealed the presence
of numerous white layers, whose major component is opaline
(siliceous) phytoliths. These layers vary in thickness from
millimeters to 30 or so centimeters. They can extend laterally
for meters. Shahack-Gross et al. (2005) studied two of these
phytolith-rich layers that accumulated within a monumental

58

building of the early Iron Age above the southern harbor. They
cover the entire space investigated (part of either a room or an
open courtyard) and vary in thickness from a centimeter or so
to about 10 cm. Prior to this study, these layers were thought to
be lime-plaster floors. Micromorphological and phytolith analysis showed that they are composed almost entirely of phytoliths from grasses. The sediment microstructure revealed
a wavy lamination, indicative of trampling. Calcitic spherulites were also present. These are derived from the digestive
tracts of ruminants, including common domestic animals
such as goats, sheep and cows (Brochier et al., 1992; Canti,
1997, 1998, 1999). Shahack-Gross et al. (2005) concluded
that this space was used at some point in time in the early
Iron Age as an animal enclosure. The aim of this study is to
compare and contrast six different phytolith-rich layers at
Tel Dor in order to better understand the manner in which
they formed, their implications to site formation processes
and their significance to the archaeology of the site.
As phytoliths do not accumulate as such, but are always deposited together with the associated plant organic material, the
presence of these layers raises interesting taphonomic questions. Shahack-Gross et al. (2005) reported that the volume proportions of phytoliths to whole modern dung is about 1:50. The
reduction in volume that occurs when the organic matter is degraded is considerable. This compression of tell sediment over
time, can clearly influence the stratigraphy, can concentrate artifacts into smaller volumes and can juxtapose sediment layers
against walls that are lower (i.e. older) than the sediments.
It is reasonable to assume that almost all phytoliths were
brought to the tell while still an integral part of the plants in
which they formed. The organic fraction of the plants then degrades relatively rapidly, and the more stable fraction comprising, in the case of grasses, mainly phytoliths, remains.
According to Shahack-Gross et al. (2005) an accumulation
of a meter of plants would therefore reduce to about 2 cm.
The phytolith-rich layers we have examined also contain other
minerals such as quartz and clay. Thus, in general, the volume
reduction was probably considerably smaller.
Based on the studies of Shahack-Gross et al., (2003, 2005)
there are four main criteria for determining whether or not the
phytolith-rich layers are from animal enclosures: microlamination, dung spherulites, authigenic phosphate and the types
of phytoliths present.
1.1. Ethnoarchaeological background
As the phytolith-rich layers at Tel Dor probably form as a result of plant accumulations degrading or being burnt under domestic or industrial circumstances, one key to understanding
this phenomenon is from ethnoarchaeological observations.
These are mostly from agro-pastoral societies and unfortunately
not from urban contexts that could be more relevant to Tel Dor.
The most comprehensive ethnoarchaeological studies of traditional agro-pastoral societies in the Near East are from western Iran (Kramer, 1982; Watson, 1979) and to some extent from
Syria (Kamp, 2000; Roth, 1985) and Ottoman Palestine
(Ziadeh-Seely, 1999). Traditional agro-pastoral villages are

basically agglomerates of households (Watson, 1979; ZiadehSeely, 1999). Each household consists of an open courtyard
and roofed rooms. The rooms are used as the family living
room, kitchen, various storage rooms, and as stables for the
household’s sheep and goats. There are separate stables for cattle, donkeys and horses (Kramer, 1982; Ziadeh-Seely, 1999).
Goods stored are grains, straw, and dung cakes. The latter are
dried kneaded animal dung formed into flat ovals that are
used as fuel (N.F. Miller and P.J. Watson, personal communication; see also Miller, 1984; Reddy, 1998).
Based on the above, accumulations of large quantities of organic materials that could degrade into phytolith-rich layers
may occur in abandoned storage rooms (grain and its associated
chaff, straw, dung cakes) and in pits, as well as in open areas
within and around the site (mostly dung and its ash). As it is unlikely that grain, straw and dung cakes will be left unused, except
in cases of abrupt, unplanned, abandonment, the most likely material to form relatively thick phytolith-rich layers of either burnt
or un-burnt phytoliths is dung. Note that building with dung
today is mostly achieved by mixing dung with mud. This is
not expected to form phytolith-rich layers after degradation.
The phytoliths expected to be found in dung of animals maintained by an agro-pastoral society are mainly a mixture of wild
and domestic plants. The animals are usually herded away
from the site, feeding on wild vegetation, but their diet is supplemented by fodder of both wild and domestic plants. Moreover, it
is customary that agro-pastoralists grow plots of plants used as
fodder for their animals (e.g., barley in Iran (Watson, 1979); sorghum in India (Reddy, 1997); various legumes and grasses in Palestine (Turkowski, 1969)). In addition, stables are lined with
straw, and this is mixed with the dung. The herds often graze
on the stubble left in the fields after harvesting the crops. Dung
in ethnographic contexts is usually removed from the stables.
Other possible areas of accumulation of plant remains are
threshing floors, remains of matting and bedding, roofing of
thatch and bark and chaff-tempered mud plaster. Ethnoarchaeological studies emphasize that the straw and chaff (and of
course the grains) are collected from the threshing floor
(Kramer, 1982; Reddy, 1997; Watson, 1979; Whittaker, 2000).
Phytolith layers are therefore not expected to form on threshing
floors. This was indeed verified in an ethnoarchaeological study
in northern Greece (Tsartsidou et al., in press). Mats and mattresses made of straw would produce thin phytolith layers. Phytolith layers resulting from the decay of woven mats should be
composed of phytoliths from reeds or palms; plants known to be
used for matting in the Near East. Kramer (1982) also mentions
that roofs are lined with reed mats. Upon collapse these may
form thin phytolith layers composed of reed phytoliths in
a semi-oriented microstructure. Reeds or mats are also occasionally used inside mud-brick walls, to bind sections of the
wall and/or improve elasticity (Aurenche, 1981). In Uzbekistan
straw is placed beneath the roof presumably as insulation (E.B.,
personal observation). Bark can also be used for roofing (S.W.,
personal observation, Hunan Province, China). This too would
produce a distinctive assemblage of phytoliths and siliceous aggregates (Albert et al., 1999; Albert and Weiner, 2001; Schiegl
et al., 1996). Table 1 is a summary of the above data.

1.2. Tel Dor
Dor was a major port town on the eastern Mediterranean
coast (Fig. 1). Its earliest occupation dates to the Middle
Bronze Age IIA (ca. 2000e1750 BCE) and its tell was continuously and intensely settled until the Roman period (c. 250
CE). Until the building of an artificial port with Roman technology in nearby Caesarea, the natural bays south and north of
the tell were among the few natural anchorage points along the
central part of the eastern Mediterranean seaboard, which ensured the existence of a thriving urban center. This role of
a commercial entrepôt is most conspicuous in the early Iron
Agedone of the periods investigated in this paper. In contrast
to the humble insular material culture typical of this ‘Dark
Age’ in the Levant (and elsewhere around the Mediterranean),
Dor exhibits certain luxuries, some foreign contacts (with Philistia, Cyprus and Egypt, and to a certain extent with Greece),
and it displays dense urban architecture as well as monumental
public construction. In fact, architecture has been encountered
in every excavation area that reached the early Iron Age
strata. For more information on Tel Dor, see Gilboa (2005);
Gilboa and Sharon (2003) and Sharon and Gilboa (in
press) and a full bibliography at http://www.hum.huji.ac.il/
dor/bibliography.htm.
The study of phytolith-rich layers thus offers an opportunity
to learn more about the use of space both within and outside
buildings, and more specifically the manner in which vegetal
matter and dung were utilized.
2. Materials and methods
We investigated six phytolith-rich layers from the Late
BronzeeIron Age sequence of Tel Dor in addition to the two

studied previously from the early Iron Age monumental building (area D2, Shahack-Gross et al., 2005). They are located in
the following excavation areas (Fig. 1): two in area G, a series
of thin layers in area D5 and three in area D2. Table 2 lists the 32
sediment samples analyzed from these areas. They were collected from freshly exposed surfaces using a spatula and placed
in plastic vials. We also studied gray powdery sediments that in
two cases are juxtaposed to the phytolith-rich layers. For comparison we sampled brown quartz and clay-rich sediments in
layers above and/or below the phytolith-rich layers.
2.1. On-site analyses
We used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to
determine the identities of the major sedimentary minerals.
About 0.1 mg of powdered sample was mixed with about
80 mg of KBr, and a pellet was produced using a hand press.
FTIR spectra were collected at 4 cm1 resolution using a portable Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer
(MIDAC Corp., Costa Mesa, CA, USA).
In addition, bulk sediment samples were gently homogenized using a mortar and pestle and a grain mount was prepared using Entellan New (Merck) and examined using
a petrographic microscope (Nikon, Labophot2-pol).
2.2. Phytolith analyses
For each sample, a detailed morphometric, morphologic
and quantitative study of the phytoliths was performed to identify the types of plants, as well as the plant parts from which
the phytoliths were derived. We also address the complicated
question of whether or not the plants were from domesticated
or wild sources by comparing morphometric traits of the

phytoliths collected on-site to those of an off-site reference
collection.
Quantitative and morphological analyses followed the
methods of Albert et al. (1999). Slides were examined using
an Olympus BX41 optical microscope and digital images
were obtained using an Olympus Camedia C-5060 camera
and Olympus DP soft 5.0 software. The number of phytoliths
on the slide was counted and related to the original sediment
weight. For morphological analysis, a minimum of 200 phytoliths with diagnostic morphologies were counted in order to
obtain an error of around 20% (Albert, 2000).
Morphological identification of phytoliths was based on
standard literature (Brown, 1984; Mulholland and Rapp,
1992; Piperno, 2006; Twiss et al., 1969). When possible, the
terms describing phytolith morphologies follow anatomical
terminology, and otherwise they describe the geometrical

characteristics of the phytoliths. The International Code for
Phytolith Nomenclature was also followed where possible
(Madella et al., 2005).
Morphometric analysis of phytoliths is an effective tool for
differentiating between phytoliths produced by closely related
taxa (Ball et al., 1999; Berlin et al., 2003; Pearsall et al., 1995;
Zhao et al., 1998). We used ‘‘Motic’’ image analysis software.
Ten parameters (Table 3) were measured for the most distinctive inflorescence phytolith morphotype observed, namely
dendritic epidermal long cell phytoliths. Thirty phytoliths
were analyzed from each sample. We then conducted discriminant analyses (with SPSS for Windows), using calibration
data from the same species, following the methodology of
Ball et al. (1999) and Berlin et al. (2003).
We measured the refractive index (RI) of the mineral opal
in order to differentiate between burnt and unburnt phytoliths,

following Elbaum et al. (2003). Slides were prepared using
a refractive index medium of 1.440 which is the value that distinguishes burnt from unburnt phytoliths. The ratio between
the number of phytoliths with RI >1.440 and the number
with RI <1.440 was determined.
A small reference collection of seven modern grass species
(divided into their different parts, when possible) were collected in the summer of 2005 from the area of Tel Dor for
comparative purposes (Table 4). The methods used to prepare
this collection follow Albert and Weiner (2001).
2.3. Micromorphological analysis
Micromorphology was used to better understand the depositional context of each of the layers, and possible post-depositional changes. Undisturbed, oriented sediment blocks were
taken from the six localities listed in Table 2. Each of these
blocks included the phytolith layer under study and the sediments immediately below and above it. The blocks were

carved out of standing sediment profiles (baulks), coated
with Plaster of Paris in order to keep them intact, and embedded in polyester resin in the laboratory. The embedded blocks
were sawed into 5  7.5 cm sub-blocks from which 30 mm
thin sections were prepared. The thin sections were viewed using a polarizing light microscope (Nikon, Labophot2-pol) and
described following Bullock (1985) and Courty et al. (1989).
2.4. Analysis of dung spherulites
The number of calcitic spherulites present in each sample
was quantified (Table 2). The spherulite quantities in the archaeological sediments were compared to four modern dung
samples: two from cattle and sheep in northern Israel and
two from goats from southern Israel. The dung was ashed in
an oven at 550  C for 4 h. An accurately weighed aliquot of
ca. 1 mg was put on a microscope slide and counted under
the microscope as described above for phytoliths. The results
show that the spherulite concentrations in modern livestock

medial axis); width (minor dimension of the feature); equivalent diameter (diameter of a circle with the same area as the feature) and inscribed radius (radius of largest circle that can be drawn in the feature).

ashed dung.
3. Results
Table 2 lists the samples analyzed, their phytolith and
spherulite concentrations and major mineral components.
The refractive index (RI) ratio shows whether the phytoliths
are burnt or not.
3.1. Structure of the phytolith layers
Micromorphological observations show that phytolith-rich
layers may have two different microstructures; a microlaminated structure and an un-oriented, massive, structure
(Fig. 2a and b). The former often contains articulated phytoliths, mostly comprising long cells that form clearly defined
laminae. All layers include quartz silt and sand grains, clay
and calcite to varying extents. Some layers may be centimeters
thick (Fig. 2c), others as thin as 1 mm, and in some cases only
between 20 and 50 mm (Fig. 2d). Gray layers that are rich in
phytoliths are mostly massive with microlaminated domains.
They contain large amounts of microscopic charcoal. The gray
color is derived from the charcoal. They are thus a product of
burned vegetal matter (Fig. 2e).
3.2. Amounts and types of phytoliths
The sediments analyzed have phytolith concentrations ranging from 100,000 to 46 million phytoliths per gram. This can be
compared with the 18,000 and 30,000 phytoliths per gram in
two mud brick samples (Table 2). An analysis of the phytolith
morphotypes shows that in general between 40% and almost
70% of all the phytoliths in these samples are derived from
grasses (Piperno, 2006; Rosen, 1992, 1993; Rosen and Weiner,
1994; Twiss et al., 1969). The remaining predominant morphotypes include cylindroids and parallelepiped elongates with
smooth or rugose margins. These are characteristic of monocotyledonous plants in general, including sedges, palms, grasses
etc. (Albert, 2000; Bamford et al., 2006; Rosen, 1992; Twiss
et al., 1969). They are also produced in great numbers in the
leaves and stems of grasses (Bamford et al., 2006; Rosen,
1992; Twiss et al., 1969). As no phytoliths indicative of other
monocotyledonous families were observed in the samples,
and as some of the multicellular structures with smooth margins
had short cells from grasses attached, we assume that all the
phytoliths with these morphologies were also derived from
the leaves and stems of grasses. This implies that the proportion
of grasses in the samples analyzed is around 85% or more of all
the phytoliths. Phytoliths from the inflorescence of grasses constitute between 40 and 52% of all the phytoliths. This is a relatively large proportion and indicates that, at least in the contexts
investigated, whole plants (presumably without roots) were
brought to the site (or consumed offsite and deposited onsite
as dung or dung-products). A key question for understanding
the formation of these layers is whether or not the grasses
were derived from wild or domesticated plants.

The ratios of single-celled (individual) phytoliths to multi-celled phytoliths are also shown.

3.3. Differentiating between domesticated (cereals) and
wild grasses based on phytolith morphologies
This is particularly challenging as short cell phytoliths are
abundant in all the samples and they are all derived from the
Festucoid sub-family, which includes cereals such as barley
(Hordeum), wheat (Triticum) and oats (Avena). Most grass
phytolith studies to date focus on phytoliths from the inflorescence to identify the genus, and in some cases even the species. Rosen (1993) and Rosen and Weiner (1994) highlight
the importance of a detailed morphological study of papillae
cells in conjunction with the type of decoration from the
long cells to differentiate between Hordeum and Triticum in
the Near East. Piperno and Pearsall (1993) focus on the short
cells of maize in the tropical forests. Berlin et al. (2003) and
Ball et al. (1999) performed detailed morphometric studies
of long cells with echinate or wavy margins to identify different grass species.
Table 4 lists the reference grass species analyzed, the number of phytoliths per gram of dry organic material and the ratio
between individual (i.e., single-celled phytoliths) and multicellular (i.e., multiple-celled or interconnected phytoliths)
structures. The latter provides some information on the extent
of silicification of the different plants. A correspondence analysis of the different phytolith morphological types among the
modern species analyzed, shows that phytoliths vary morphologically depending on the plant part: stems, leaves and inflorescences (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the inflorescences of the
domesticated species are differentiated to some extent from
the wild species. This implies that there are morphological differences that can differentiate between wild and domesticated
grass plants. In general, inflorescences of grasses are represented by more than 40% long cells. In some cases such as
Triticum aestivum this percentage increases to 72%, and in
the wild grass Lagurus ovatus it is 11%. More than 67% of
the total long cells identified in the inflorescences have decorated margins (dendritic, echinate, wavy, verrucate, etc)
(Fig. 4a and b). The exception is Lagurus ovatus, where

most of the long cells identified have a smooth or rugose
margin. The remaining phytolith morphologies were prickles,
papillae and short cells (Fig. 4c and d).
In our limited reference collection, only long cells with
dendritic margins are characteristic of domesticated grasses,
with one exception (Hordeum marinum which is a wild grass).
Moreover, only Triticum dicoccum has interconnected cells or
multicellular structures with dendritic morphologies (Fig. 4e
and f). All the other phytolith long cell morphologies are present both in wild and domesticated grasses in different proportions. In our reference collection the proportion of long cells
with dendritic margins in domesticated cereals is 7e8% of
all the morphotypes present. Thus as a first approximation of
the proportions of domesticated and wild grasses present in
a given phytolith assemblage, we assume that 7e8% long cells
with dendritic margins implies that the grasses were derived
entirely from domesticated species, and lesser amounts imply
a mix of domesticated and wild species. We note that none of
our sediment samples contained more than 7e8% long cell
dendritic phytoliths.
In order to obtain a more precise identification of the origin
of the dendritic morphology of phytoliths present in the archaeological samples, we performed a morphometric test on
several archaeological samples following the method of Ball
et al. (1999). The results were compared to those obtained
from the modern plant reference collection. Fig. 5 shows
that brown sample 112 has dendritic morphologies similar to
those in Triticum aestivum. White sample 77 and gray sample
5171 also bear a strong resemblance to Triticum aestivum.
White sample 35 is similar to both Triticum aestivum and
Triticum dicoccum. None of the samples analyzed show similarities to Hordeum. The presence of Triticum aestivum is
consistent with identification of macrobotanical remains recovered from various sites in the region that span the Bronze
and Iron ages (Berlin et al., 2003; Borowski, 1987).
Another approach used to identify the type of grass present
in the samples and to determine if domesticated or wild
grasses are present, is the study of silicified multicellular

structures cells (Rosen, 1992). Our study shows differences in
maximum width and shape of waves between Hordeum and
Triticum (Fig. 6a and b). The morphometric analysis shows
that most of the long cells that form the multicellular structures in the archaeological samples resemble in maximum
width and shape of wave, phytoliths from Triticum aestivum
(Fig. 6c).
In conclusion, a good approximation of the proportion of
domesticated cereals can be obtained from the amounts of
long cell dendritic phytoliths, with 7e8% implying that all
the phytoliths were derived from cereals. Furthermore, most
of the phytoliths from cereals originate from Triticum.
3.4. Detailed analyses of the six phytolith-rich layers and
associated sediments
Fig. 7 shows the percentages of the most abundant phytolith
morphotypes present in each of the samples analysed from the
six locations. Note that duplicate or triplicate samples from the
phytolith-rich layers were analyzed and the standard deviations
are shown. We assume that similar error bars would be obtained

from the other samples. The following are detailed descriptions
of the six localities (see Fig. 1 for localities on the tell ).
3.4.1. Area G locality 1
3.4.1.1. Archaeological context. This is the thickest phytolithrich accumulation observed to date at Tel Dor (in places 30 cm
or more). It was produced at the beginning of phase G/11
(square AJ32N, locus 18497). The underlying phase, local
phase G/12, is the earliest exposed in area G, reached only
in two limited probes. It consists of a thick fill with no discernable surfaces and is not associated with any known architecture. The sherds in this fill date it to the Late Bronze Age II
(the 14th to 13th century BCE). Phase G/11 also has no architecture in the excavated area, save for one installationdthree
low stone walls (W18463, W18471, and W18528) framing an
area filled with bivalve shells of the genus Glycimeris. Other
than that, phase G/11 is evident only in a series of superimposed phytolith-rich gray and white layers, generally sloping
from northeast to southwest. These were found below the
shell-floor installation. Some of the sediments in this phase

are heated sediments in secondary deposition (Berna et al.,
2007). The pottery assemblage from phase G/11 mostly dates
to a late phase in the Late Bronze Age II (mid-late 13th century BCE). As no real architecture was found in phase 11, we
deduce that this was an open space.
3.4.1.2. Micromorphology. A 20 cm long block was extracted
at a location where the layer is ca. 12 cm thick. The brown
sediment below this layer is composed of quartz sand grains,
calcite, clay and artifacts (e.g., ceramics, bones). Its uppermost
part contains authigenic phosphate nodules. A densely laminated phytolith-rich layer lies just above the brown layer
(Fig. 2c). This layer includes quartz sand grains, calcite,
clay, charcoal, wood ash and bones, in addition to many phytoliths. In its lower part calcite seems to have dissolved and in
certain places calcitic components such as rock fragments
have phosphatic reaction rims. Dung spherulites are not abundant in the section. Certain spherical features ca. 20e50 mm in
diameter, are composed of phosphate, which may represent
phosphatized dung spherulites. The presence of dissolved calcite and phosphate nodules even below the phytolith-rich layer
indicates that degrading organic matter released phosphate and
acids that percolated into the sediments below.
3.4.1.3. Phytolith assemblages. The layer was divided into
three sub-layers differentiated mainly by color; sample 32 was
grayer than the samples immediately above and below (samples
31 and 3). The white-gray sample 32 has less phytoliths and less
dung spherulites. Note the abundance of dung spherulites in
samples 31 and 3 (Table 2). Morphologically, the three phytolith-rich layers are dominated by grass phytoliths with a high
proportion of inflorescence derived phytoliths (Fig. 7). The
proportion of dendritic epidermal long cell phytoliths is around
2e4%, implying that less than half the phytoliths were derived

from domesticated cereals. None of these sub-layers contain
burned phytoliths. We also noted that the lowest layer (3) contains many weathered phytoliths (Table 2).
3.4.2. Area G locality 2
3.4.2.1. Archaeological context. This phytolith-rich layer
(locus F04G-004; Fig. 8a) is located inside a built-up space
(room or inner courtyard) that is part of a much larger building
complexda courtyard building of the early Iron Age (Fig. 8b).
This structure was first built in local phase G/10 (Ir1ac. early
to mid 11th century BCE; for a discussion of the Early Iron
Age sequence at Dor and its radiocarbon dating see Gilboa
and Sharon (2003), Sharon et al. (2005) and Sharon and Gilboa (in press). It remained in use for a long time and was
structurally modified several times (local phases G/9, 8, 7, 6
span the Iron Age I and extend into Iron Age IIA (local terminology: Ir1a to Ir2a), until the 9th century BCE according to
the Dor radiocarbon chronology). At the end of phase G/9
the building suffered a major destruction (c. 1000 BCE; e.g.,
Sharon and Gilboa, in press; Berna et al., 2007) but was
quickly rebuilt along the same lines as before.
When sampled, F04G-004 was confined on two sides by
walls (W9211 to the north and W9140 to the east). Wall
W9140, built of boulders (Fig. 8a in background) overlies
another wall built of smaller stones (W9915, barely visible
in Fig. 8a). There is also a small but distinct offset between
them. These two construction phases were attributed to phases
G/9 and G/10 respectively.
The distinct burnt layer of the G/9 destruction (Berna et al.,
2007; Sharon and Gilboa, in press) was concentrated in the SE
part of the building and gradually decreased towards the north
and west. In the sampled room, there was no evidence of fire,
but mud-brick collapse of the superstructure was found against

the phase G/9 walls. It sealed the phytolith-rich layer and ceramic vessels in primary deposition, though not quite in articulation, in and above the phytoliths. Thus F04G-004 should
represent the floor level at the time of the phase 9 destruction.
Interestingly, however, the phytolith-rich layer does not abut
the bottom of the phase 9 wall, but abuts the underlying
wall from phase 10, a few centimeters below its top
(Fig. 8a). Thus technically it should be related to phase 10.
This in turn implies that an undisturbed phase 9 collapse has
no phase 9 living-surface below it. A possible solution to
this stratigraphic conundrum may be related to the taphonomy
of phytolith-rich layers (see below).
Sifting of the phytolith-rich layer sediment produced
dozens of tiny beadsdc. 1 mm thick or lessdmade of
gold, copper glass and frit. Below the phytolith-rich layer
was a rough flagstone pavement, whose relation to the walls
could not be established and below that were more phytolith-

rich layers. The fact that this space was stone-paved is unusual. Elsewhere in Iron Age buildings at Dor, including in
monumental constructions, floors were earthen. In the area
G building in question, the only other space that was continuously (partially) stone-paved is its central courtyard,
which throughout its existence served various industrial
activities.
3.4.2.2. Micromorphology. A series of thin (millimeters to
centimeters in thickness) white phytolith-rich layers are present, separated by layers of brown clay-rich sediment. The micromorphological section shows two layers both possessing
a microlaminated structure. The laminae are dense (ca. 10%
voids by area). The two layers contain only small amounts
of quartz sand grains (ca. 10% by area), clay and calcite, in
addition to the opaline phytoliths. Dung spherulites are notably absent in the section (see also Table 2). Authigenic

both Triticum aestivum and Triticum dicoccum.

phosphate nodules (composed of dahllite) are present, indicating that organic matter degraded at this location.
3.4.2.3. Phytolith assemblages. The white colored layers contain mainly grass phytoliths with a high proportion of inflorescence derived phytoliths. The phytolith morphotype analyses
of the thicker white layers all show that the dendritic epidermal long cell phytoliths constitute between 7 and 8% of all
the phytoliths. This is the same proportion present in modern
domesticated cereals. Furthermore morphometric analysis
shows that these phytoliths are similar to the modern wheat
species, Triticum aestivum. We therefore conclude that most
of these phytoliths were derived from domesticated cereals.
Spherulites and other microremains such as starch grains
were not identified in any of these samples (Table 2). Most

of the phytoliths have a refractive index lower than 1.440, indicating that these plants were not burnt (Elbaum et al., 2003)
(Table 2).
3.4.3. Area D5
3.4.3.1. Archaeological context. This excavated area (phase
D5/10) is a large (at least 5  10 m) apparently open space
in squares AV/8e10 (Fig. 9). At present it is unclear whether
it relates to any architecture. (In the immediate preceding and
subsequent phases in this area (respectively D5/11 and D5/9),
this space is bounded by walls. The three rubble walls in Fig. 9
belong to phase D5/9 and cut the sediments analyzed here).
Phase D5/10 dates to the Iron Age I/II transitional phase

radiocarbon sequence). The whole area consists of a series of
thick and thin phytolith-rich layers. At the macroscopic level,
the white phytolith layers are interspersed with dark brown
mud-brick material. The layers are extremely uneven. The entire series is as thick as 1 m in places. It generally slopes from
north to south in a series of distinct ‘steps’ as well as sloping
from west to east in a less dramatic fashion. Moreover, the
center of the area forms a trough-like depression, as wide as
1 m and 50 cm deep. One part slopes from north to south
and another to the east, to form a sunken ‘‘G’’ shaped feature
(Fig. 9). Abundant ceramics in all these layers comprised
small potsherds only, and bones, obviously in secondary deposition. Immediately below the series of phytolith-rich layers is
a heavily burnt destruction layer (phase D5/11) containing
many in situ pots dating to the Iron Age I.
3.4.3.2. Micromorphology. A 25 cm long block was extracted
that included alternating white-brown sediments and uniformly brown sediment above. Thirteen distinct phytolithrich layers over a total thickness of 20 cm were identified.
Their thicknesses vary between 1 and 10 mm. One of these
layers appears to be burnt based on the abundance of charcoal
and calcitic ash. The thickness of the brown sediment between
these layers varies between 5 and 15 mm. All layers are microlaminated, but with different phytolith densities, i.e., some

show compacted phytoliths stacked one on top of the other,
and others show an accumulation of white fiber-like microlayers alternating with brown material. The overall porosity
of these layers varies between 10 and 30% of void areas. Usually a 10% void area corresponds to high phytolith densities.
Other materials identified in some of the phytolith layers,
include dung spherulites, microscopic bones, burnt clay, charcoal and ash, in addition to the usual quartz sand grains, clay
and calcite (Table 2, Fig. 2d).
3.4.3.3. Phytolith assemblages. Phytoliths were well preserved and more abundant in the white and gray samples as
compared to the brown samples. The refractive index ratio is
always below 0.1 indicating that the phytoliths were not burnt.
The exception is the gray colored lens (sample 7), where the
phytoliths have a refractive index ratio of 5 (Table 2) and
are therefore burnt. Grasses represent more than 91% of the
total phytolith count, and the proportions of phytoliths from
the inflorescence parts are relatively high. The exception is
sample 17, which has an inflorescence content of 26%. The
proportion of dendritic epidermal long cell phytoliths is between 1 and 4%, implying that, at most, about half the phytoliths were derived from domesticated cereals. We also noted

70

R.M. Albert et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 57e75

the presence of a few short cells of bilobates, either from C4
grasses or in sample 17. The grasses are derived from both
wild and domesticated plants. Dung spherulites are present
in the white and gray powdery samples, but are more abundant
in brown sample 17.
3.4.4. Area D2
We analyzed three phytolith-rich layers from this area
(Fig. 10, localities 1, 2 and 3). All are ascribed to phase D2/6.
Phase D2/6 is composed of a series of occupation surfaces,
pits and depressions which cut the massive ashlar architecture
and crushed kurkar floors of phase 7 (Iron Age IIA, 9th century BCE). The general character of phase D2/6 indicates an
open area, dotted by refuse pits. It is quite long-lived, spanning
the Iron Age IIB (8th century BCE) and Iron Age IIC (7th century). During this time pits were filled in, often with alternate
layers of different materials, and new pits were dug, sometimes cutting earlier ones. The different ages of the sub-phases
are sometimes discernable stratigraphically and sometimes by
the relative typology of the ceramic assemblages within them.
3.4.5. D2 locality 1
3.4.5.1. Archaeological context. This phytolith-rich layer was
found over an area of some 4  4 m2 (square AO12, locus
L04D2-023) (Fig. 10, L 1), and in one place it was draped
over a group of fairly large fallen stones. There is no evidence
that this layer was part of a pit or dumping area. This phytolith-rich layer forms one of a series of more-or-less horizontal
surfaces which underlie phase D2/5 (Persian period) walls in
AO12 and seal the crushed kurkar surfaces that reach the ashlar walls of phase D2/7. Thus, by default, the phytolith-rich
layer should be considered a phase 6 feature, though there
is no stratigraphic link between it and the phase 6 pits in
AM14eAO14 (discussed below). The ceramic horizon indicated by their contents is unclear: somewhere in the 9th to
8th century BCE range. No architecture is associated with

phase D2/6 in this unit. The best assessment is that this was
an open area, littered with stones and other debris from the
collapse of previous structures.
3.4.5.2. Micromorphology. A 15 cm long block was examined
that includes brown sediment below the white layer. The latter
is overlain by gray sediment. The white phytolith-rich layer,
ca. 10 cm thick, has a massive and compact microstructure
(Fig. 2b). It has vertical voids (channels) through which water
drained downwards. Calcite hypocoatings are present around
the voids, and movement of quartz grains along the vertical
drainage channels is also evident. The drainage channels
caused fragmentation of the phytolith-rich layer. Intact domains of the phytolith-rich layer found between the drainage
channels have ca. 5% voids by area and ca. 10% quartz grains
by area. The layer also contains calcite and clay, small
amounts of charcoal and fragments of bones, shells, burned
kurkar and pottery. There are several small domains that
posses a microlaminated structure. Dung spherulites, as well
as phosphatized spherulites and phosphate nodules are present
in the section. These data indicate that the layer is derived
from dung and it resembles the layer described below for
D2 locality 2, square AO14.
3.4.5.3. Phytolith assemblages. The phytolith assemblages of
the two white samples are very similar, but the brown sample
from associated sediment is significantly different both in
number (Table 2) and morphology (Fig. 7). Only one of the
white samples however contained spherulites. The refractive
index ratio is below 0.1 in all three samples indicating that
the phytoliths were not burnt. The assemblage of phytoliths
is similar to that found in locality 2, square AO14 (see below)
although with a lesser proportion of dendritic long cell phytoliths, which is around 2%, implying that most of the phytoliths
were derived from wild grasses.
3.4.6. D2 locality 2
3.4.6.1. Archaeological context. This phytolith-rich layer
covers a relatively large area (square AO14, locus F04D2063) (Fig. 10, L 2), and follows the underlying surface topography. The latter was formed by two large pits dug prior to
the deposition of the phytolith-rich layer. Pit L05D2-544 is
the earlier of the two. After it was filled in, another pit
(L05D2-517) was dug, partly cutting into L05D2-544. Both
pits cut the large ashlar wall W04D2-065 of phase D2/7
and its associated crushed-kurkar floors. The phytolith-rich
layer studied in detail covered pit L05D2-544 more-or-less
horizontally, but then sloped sharply (at one spot almost
vertically) into pit L05D2-517 where it continued at a lower
elevation. There is no direct stratigraphic link between the
pit-complex in AN-AO14 and that of AM14, but the pottery
horizon of the entire AO14 complex (including the potsherds
found in the phytolith layer itself), is definitely early in phase
D2/6 (Iron Age IIB (8th century BCE) rather than Iron Age
IIC (7th century). The nature of the fill-layers is also different. The AO14 pits contain far less pottery than the AM14
7th century pit (below). It represents a ‘mundane’ household

R.M. Albert et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 57e75

assemblage, mostly not in primary deposition, and little or no
metallurgical wastes.
3.4.6.2. Micromorphology. Two blocks were collected. One
includes the white phytolith-rich layer and the associated
brown sediments, and the other a phytolith-rich powdery
gray sediment. This block overlies the white phytolith-rich
layer in certain places. The white layer possesses a massive,
un-oriented, microstructure. It is very compact (5% voids by
area) and includes quartz sand grains (10% by area), small
amounts of clay, calcite, microscopic bones (some are burnt),
and probable burnt mud-brick fragments. It also includes
authigenic phosphate nodules that extend to the brown layer
below. The gray powdery layer was sampled in the deepest
part of the feature. The gray layer possesses a microlaminated
structure that is usually not continuous over many centimeters,
probably because this layer is very porous (30% voids by area)
possibly promoting the collapse of the original microstructure.
The gray layer is composed almost entirely of phytoliths. It
also includes quartz sand grains (5% by area), clay, calcite,
and many charred vegetal remains. Certain rounded silicate
grains are amorphous and have a bubbly appearance, and
one quartz grain was identified as having an amorphous rim.
These properties indicate that the organic matter burnt at
a rather high temperature. Other burnt materials found in
this layer are calcite nodules, mud-brick and/or ceramic fragments. The layer includes authigenic phosphate nodules.
3.4.6.3. Phytolith assemblages. Two samples from the white
phytolith-rich layer were analyzed. The gray sample was located on top of the white layer. One brown sediment sample
was analyzed from immediately above the same white layer
(Table 2). Grasses dominate the phytolith assemblage in all
the samples. The proportion of dendritic epidermal long cell
phytoliths in both the white and the gray samples is between 3
and 4%, implying that about half the phytoliths were derived
from domesticated cereals (Fig. 7). The refractive index ratio
of the phytoliths is below 0.1 in all the white and brown sediments and above 1.7 in the gray samples. The phytoliths in
the latter are therefore burnt. The white layer contains a relatively high proportion of phytoliths from the inflorescence,
and a small number of spherulites (Table 2). The phytolith assemblage from the gray sediment differs from that of the white
sediment (Fig. 7), aside from being burnt, by having proportionately more leaf phytoliths than the white layer and many spherulites (Table 2). The brown sediment above the white layer
contains relatively high concentrations of phytoliths compared
to other clay-rich brown layers, and large amounts of
spherulites.
3.4.7. D2 locality 3
3.4.7.1. Archaeological context. This area was part of a very
large (about 100 m2) pit that was dug into a mud brick layer
(square AM14, loci L05D2-808 and L05D2-801) (Fig. 10, L
3). The abundant pottery dates it to the Iron Age IIC; mostly
the late 8th/first half of 7th century BCE. This corresponds

71

to the Assyrian occupation period of the Levant. Indeed, the
pottery is the most remarkable macroscopic aspect of this
pit. Some of the layers seem to be composed almost exclusively of large potsherds, many of which could be mended
to form complete or near complete vessels. Almost all of these
are of two specific types; short-necked straight-shouldered
transport jars typical of the 7th century BCE. These are abundant in Phoenician entrepôts across the Mediterranean; and
small, crudely formed jugs of an uncommon type, both at
Dor and elsewhere. The pit also contains abundant debris
from metallurgical industries and two distinct phytolith-rich
layers. Here we examined the lower phytolith-rich layer (locus
L05D2-808) which is overlain, in many places, by a gray powdery phytolith-rich sediment (locus L05D2-801), which is
clearly thicker in the depressed areas. The powdery gray layer
forms the base of a burnt assemblage of sedimentary minerals
that is over 30 cm thick. In addition to the pottery, many bones
were closely associated with the phytolith layers.
3.4.7.2. Micromorphology. The white phytolith-rich layer has
a dense microlaminated structure. The layer is ca. 3 cm thick
with about 10% of voids. The layer contains mainly phytoliths,
quartz sand grains (ca. 5%), calcite and clay, and in addition,
pottery sherds, shell fragments, kurkar fragments, burnt bones,
plaster, and a rounded grain of basalt. Small spherical phosphatized features may be phosphatized dung spherulites. Phosphate nodules are present. They are abundant at the upper
centimeter of the layer.
The gray layer immediately above the phytolith layer is ca.
8 cm thick and generally has a massive structure except for
areas where charred fibers are horizontally oriented (Fig. 2e).
It is relatively porous (ca. 20% voids by area). This layer has
more calcite than the layer below and also includes clay and
quartz sand grains (the latter comprise some 10% by area). Artifacts in this layer are fragments of pottery, burnt bones (some
of them calcined), possible glass, charcoal, burned kurkar fragments with unburnt cores, mud brick fragments, plaster fragments, chalk and one rounded clay curl. Towards the top of
this layer is a sub-layer ca. 1 cm thick of articulated microlaminated phytoliths derived from burned grass.
3.4.7.3. Phytolith assemblages. Two samples from the white
phytolith-rich layer were analyzed. The two gray samples
were located on top of the white layer and were separated
by a few centimeters. One brown sediment sample was analyzed from immediately below the white layer and another
from immediately above the same white layer (Table 2). Phytoliths are abundant in the white and gray colored samples.
The phytolith assemblages are similar in the two white phytolith-rich samples, but are different in the gray and brown
samples. The two gray samples have different assemblages,
even though they are separated by only a few centimeters
(Fig. 7). The refractive index ratio indicates that phytoliths
were not burnt in the white and brown samples but were burnt
in the gray samples. Spherulites are present in small amounts
in the white phytolith-rich samples, and are abundant in the
gray samples. They were also present in the brown samples

72

(Table 2). Grasses dominate the assemblages (above 89% of
the total counting). The proportions of inflorescences is highest in the white samples (54%), slightly lower in the gray samples (38e43%) and lowest in the brown samples (26e34%).
The long cells dendritic phytoliths of both the white and
gray layers constitute about 3e5% of the total assemblage.
The phytoliths in these layers were therefore derived from
a mix of both wild and domesticated grasses. The gray samples contain a small but significantly larger amount of leaf
phytoliths as compared to the white samples.
4. Discussion
The phytoliths from the phytolith-rich layers are almost all
derived from grasses, with a relatively high proportion from
the plant inflorescence. The gray layers all contain burnt phytoliths and a higher percentage of phytoliths from grass leaves,
whereas the white layers are not burnt and inflorescence phytoliths are, in general, more abundant. At this level the analyses of the 6 phytolith-rich layers present a rather uniform and
consistent picture. There are however significant differences.
These are summarized in Table 5.
Three out of the six phytolith-rich layers (area G loc. 1,
area D5 and area D2 loc. 3) have properties consistent with
having originally been formed from dung in animal enclosures. These are a microlaminated structure indicative of trampling by animals (Shahack-Gross et al., in press), phosphate
nodules indicative of the breakdown of organic materials,
dung spherulites produced in the digestive systems of certain
herbivores, especially abundant in area G loc. 1, and phytoliths
derived from a mix of both domesticated and wild grasses. We
know from ethnography that a mix of wild and domestic
grasses is widely used as animal fodder.
The two phytolith-rich layers in area D2 (localities 1 and 2)
differ from the others by having a massive rather than a laminated microstructure. Dung spherulites are either absent or
present in low numbers, especially when compared to the
gray sediments immediately above (area D2 locality 2). The
reason for the low number of dung spherulites could be explained by diagenetic processes (see below). The massive
structure is more consistent with animal dung having been redeposited in these locations. It is possible that the massive
structure may indicate localities of dung cake preparation or
other activities using dung as a construction material as wetting and churning of dung as a first step in molding dung
into specific (macro) structures is a process that probably results is random orientations of the plant fibers in the dung.
The phytolith-rich layer from area G locality 2 presents
properties that cannot be interpreted unequivocally. The microlaminated structure implies that this layer resulted from
trampling. It is within or on the side of a small paved room
floor, includes only cereal phytoliths and dung spherulites
are absent. Authigenic phosphate nodules are present, indicating that organic matter degraded at this location. If this was
a storage area for cultivated crops, then the presence of a microlaminated texture remains unaccounted for. There is no parsimonious explanation for the formation of this layer.

Concentrations of dung spherulites in modern samples are
very high (they range between 50 and 300 million per gram
of ashed dung) in relation to the concentrations found in the
archaeological sediments (Table 2). This may be due to diagenesis. Spherulites are susceptible to dissolution, especially
as the pH becomes acidic when large amounts of organic
matter degrades (Canti, 1999). This could even differentially
affect the spherulites as compared to the calcite which is present in many of these samples, usually in small amounts. This is
deduced from Shahack-Gross et al.’s (2003) observation that
the spherulites are initially formed from monohydrocalcite
and not calcite. The former is much more soluble than calcite.
We also noted phosphatic spheres in the range of sizes that is
similar to that of dung spherulites, thus indicating that phosphatization of dung spherulites may occur due to diagenesis
in an environment rich in phosphate. Dung spherulites are totally absent from the area G locality 2 phytolith-rich sample.
Dung spherulites are produced by many animal species (Canti,
1997) but are known to be present in large amounts in ruminants, i.e., cattle, sheep and goats. A zooarchaeological study
in Tel Dor showed that the majority of faunal remains were
from sheep and/or goats (Gerstel-Raban, in press). Thus spherulites should be present in dung accumulations.
Gray powdery phytolith-rich layers have phytolith assemblages that are burnt and they contain dung spherulites. Micromorphological analysis shows that the gray color is due to the
presence of charcoal. Their presence indicates that dung may
have been burnt as fuel and that its ash was dumped at the localities studied here. The presence of small domains of microlaminated structure is puzzling, as we do not expect it to
preserve if the dung ash is re-deposited. The other possibility
is that the dung was burnt in situ and that its structure collapsed into the many voids evident in these gray sediments
(see micromorphological descriptions above). However the
phytolith assemblages in the gray sediments differ from those
in the white layers at the same localities. This is consistent
with the gray sediment not being burnt in situ. Moreover,
the presence of microlaminated domains together with high
porosity in the gray sediments indicates that these sediments
were not trampled after deposition as this would probably destroy the lamination and reduce the porosity. It seems that the
white and gray layers reflect different uses of the same area,
albeit, at least in some areas, both involving animal dung.
Note however, that we observed one thin phytolith-rich gray
layer (Fig. 2d layer number 3) whose structure was microlaminated throughout, probably indicating that it was burnt in situ.
The absence of phytoliths from reeds or from palm trees
implies that none of the phytolith-rich layers we have sampled
to date are derived from matting. The mix of wild and domestic grasses is also inconsistent with the phytoliths being
derived from thatched roofing, which is usually built from
the stems of domesticated cereals.
4.1. Taphonomic implications
In the area G locality 2, all the phytolith-rich and associated
layers slope sharply upwards towards the walls (Fig. 8). This

could be due to subsidence of the floors. In fact if other phytolith-rich layers are present deeper in the section, this would
explain why the floors found directly under the phase G/9
mud-brick collapse seem to reach a phase G/10 wall. In area
D5, the phytolith-rich layers as well as the associated layers
have arc-like subsidence features which correlate with existing
robber-trenches. Thus the compression of the organic-rich sediments presumably followed the underlying topography defined
by the robber trenches. In area D2 locality 2 the phytolith-rich
layer also followed the pre-existing pit topography and at one
location was almost vertical. In locality 1 they were draped
over the surface of a series of large rocks, which must have
been under the organic-rich sediments. All these phenomena
can be explained by the taphonomic degradation of a thick
organic-rich layer that leaves a relatively thin residue on the substrate. Such large volume reductions of organic-rich sediments
can result in artefacts changing their stratigraphic positions
relative to the architecture. They can also cause concentrations
of artefacts that were originally separated.
4.2. Cultural implications
Phytolith-rich layers were found at Dor in open spaces between houses, courtyards within houses, roofed spaces within

houses, refuse pits, and even in monumental public structures.
Their presence on the tell indicates an intimate association between humans, animals, plants and bio-waste products, such
as chaff, straw, unconsumed animal fodder, and animal dung
during the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age. Thus open lots
and/or unoccupied structures within the town were used as
animal enclosures or for the disposal of organic-rich waste
products. This may well have implications for estimating population size from the site area, herd size for individual enclosures or even the very assumption of a ‘‘stratum’’, namely that
all structures within the stratum were in use at the same time.
A broader question arises from the association between
humans, animals and plants in an urban context. It is noteworthy
that all of the ethnographic parallels referred to in the introduction
are from agro-pastoralist villages. In towns in the present-day
Near East, even traditional ones, animal and vegetal materials
are mainly introduced as more-or-less processed consumer
goods. Thus the patterns of co-habitation of humans with animals,
their food and their dung are significantly different than that observable in villages. Dor however was an urban center throughout
the period under study. Indeed, in one of the sub-periods, the Iron
Age I, a ‘dark age’ around the entire Mediterranean, Dor is one of
the few flourishing urban centers, boasting massive fortifications
and monumental public structures.

74

R.M. Albert et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 57e75

Chronologically the phytolith-rich layers range from the
Late Bronze Age (13th/12th century BCE) to the end of the
Iron Age (7th century BCE). Although we have not systematically surveyed all exposures on the tell, phytolith-rich layers
are almost totally absent in the later Persian, Hellenistic and
Roman strata. This in turn might indicate a major change in the
urban environment following the Iron Age, and perhaps the
very definition of a city (urbis) itself. Some time between
the end of the Iron Age and the onset of the Hellenistic period,
a dichotomy was created between ‘village’, where agricultural
goods are produced and humans cohabitate with animals,
plants, and their waste products, and ‘city’ as the realm of
a consumer society. There are clues that this indeed may be
the case. For instance, it has often been noted that biblical Hebrew has no word to denote ‘village’. Any habitation larger
than an isolated farm is a ‘town’. Mishnaic Hebrew (i.e.,
during the Roman period) already possesses a separate word
for ‘village’.
Archaeologists are used to thinking in terms of a single
‘urban revolution’, which happened in the case of the Levant
at the beginning of the third millennium BCE. It consisted
of the nucleation of settlements in which supra-subsistence
activities (trade, storage and re-distribution, craftsmanship,
ritual, government, etc.) are centered. Our evidence suggests
that in Dor at least, households remained a locus of primary
food production, with the attendant biogenic wastes. This is
also indicated by a recent analysis of the early Iron Age faunal
assemblage of area D2 (Gerstel-Raban, in press), in which
parameters like the distribution of (mostly domesticated) animals, age and gender distribution, body-part representation,
butchering, filleting and skinning marks, and more, indicate
that meat was not only consumed at Dor, but also produced
there. If the observations at Dor are representative for these
periods, then the second ‘urban revolution’ which pushed primary food production and its wastes out of the town altogether
or at least proscribed it to specific spaces (markets, public stables, etc.), might have coincided with the Hellenization of the
Levant. (See for example Morris (1991, p. 40) and Whitley
(2001, p. 174) for a similar and largely contemporaneous process in Greece, i.e., ‘real’ urban space taking shape not before
the late 6th century BCE.) It is clear that the elucidation of the
physical and social matrix which we customarily designate as
an early Levantine town or city will have to reach beyond
architectural analyses (Herzog, 1997).
5. Conclusions
This study shows that layers composed mainly of phytoliths
can form. At Tel Dor they are for the most part the product of
the break down of animal dung. This dung accumulated either
in animal enclosures, or was redeposited under circumstances
that are not well understood. The transformation of the dung
accumulation into a relatively thin layer of phytoliths is
accompanied by significant reduction in volume and hence
can cause subsidence of the overlying strata. This may complicate stratigraphic relations in the field. Finally the identification of many such dung accumulations and hence animal

enclosures on the tell, raises questions about the style of life
of the tell inhabitants during these periods and the nature of
urbanism at this time.
