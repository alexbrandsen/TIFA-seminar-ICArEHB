Issues of early fire use have become topical in human evolution, after a long
period in which fire scarcely featured in general texts. Interest has been stimulated
by new archaeological finds in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and also by
major inputs from other disciplines, including primatology and evolutionary
psychology. Evidence for fire is, however, often disputed, especially with regard to
the early cases in Africa. Interpretations often struggle to take into account the
implications of a huge bias in archaeological preservation, which means that our
surviving evidence does not accurately map the past. Additionally, there is often a
‘yes-no’ presence/absence approach to fire, which does not recognise that earliest
hominin fire use may have occurred in interaction with natural fire, and may not
even have included deliberate hearth use in its first stages. Here we examine the
need to integrate different approaches to the issues of early fire-use, considering
especially the earliest archaeological evidence and the ‘cooking hypothesis’, while
also tackling the issues of apparent differences in early African and European fire
records.

J.A.J. Gowlett and R.W. Wrangham

The question of early fire use has recently become topical after a long period in
which fire scarcely featured in general anthropological and archaeological texts and
contributions were rare. Interest has been stimulated by a series of new archaeological finds, but also by major inputs from other disciplines, including primatology
and evolutionary psychology. However, the study of fire in human evolution is not a
mature science. It remains controversial, with a wide range of views about the dates
of first control and about the driving forces governing fire use. We review these here,
looking particularly at the African picture, but also considering apparent discrepancies with the European record which have come to the fore recently. This paper
represents an effort by an archaeologist/palaeoanthropologist and a primatologist/
biologist to reconcile two of the viewpoints in a more integrated approach. We set
out to make a new evaluation of the African record, just as Roebroeks and Villa
(2011) have made a new survey of the European evidence. Dates for the earliest
occupation of northern latitudes (up to 408N at Dmanisi in Georgia), have doubled
in recent years to almost two million years (Gabunia et al. 2000). Roebroeks and
Villa indicate that the majority of scholars regard the use of fire as a necessity for
such occupation, while disagreeing with this view themselves on the basis of their
analysis. Their analysis works from direct archaeological fire evidence rather than
from general considerations about early human adaptation: in a frequency study
they found that in Europe sites with fire evidence begin in small numbers in Marine
Isotope Stages 911 (up to 400,000 years ago) increasing steadily in later
interglacials. The authors took this pattern as militating against earlier fire use in
Europe.
Our paper has a very different standpoint but a commonality in recognising the
difficulties of all existing positions. It thus works towards a more mature patternbased approach to early fire studies (cf. also Alperson-Afil and Goren-Inbar 2010)
rather than engaging in an exercise of claim versus counter-claim.
Fire studies have been tentative largely because they have depended so much on
rare chance finds, but also because the ideas expressed have often lagged in taking
into account findings in other disciplines. In this account we highlight two factors
that frequently influence judgements. First, come the implications of a huge bias in
archaeological preservation, meaning that our surviving evidence simply does not
accurately map the past. Second, is the prevalent yes/no presence/absence approach
to fire, which concentrates on hearths, rather than dealing with the likelihood that
the earliest use of fire by hominins occurred in interaction with natural fire and may
not even have included deliberate or systematic hearth use in its first stages (Burton
2009).
Even allowing for these factors, however, the distribution of early fire evidence
presents major puzzles that may call for new hypotheses in interpretation. In this
paper we seek to address these issues formally, observing that the past cannot be
investigated by a single record, but that science must seek to reconcile and combine
several lines of evidence. These include not just archaeological evidence, but evidence
derived from a comparative view, illustrating complex changes in human makeup
and behaviour that necessarily happened somewhere along the evolutionary
trajectory (i.e. characters that were certainly absent in an ape ancestor, but that
are unquestionably present in modern humans). Both primatological and genetic
studies cast additional light on these developments (e.g. Green et al. 2010; Pruetz and
LaDuke 2010).

To take models for fire use beyond the simple ‘present or absent?’ questions, we
argue that fire must be set into more general resource and cognition models that
adequately reflect the complexity both of advanced mammals and of the natural
environment. Following the spirit of observations by Bickerton (2003: 78) on the
origins of language, it should ‘given goodwill and a little effort’ be possible to take on
board the key elements of several relevant disciplines and to accept that a working
hypothesis has to maintain validity in all of them * it cannot fail in one.
It can be asked whether it is necessary to struggle now with records that are so
dissonant. Why not simply leave each discipline on its own? Apart from the general
necessity of interdisciplinary work in human evolution, we would argue that it is
often the non sequiturs of the record that provide the loose ends for progress.
Reflecting on the philosophy of research, Arber (1985: 59) saw the explanation of a
phenomenon as ‘the discovery of its own intrinsic place in a nexus of relations,
extending indefinitely in all directions.’ The idea of seeing something simultaneously
‘in its full individuality’ and as ‘one element in a larger whole’ harmonises well with
recent archaeological approaches (e.g. Gamble and Porr 2005).
Hypotheses about early fire use
We aim here to outline the major hypotheses and then to discuss evidence. These
come from at least the following main areas:
Archaeological approaches
Archaeological hypotheses have been shaped since the 1950s, when K.P. Oakley took
a particular interest in the problem (Oakley 1956, 1961; Perlès 1975, 1977; James
1989). Since Oakley’s time they have been essentially minimalist, that is, with some
exceptions of broader treatment, each piece of fire evidence has been approached
outside a general framework, somewhat as a curiosity. A general acceptance that fire
use would have been important is combined with a view that it would represent a
significant cognitive leap, perhaps more than required for the development of stone
technologies. Rolland (2000: 212) expresses a common view in stating that ‘a date as
early as 1.6 m BP for fire-harnessing would require re-evaluating radically early
hominid behavioural capabilities.’ For some authors there has also been a perceived
gap between the human and the animal worlds, with Rolland (2002), for example,
citing an absence of animal analogues, in contrast with the position for hard
technologies. This gap is reduced, however, inter alia by bird fire-following (Berthold
et al. 2001) and signs of chimpanzee fire-awareness (Pruetz and LaDuke 2010).
In this environment, claims for fire use on archaeological sites have tended to
falter against the interpretation, ‘how do we know it isn’t wildfire?’ This crucial
question needs, of course, to be addressed and given a balanced methodological
context, by information about both wildfires and humanly controlled fires. In other
words, to assert ‘it is wildfire’ is a claim requiring as much scientific knowledge and
research involvement as the assertion ‘it is humanly controlled fire’. Neither is an
easy option, considering that (for example) on later Palaeolithic sites hearths vastly
outnumber documented cases of wildfire passing across sites.
To date, however, archaeology’s null hypothesis tends to be that fire-control
demands advanced cognition not proven to be essential to early hunter-gatherer

8

subsistence, and hence the former will not be accepted as a working hypothesis unless
it can be demonstrated beyond all reasonable doubt. This current framework is
admirably well suited for ruling out ‘false positives’, but in immediate terms it
inevitably promotes an inaccurate picture. Support for this point can be seen in the
general changes of Palaeolithic chronology through the last thirty years, in which the
dates for many phenomena of technology or of settlement have at least doubled.
Increasing the sampling has greatly extended the dates in many respects (e.g. for
beads, in which the oldest dates have risen from c. 40 ka to c. 120 ka (d’Errico et al.
2005; Vanhaeren et al. 2006), or in the controlled heating of stone, which has gone
back from the Upper Palaeolithic to c. 160 ka (Brown et al. 2009)). If archaeology
worked on its own, this unfolding process would be of little importance, because we
would merely be dealing with a somewhat concertinaed version of the reality in time.
But independent dated perspectives are now available from the fossil record, genetics
and evolutionary psychology, meaning that for an integrated science of human
evolution the calibrations have come to matter far more. If these records give
different answers (as we see below), then it becomes a matter of particular interest for
scientific enquiry.
Most archaeologists would agree that a primary role of archaeology is to provide
evidence that is reliable for interpretation, so that preferably we would make
statements only if the material record demonstrates them with certainty. If so, it is
fair to consider what constitutes an acceptable level of proof. In fire research there is
no one generally accepted protocol for investigation, but archaeologists and
archaeological scientists have worked to establish areas of expertise (e.g. Perlès
1975, 1977; Barbetti 1986; Bellomo 1993, 1994) that provide reliable answers.
Bellomo (1993, 1994) set out to establish a general methodology for discriminating
modes of fire. His work emphasised the main forms of fire * hearth fire, grass fire
and stump fire * so as to provide a rulebook and his research is disposed to
conclude that temperature of burning will be a good discriminator between the
different modes of fire. Thus, his experiments showed that grass fires lead to transient
high temperatures and tend not to bake through sediments and bones, while natural
stump fires are held to be rare, because ignition was not easily obtained in the
experiments. This leaves hearths recognisable as often bowl-shaped features, with
sediments baked through at temperatures of usually c. 3008008C. A preoccupation
with discrimination through temperature is echoed in other work. It is certainly the
case that controlled camp fires normally burn in the temperature range 3008008C,
but an idea sometimes expressed that grass fires and other wild fires do not overlap
with this range is erroneous. Many grass fires move rapidly, achieving high
temperatures only for a few minutes, so that sediments, artefacts or bones would
not bake (Clements 2010, for example, records an experimental grass fire with high
heat lasting some three minutes, combustion zone gases at c. 7508C, and a plume
temperature of up to 2958C). It is easy, however, for such fires to catch hold of more
substantial vegetation, especially bushes with dry bushy stems (Gowlett, personal
observation, at Florisbad, South Africa, 2008, and Kilombe, Kenya, 2011). Bellomo
was, as we have already mentioned, inclined to dismiss the possibilities of stump fires,
as these are not easily ignited in experiments. There is, however, ample evidence of
them in forest fires, including falling tree boles, while in other examples a lightning
strike caused a tree to burn back into its roots (Tutin et al. 1996). (At Kilombe an
example of a stump burn in a bushfire is currently under study). In all these cases

natural fire temperatures will be at least as high as those of campfires and
discrimination by temperature appears very difficult.
These studies show that it is not easy to discriminate between all sources of fire
because they can actually have near-identical forms. Fire is able to mimic * but not
in quite symmetrical form. A human fire breaking free will resemble a wildfire, but a
wildfire ‘burning small’ will not exactly mimic hearths. In certain circumstances,
human fire use can be very certainly documented, even in the Lower Palaeolithic.
Such instances occur especially where burning is highly localised and are ideally
closely linked with artefacts. They include Schöningen in Germany, Beeches Pit in the
United Kingdom and Kalambo Falls in Zambia. At Schöningen several hearths
around one metre across are recognised, but most important a wooden stave * a
digging or throwing stick * was found by one of them, with just one end burnt
(Thieme 2005; see Lang et al. 2012 for an evaluation of the Schöningen dates, which
appear to be around 300 ka). At Beeches Pit, dated to c. 400 ka, there are similar
hearths; in this case an individual sat by one of them knapping a biface through a
series of nearly thirty strikes. Just three flakes in the series moved forwards into the
visible hearth area and only they are burnt red (Gowlett et al. 2005; Preece et al.
2006). African evidence from the same period is as strong, with a probable hearth
recognised at Kalambo Falls, as well as individual burnt wooden artefacts (Clark
2001; see below).
In other cases where the direct artefact connection is less strong, such as at Terra
Amata near Nice, France, (de Lumley 2009) and Gesher Benot Ya’aqov in Israel
(Goren-Inbar et al. 2004; Alperson-Afil 2008; Alperson-Afil and Goren-Inbar 2010)
the case is built up by very detailed work across a range of approaches, rather than by
one generally agreed methodology. Alperson-Afil and Goren-Inbar (2010, Figure
1.1) list the numbers of lines of evidence available for different sites, noting burnt
stones, burnt bones, burnt wood, burnt sediments, burnt shells and charcoal as
separate categories. Microstratigraphic approaches can also often provide detailed
information about their contexts (e.g. Berna et al. 2012).
Overall, where fire evidence is strong, but where highly specific evidence for
human involvement is lacking, it seems difficult to resolve doubts once they have
been expressed in the literature. Zhoukoudian in northern China offers an example
of a site where argument has raged back and forth. Here, human fire control was for
long broadly accepted (Black 1934; Oakley 1956, 1964), then contested (Binford and
Ho 1985; Binford and Stone 1986), then re-evaluated (Weiner et al. 1998; Goldberg
et al. 2001) and evaluated further (Boaz et al. 2004). In this research much of the
‘burnt’ material was shown not to be burnt, but to result from mineral staining, and
it was also shown that there was no evidence for formal hearths. Nevertheless, burnt
bone occurs in this early site (Weiner et al. 1998) and it remains very likely that this
results from human fire use rather than reflecting a pattern of natural burning.
Reservations appear in many discussions of the site, partly on the grounds that
studies of bone taphonomy there have shown a high carnivore involvement. The
locality was a part-open cave used as a hyena den and the argument follows that
bones of prey would have been burnt by natural fires of grass or other vegetation that
swept through the site. Accounts such as Binford’s emphasising the faunal
taphonomy do not, however, evaluate the point that more than 100,000 artefacts
have been found through the various levels, marking a repeated and significant
human presence. Carnivore activity cannot be taken to minimise the abundant

10 J.A.J. Gowlett and R.W. Wrangham
evidence for human activity and the complexities of human and animal use can even
be seasonal. The case of Zhoukoudian echoes Bickerton’s (2003) point that an
interpretation must take into account all the main arguments and cannot fail in one.
In summary, archaeology as a discipline still has difficulties with the conundrum
of ‘absence of evidence is not evidence of absence’. Any time this mantra appears it is
a sign of frustration with the record, but it is also a challenge to engage with that
record through alternative approaches and modelling, rather than simply accepting
defeat.
Preservation and sampling remain absolutely central issues. We know for certain
from patterns in recent evidence that most of the evidence of fire disappears most of
the time. If we automatically accept the apparent picture as representing the reality,
sampling factors alone would ensure that the early record largely disappears from
serious consideration. Inevitably archaeology will be likely to have a mismatch with
evidence from other disciplines. In particular, it will offer a contracted view, with
sophisticated behaviours systematically taken as appearing later than they actually
did. We must ask whether archaeology can address such problems (Gamble et al.
2011). It could perhaps seek something closer to the symmetry approach employed
by David Clarke (1968) in his discussion of Occam’s razor and the inverse Occam’s
razor. Occam’s razor urges adoption of the most parsimonious explanations without
any unnecessary complexity; the inverse razor as discussed by Clarke cautions
against the adoption of explanations that are simpler than we know to be the case.
Although fire studies are sometimes controversial, there are clearly cases where
archaeology can resolve matters and a few basic points that might gain broad
support:






natural fire certainly comes first, occurring in areas frequented by humans
(otherwise they would not have had their primary access to fire) with the effect
that human fire will overlap with natural fire;
hearths are the most valuable archaeological indicator of fire-use, but may be a
small part of a general picture in which fire was also exploited on landscapes;
in discriminating natural and human-controlled fire, traditional measures such
as temperature are not always helpful, while localised and repeated burning
are useful indicators and part-burnt single artefacts or artefact sets are the
most powerful deciding evidence, with the very selective heating of humanly
made material ruling out larger bushfires.

Dietary hypotheses
Dietary hypotheses relating to fire have been proposed a number of times (Brace
1995; Wrangham et al. 1999; Wrangham 2009, 2011) and reflect the major change of
ecology that is strikingly obvious when comparing human and ape adaptations,
especially those of the chimpanzee, our nearest living relative. Apes are essentially
fruit- and foliage-eating animals of the rain forests. Chimpanzees have a broaderbased diet than gorillas, extending to honey, insects, and meat, but fruits remain their
preferred and dominant staple, with other soft vegetation used as fallback. In
tropical rainforests ripe fruits are available at most times. Apes living in bush or
savanna environments with lower rainfall and a more marked regime of wet and dry

Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa 11
seasons would not be able to obtain an equivalent diet. In particular, fruit would be
seasonal, creating feeding pressures in dry seasons. The addition of carbohydrates in
the form of tubers, corms, bulbs, rhizomes and other plant storage organs would
have significantly eased this problem for australopithecines (Laden and Wrangham
2005).
Just like any other animal, humans have traditionally been thought to be capable
of thriving on a raw food diet. Based on that assumption the dietary specialisation
associated with hominisation would have consisted merely of a change in composition, for example adding more meat (Milton 1999), extending variety (Ungar et al.
2006) or emphasising tubers (O’Connell et al. 1999). However even when eating
domesticated foods, women eating an all-raw diet tend to suffer chronic energy
shortage and amenorrhea (Koebnick et al. 1999). Animals also tend to show superior
growth or weight gain on diets of cooked foods, thanks to an increase in digestibility
and a reduction in the costs of digestion (Carmody and Wrangham 2009; Carmody
et al. 2011). Since wild foods have numerous energetic deficiencies compared to
domesticated foods, including fewer sugars, less starch and more fibre, this suggests
that raw wild foods would be an inadequate basis for population survival. Indeed, no
cases have been reported of societies relying on raw food for most of their diet, nor
are any individuals known to have survived for more than a few weeks on wild raw
food. Accordingly, humans appear to be different from every other animal in needing
their food to be of such high quality that in practice a large proportion of it must be
cooked (Wrangham and Conklin-Brittain 2003). The only alternative is that
prehistoric humans found highly digestible foods that could be eaten without
thermal processing. While uncooked items such as honey, fruits, marrow and liver
could well be adequate at times, there is no model for such foods being sufficiently
available year-round to sustain a hunter-gatherer group.
The most obvious aspect of human biology associated with the requirement for a
cooked diet is a reduced digestive system compared to great apes, including small
molars, mouth, stomach and large intestine. The benefits of gut minimisation include
less energy having to be spent in metabolic activity. Since these benefits could not
have been realised until high-quality foods were available all year, tooth and gut
reduction appear to be unambiguous markers of adaptation to cooking. Furthermore, the calorific benefits of cooked food are so large, the food-softening effect of
cooking so strong, and the typical hunter-gatherer diet so difficult to ingest and
digest in its raw forms that the adoption of cooking is expected to have a greater
influence on tooth and gut reduction than any other dietary factors (Wrangham
2009).
The timing of the major reduction of the digestive system is therefore a
provocative issue. Since both teeth and guts show their most striking reduction
with the origin of Homo erectus, the cooking hypothesis argues that Homo erectus
must have controlled fire (Organ et al. 2011). In support of this, the post-cranial
anatomy of Homo erectus, including long legs and modern shape of trunk and
shoulders, suggests that this species climbed poorly. It was therefore unlikely to have
been able to spend its nights in tree refuges. Homo erectus therefore surely slept on
the ground. A shift to ground-sleeping is hard to explain without the protective
effects of the control of fire (Wrangham 2009; Wrangham and Carmody 2010). For
chimpanzees the presence of leopards ensures the use of tree nests and in ancient
savanna environments the predators were both varied and formidable. Similar factors

12 J.A.J. Gowlett and R.W. Wrangham
would seem to apply to varieties of Homo erectus beyond Africa. Although early
Homo from Dmanisi in Georgia retains primitive features at 1.8 Ma, and is relatively
small bodied, it had already acquired adaptations for striding locomotion and its
toothwear patterns suggest a broadening of diet (Pontzer et al. 2010, 2011). By this
time, it can now be seen, the distribution of early Homo was so wide that it is certain
that it must have mastered many environments (Clark 1993: 160) and sleeping in
trees could not always have been an option.
Social hypotheses
At present archaeology’s longstanding awareness of social factors is coming into
contact with other social hypotheses, in part derived from primate studies. They
include concepts of Machiavellian intelligence, especially the idea of the Social Brain
(Byrne and Whiten 1988; Dunbar 1998; Dunbar et al. 2010). The cooking hypothesis
is primarily ecological and physiological, but it can be linked with social factors.
Central in all hypotheses * the cause for the search for an evolutionary ‘driver’ *
is the fact that the greatly enlarged modern human brain is energetically very
expensive (Herculano-Houzel 2012): some process of selection must have made it pay
off. Even the initial enlargement from c. 400 cm3 in Australopithecines to c. 650 cm3
in early Homo represents a major change in costs. The social brain hypothesis seeks
to explain the huge increase in hominin brain size through the Pleistocene, seen at
different stages in several species. At each stage a larger brain has to work in terms of
physiology, that is, its pressing energy needs must be supported and provide sufficient
return in fitness for their extra costs. The social brain hypothesis * itself depending
on ecological circumstances * postulates that there will be a selection pressure for
optimum group size, and that * where group sizes rise in consequence * this
pressure will push towards improved social cognition. Larger brains are thus largely
about the management of relations in a complex social environment (Dunbar 1998;
Dunbar and Shultz 2007) and language also appears to have evolved as part of this
constellation of factors (Aiello and Dunbar 1993; cf. Ronen 1998).
The social brain hypothesis meshes easily with another idea, the expensive tissue
hypothesis (Aiello and Wheeler 1995). This argues that in terms of metabolism the
body cannot sustain a larger (more expensive) brain except by reducing other crucial
tissues. Aiello and Wheeler suggest that this is the gut and that a reduction of gut size
and energy costs could be achieved through the consumption of higher quality foods.
Hence the idea that fire, as a major step in pre-digestion, would greatly ease the
metabolic constraints on brain size (cf. Wrangham 2009). A closely related argument
is that raw foods are so much less rewarding than cooked foods that they demand too
much ingestion time for hominins with a human-sized brain to be able to satisfy their
energy demands (Fonseca-Azevedo and Herculano-Houzel 2012).
In assessing these hypotheses a particular question is whether they point to
changes at the same stage in the timescale. In effect, are they datable? The primary
evidence here is more likely to be the hominin fossils, rather than the archaeology,
since the former are reasonably well dated and can provide specific evidence about
brain size, teeth and skeletal proportions, as well as a certain amount of isotopic
evidence. The actual increase in brain size, and the costs of the brains, are the most
incontrovertible parts of this survey. The gradient of change is also reasonably well
dated as having been particularly strong in the period 2.31.7 Ma (Schoenemann

Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa 13
2006). The relationships between hypotheses are less straightforward. The cooking
hypothesis primarily provides a mechanism for delivering increased energy to larger
brains. The expensive tissue hypothesis primarily explains how the larger brain might
be resourced within a similar overall metabolism. The social brain hypothesis
provides a set of reasons for having a larger brain: improved social cognition
resulting from activity in larger group sizes required by ecological pressures. Other
hypotheses can be interpreted as related. Thus, O’Connell et al. (1999) emphasise
increasing diet breadth and the possible care provided by a grandparent generation,
while Allen et al. (2005) argue that increased brain size correlates with long lifespan,
and again may be related to the selective advantages conferred by grandparenting. As
they admit the correlation with language, or at least increased sociality, these ideas
actually interlink with those of the social brain. In summary, a large brain correlates
with complexity, is expensive and requires a higher quality of food. Smaller teeth and
much reduced chewing muscles are proof of the delivery of this; larger brains may be
seen in some sense as both benefiting from, and allowing the release from, large
teeth.
Do these hypotheses provide an alternative to archaeology? Some might argue
that their general power could make the detail of archaeology redundant, but these
hypotheses are not easy to disentangle and in scientific hypothesis testing nothing
can replace actual data. Moreover, fire-use is also a sociocultural phenomenon and
past cultural aspects can be investigated directly only from the archaeological record.

Evidence of early fire
The archaeological record
At present Africa provides the earliest sites that preserve traces of burning in one
form or other (Figure 1).
The earliest fire evidence with human associations so far comes from the area of
Lake Turkana in northern Kenya. At East Turkana some Oldowan localities date to
1.8 Ma, but they are far outnumbered by those of the somewhat later Karari
complex (1.6 Ma). Sites on the Karari ridge embrace a range of contexts, both
channel and floodplain, and show extensive hominid activities across the landscape
(Harris and Isaac 1997). The great majority of artefacts are made from lava cobbles,
collected from the beds of streams that ran ephemerally then, as now, in the area. The
site complex FxJj20 provides the key evidence for fire. It was excavated over large
areas, with four main assemblages totalling around 4000 artefacts. All are found in
fine-grained mud-silt horizons, but the shape of the distributions suggests some
reworking by water. In FxJj20E, in the base of the horizon, four reddened patches
were found, which are taken to suggest fire use, especially as thermally altered stones
were also found (Harris and Isaac 1997: 165; Bellomo 1993, 1994). Similar areas were
also found in FxJj20M (Bellomo and Kean 1997).
Bellomo and Kean (1997) present an analysis of the FxJj20 evidence, following
Bellomo’s methodology. The oxidised patches are about the ‘right’ size for hearths
and are fully oxidised to a depth of at least several centimetres. Magnetic
susceptibility tests show readings 150170% higher than those for adjacent
sediments. Bellomo and Kean were convinced that at least the FxJj20E occurrences
show unequivocal evidence for early human control of fire. In favour of this idea is

the pattern of occurrences, which occur repeatedly within the artefact scatters, and
do not occur in similar form elsewhere. Furthermore, Rowlett (1999, 2000) suggested
that the presence of varied phytoliths in the Koobi Fora patches is consistent with the
presence of controlled fire, rather than the natural burning of a trunk of a single
species. Following this research carried out within excavation areas, Ludwig (2000)
adopted a landscape approach around Lake Turkana, seeking to screen for burning
in artefacts. He found that burnt artefacts occurred on land surfaces back to c. 1.5
Ma but not beyond and suggested a threshold in early human fire control at this
stage.
Further early evidence of burning comes from Chesowanja in central Kenya and
may be as old. The Chesowanja sediments lie on the eastern side of Lake Baringo
(Carney et al. 1971; Bishop et al. 1975, 1978; Gowlett et al. 1981; Harris et al. 1983).
In the mapped sequence both the older Chemoigut and younger Chesowanja

Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa 15
Formations have similar gentle dips to the west, suggesting deposition within the
local same basin. The basalt member at the base of the Chesowanja Formation has
been dated to 1.4290.07 Ma, an age that fits well with all other observed evidence,
including the presence of Deinotherium bozasi and Australopithecus boisei in
sediments underlying the basalt (Bishop et al. 1978).
The Oldowan occurs at a number of levels in the Chemoigut Formation. The
evidence for burning comes from the largest excavated occurrence, GnJi 1/6E, which
uncovered around 700 artefacts, faunal remains and concentrations of baked clay, all
in close physical association (e.g. Figure 2). These finds have been interpreted as
probable evidence of controlled fire (Gowlett et al. 1981), although alternative
scenarios cannot be entirely ruled out (Gowlett et al. 1981; Clark and Harris 1985).
Isaac (1982) presented a critique, noting that burnt clasts are common elsewhere, for
example at Olorgesailie in southern Kenya (Isaac 1977), and that the clasts found at
Chesowanja may have been redistributed along a small channel. In a taphonomic
reassessment Gowlett (1999) used new data to present a three-dimensional analysis
of the distribution of burned clay clasts. This shows that the large clasts are
concentrated in a very small area less than one metre across (the ‘Q zone’) and
indicates that small clasts and flecks generally less than 20 g in weight washed or
rolled out from this area as sediments in the adjacent hollow accumulated through
some 50 cm. Stone refits were also found within the excavation area, including two
parts of a flake, and two flakes that conjoined with a cobble. This detailed
taphonomic analysis demonstrates the limited disturbance to the remains during

Figure 2. A north-south time transect showing some of the most informative fire sites from
Europe to Africa. The background shows the approximate time-space extent of known
archaeological sites (stone technology).

16 J.A.J. Gowlett and R.W. Wrangham
site formation (pace Isaac 1982). The ‘Q zone’ concentration thus remains as a
possible hearth feature.
Even so, the baked clasts at Chesowanja do not themselves add up to a preserved
hearth, though a possible ‘phantom hearth’ could be constituted by the stone
arrangement, the baked clay and the distributions of the artefacts and bones. Baking
of clasts is common when clay adheres to tree roots used as fuel. The distribution of
bones is inverse in density to the artefact concentration as might be expected if bones
at the centre had been destroyed by fire. One explanation, which remains to be ruled
out, is that a lightning strike on a dead tree surrounded by a termite nest caused
burning back into the roots. The subsequent break up of the earthen mound might
then have released baked clasts to roll into the archaeological area. The limited
quantity of clay (1 kg) and the tight distribution of the major baked clasts argue
against this interpretation, but more work is needed to determine if this possibility
can be eliminated.
In addition to these examples there is the case of Gadeb in Ethiopia (Barbetti
et al. 1980, 1986). Here, a group of stones of lava was thought to be burnt because of
discolouration (such as typically appears in the present if lava rocks are used as
hearthstones). Barbetti and colleagues concluded that the stones had probably been
burnt, but could not be entirely certain because the stones had lost their original
orientation.
Two cave sites in southern Africa round up this tour of early evidence. The
Swartkrans site is one of many dolomite caves in Gauteng Province, South Africa.
Just across the valley from Sterkfontein, it presents a complementary picture, known
for its robust australopithecines, stone tools and fire-evidence. The cave faces
southeast and overlooks the Blaubank River, but the present conformation of the site
is owed to erosion that has planed off the cave roof (Brain 1981). A key factor in its
formation was the collapse at an early stage of a huge dolomite block, which now
separates the deposits of the inner and outer cave (Brain 1981). Brain’s (1981: 224)
diagrams demonstrate the complex development that can characterise cave formation and infilling. The levels are labelled as Members 1 to 5 in ascending order, in a
series separated by erosional intervals (the older members were formerly known as
the brown and pink breccias; Butzer 1984 gives details). They may have been
deposited in interglacial conditions and were dissected by erosion during cooler
periods (Brain 1981; Clark 1992). Members 13 are all relevant to the early
Pleistocene picture. Member 1 is preserved in two distinct parts, a ‘hanging remnant’
attached to the north wall of the cave, plus an area on the cave floor. It includes
numerous remains of robust australopithecines (Australopithecus/Paranthropus
robustus), along with scarce remains of Homo, stone tools and other fauna. Member 2
was then deposited in an erosional cavity and is highly calcified. It also includes
Homo and similar stone tools, but the robust australopithecines have gone. Member 3,
containing the fire evidence, fills a gully eroded into its surface. In addition to
artefacts and bone, numbers of burnt bones were described by Brain and Sillen
(1988). They come from several layers within Member 3 (sometimes known as the
dark fill). All together there are around 270 burnt bones out of a total of almost
60,000 bones from the Member. Brain (2005) considers that at this time the area was
‘a roofed erosional gully’. From the recurrent finds of bones in different layers he
argues that fires were tended repeatedly in the entrance area of Member 3 and that
some of the burnt bones tended to roll downslope to their eventual place of

Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa 17
deposition. Natural burning can occur on the savanna landscape, as well as in
accumulated plant or guano debris in caves. Brain concedes that natural grass fires
might be expected at the cave mouth. The bones are charred through, however, at
relatively high temperatures, whereas the containing sediments are not. Cutmarks
also attest to human association; significantly, although cutmarks are largely absent
from early South African bone assemblages, including those in Members 1 and 2,
Brain found a few examples along with the burnt material in Member 3. In an
important development Pickering et al. (2005) bring the total up to about 60 pieces,
noting also some limited traces of percussion on the bones, and Pickering (2012) has
recently reported the co-occurrence of cutmarks and burning on four specimens.
Finally, the recurrent nature of the evidence is a further factor arguing in favour of
human fire use.
Although Member 3 at Swartkrans was thought to date to c. 1.01.5 Ma, around
the same range as evidence of burning at Chesowanja and other sites (Figure 2),
continuing research suggests that the age of Member 3 is 0.61.0 Ma, considerably
younger than previously argued (Balter et al. 2008; Herries et al. 2009). Some faunal
elements suggest that the age is at the earlier end of this range (James Brink, pers.
comm.), but the absence of robust australopithecines (already absent in Member 2) is
noteworthy.
Finally, Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa’s Northern Cape Province preserves
fire evidence that may be of comparable age. A large horizontal phreatic tube cave,
more than 100 metres long, this site contains Pleistocene sediments to a depth of
more than 5 metres (Beaumont and Vogel 2006; Chazan et al. 2008; Beaumont 2011;
Berna et al. 2012). The artefact assemblages here extend from the Later Stone Age
possibly as far back as the Oldowan, with the Acheulean well represented through
deeper levels. Berna et al. (2012) report on fire evidence from Excavation I, more
than 30 m from the cave entrance. Level 10 here has Acheulean finds and its
palaeomagnetic record gives a Normal direction, which, with the support of Al/Be
dates, Berna et al. (2012) ascribe to the Jaramillo event, hence giving it an age of
about one million years ago. No hearths are preserved, but microstratigraphic
analysis shows associations of light wood ash and burnt bone fragments throughout
this layer. Temperature determinations are in the range 5007008C, consistent with
campfires (although also with natural fires). The analyses show no evidence of
burning of guano. The direct association with Acheulean, the repeated nature of
burning and the association with bone are all important points. The dating is perhaps
the least secure part of the evidence, since a possible reversed interval in the upper
sequence (Chazan et al. 2008) has not been confirmed (Matmon et al. 2012), placing
the main emphasis on cosmogenic nuclide dates. Although these support the early
age, they are each presented with very large statistical errors, being of the order 1.09
0.2 Ma (Matmon et al. 2012) allowing the outside possibility of a later date. Together,
however, Swartkrans and Wonderwerk present a very similar picture, attested by
different lines of evidence and analyses. Although hearths are not evident, these cases
can be doubted only if one takes repeated natural burning of vegetation in caves as a
regular phenomenon, despite specific evidence to the contrary at Wonderwerk given
that there is no obvious source of plant fuel there other than through human action.
These occurrences are the limit of the evidence of early Pleistocene fire in Africa.
Throughout the Middle Pleistocene, traces of fire remain very rare on African open
sites. Those at Olorgesailie, Kenya, where scattered burnt clasts are found, have been

18 J.A.J. Gowlett and R.W. Wrangham
studied in detail and seem likely to reflect circumstances of natural burning involving the
spontaneous combustion of underground decaying vegetation (Melson and Potts 2002).
There is no doubt, however, that fire was known and used in later stages of the
Acheulean, as shown now exceptionally well by sites in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa. Gesher Benot Ya’aqov, at the crossroads of the Middle East, has been
explicitly regarded as lying on a corridor out of Africa (Goren-Inbar et al. 2000).
Kalambo Falls on Zambia’s border with Tanzania provides unequivocal evidence
from southern Africa. Here not only is charred wood found, but artefacts
opportunistically made with the aid of fire (Clark 2001), as well as an oval area of
burnt clay approximately one metre in diameter (Clark 1969: 160) that indicates a
probable hearth. Important features of the Kalambo Falls setting that recur at
Beeches Pit in England and Gesher Benot Ya’aqov in Israel are that the fire evidence
occurs close to water and that it is repeated at separate levels (Gowlett et al. 2005;
Gowlett 2006; Preece et al. 2006; Alperson-Afil 2008). These features are unusual in
natural fires (cf. Alperson-Afil and Goren-Inbar 2010; Gowlett 2010). Elsewhere
Middle Pleistocene hearths are found in Acheulean levels in caves (such as at
Montagu Cave in South Africa (Keller 1973) or at Qesem in Israel, dated to around
400 kya (Karkanas et al. 2007)), as well as in open sites (such as at Terra Amata in
southern France, a raised beach site dated to c. 300 kya; de Lumley 2009).
In the set of Acheulean finds those from Gesher Benot Ya’aqov are somewhat
earlier than most of the others and have been studied in particular detail (GorenInbar et al. 2004; Alperson-Afil 2008; Alperson-Afil and Goren-Inbar 2010). With
dates of c. 700 kya (occurring close above the Brunhes-Matuyama boundary in the
site sequence), they now fall into a similar time frame as Swartkrans, Wonderwerk
and one other possibly significant find. This comprises fragments of burnt and
calcined bones from Bogatyri (Russia), on the Taman peninsula at the northern end
of the Black Sea, dating to about 900 kya (correlated with the Jaramillo Event on
faunal grounds) (Bosinski 2006).
In an archaeological evaluation of all the earliest finds in Africa, we would note
that there is no certain evidence of hearths. At Koobi Fora and Chesowanja there is
evidence to speak for concentrated burning, closely associated with artefacts. In each
case there is a possible hearth arrangement (Figure 3), but their status is not easily
confirmed this long after the original excavations. The same is true for Gadeb. At
Swartkrans and Wonderwerk the pattern of evidence is highly convincing, but there
is no evidence of hearths and the dates are not certainly above one million years,
though within the range of 200,000 years they begin to fall into a group with
Gesher Benot Ya’aqov, Zhoukoudian and possibly Bogatyri.
Evidence for dietary hypotheses
We are looking here for evidence that is independent of the archaeological fire
record. Archaeologists have tended to dismiss Wrangham’s hypothesis for fire use by
Homo erectus as unsupported by evidence. There are, however, aspects of the
archaeological record that are indirectly relevant and, if not from archaeology,
supporting evidence may come from early hominin ecology and physiology. Hominin
anatomy can be one pointer towards these. The essential elements (that are
reasonably well dated) are encephalisation, tooth reduction and changes in body
size and proportion. These are all long term trends, but with phases of accelerated

Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa 19

Figure 3. The term ‘phantom hearth’ is used to refer to situations where a probable or possible hearth can be mapped, but direct evidence of the burnt
material (e.g. charcoal) is lacking. Here at Chesowanja the ‘Q zone’ in locality GnJi 1/6E is an example of a possible hearth for which alternative
explanations have been set forward (see text). An original colour photograph of the square was blemished by labels. In the left view the labels have been
removed and the finds are shown against a plain background. For ease of comparison, the accompanying plan is inverted in direction to face south.

change. Aiello (1996) noted two steepenings of gradient in encephalisation, at around
1.7 Ma and 0.4 Ma, postulating that the later one coincided with fire use. But with
more recent finds the curve has tended to smooth out (Schoenemann 2006). The key
points appear to be that brain size had already reached 1000 cm3 one million years
ago, that major tooth size reduction in Homo had already happened by 1.7 Ma and
that changes to more modern body form came soon afterwards (being achieved by
1.5 Ma as shown by the Nariokotome specimen (Pontzer et al. 2010). Certainly, the
archaeological record around Lake Turkana shows hominins ranging widely on
landscapes that were often semi-arid and offered no prospect of the kind of stable
diet of fruits and herbs available to chimpanzees (Bunn and Ezzo 1993; Bunn 1994;
Isaac and Behrensmeyer 1997) and much the same can be said for Olduvai
(Blumenschine et al. 2003). These environments did, however, offer opportunities
for broadly based foraging, with an input of meat, as indicated both by cutmarks on
bones and, in some cases, isotopic analysis (Lee Thorp et al. 2010; Copeland et al.
2011), which also suggests major changes of diet in the period 32 Ma. Indeed,
some sites, such as FxJj50, indicate a very substantial meat aspect to the diet (Bunn
et al. 1981; Harris and Isaac 1997). In these drier environments it is inevitable that
carbohydrates were an important further component of consumption, especially in
dry seasons.
There are other aspects of human physiology and genetics that may point to early
human fire use. Fire use is well attested in both the Neanderthal and modern human
stems from at least 400,000 years ago. Yet the two species are closely related, to the
extent of sharing most genetic variation (Green et al. 2010) and it would be
parsimonious * particularly in the light of the common substrate of association of
fire with the Acheulean (Beeches Pit, Gesher Benot Ya’aqov, Kalambo Falls) * to
suggest that fire-use was indeed shared by the common ancestor of the two species,
especially as on present interpretations (Green et al. 2010) Gesher would fall before
the divergence. This argument, mentioned by Alperson-Afil and Goren-Inbar (2010),
is essentially cladistic, but given the great conservatism of material culture
demonstrable in earlier hominins, and also the extreme concentration on a meatbased diet indicated in the Neanderthals (Bocherens et al. 1999), it has some force.
Social hypotheses
Social hypotheses * and the Social Brain hypothesis in particular * can be assessed
against the evidence of hominin fossils, landscapes and various aspects of the
archaeological record. Pleistocene evidence of brain size, and also of group size, are
thus key lines of evidence that may relate to fire use. Larger groups need better social
bonding, and probably more efficient use of food resources, because of the costs of
aggregation. It is thus important to make good use of social time and it is notable
that for humans this is made available as evening time because of a major shift in
sleep-wake parameters * the modern human day approaches twice the length of that
of many primates, with a mere eight hours sleep time and the time of peak attention
coming in the early evening, around 67 pm (for a review see Schmidt et al. 2007;
also Burazeri et al. 2003; Conroy et al. 2005; Gowlett 2010). It seems that this
extended day is engineered through a rotation apart of the parameters of CBT (core
body temperature) and cerebral blood flow (CBFV) (cerebral blood flow velocity)
(Conroy et al. 2005). It is highly likely that it was fire that provided this extension of

Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa 21
daytime, thus generating the selection for biological changes in the circadian rhythm
(Gowlett 2010).
The social brain, and the corollaries of expensive issue and ‘fire time’, give a good
account of what has happened and the finally resulting changes are unarguable.
Again, the question is ‘when?’ If we look for a complex of factors, then it can be
argued that a strong new package is present at 1.0 Ma, which was not fully there at
Dmanisi at 1.7 Ma (Gabunia et al. 2000, 2001): large Homo erectus individuals of
strong body form, with reduced sexual dimorphism and 1000 cm3-sized brains. They
are also associated with several cultural traits that similarly indicate effective social
co-operation: long distance transportation of artefacts, major investment in artefact
manufacture and hunting, or at least butchery, of large animals. These aspects of
high competence may nevertheless go with a ‘bend with it’ path of least resistance in
the use of resources. Overall the complex of linked and repeating elements is so well
established over such large areas as to indicate the consolidation of a new pattern
about 1.5 million years ago, one * we argue * that included the regular use of fire.
Discussion
When the first significant evidence for early fire in Africa was published (Gowlett
et al. 1981) for many observers the picture did not fit. In a warm savanna landscape,
what need would australopithecines have had for fire? Neither their physical nor their
socioecological adaptations would demand it since they could be popularly seen as
something like upright chimpanzees. Now, the picture has somewhat turned round.
Chesowanja is seen to be younger than the earliest occupation of Eurasia, over huge
areas, to at least 408N (Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen 2001; Gabunia et al. 2001; Stiner
2002; Zhu et al. 2004). That settlement was driven forward by early Homo, already
encephalised far beyond the ape-australopithecine baseline. Although robust
australopithecines have been found at Chesowanja and Swartkrans, there are strong
reasons for supposing that the archaeological occurrences at both sites were
generated by Homo erectus. It was certainly Homo that emerged as master of the
Acheulean tradition, dating now to as early as 1.76 Ma (Lepre et al. 2011). The
subsequent disappearance of the robust australopithecines had no visible effect on
the archaeological record.
There is not sufficient resolution in the record to see directions of movement in
and out of Africa in the early days (cf. Dennell 2003), but a priori it might be equally
plausible to see fire use coming from the north, or from out of Africa. Such a useful
adaptation, one would suppose, would ‘spread like fire’ across the Old World, but
this may not have been the case in terms of similarity of adaptation and use.
The major difficulty for one simple all-embracing fire hypothesis is that fire use is
not apparent in Europe * either in the early stages at Dmanisi * or particularly
from 0.80.5 Ma, where the record is good enough that one would expect to see it.
There are no traces of fire, for instance, at Atapuerca, La Caune d’Arago or
Boxgrove, nor in early Italian sites such as Notarchirico and Isernia (Roberts and
Parfitt 1999; Villa 2001; Bermúdez de Castro et al. 2004; de Lumley 2006; Roebroeks
and Villa 2011). Together, these sites preserve many thousands of bones, none of
which are charred. Our hypotheses must accommodate this puzzling evidence, either
showing it to be a false impression, or fitting it in as part of the overall scenario. Here
we attempt this through a scheme of three propositions:

22 J.A.J. Gowlett and R.W. Wrangham






In the first place fire would have been used as a resource of nature by early
Homo or earlier hominin taxa (e.g. Burton 2009); when early Homo spread out
around the world, probably c. 2.0 Ma, this might still have been the state *
use of natural fire as ‘consumers’ with limited active control;
In drier zones of the tropics and subtropics the familiarity with fire offered by
regular lightning strikes and forest fires would give the benefit of cooking
plants and small animal resources, as stated by the cooking hypothesis. In this
context, fire control skills would rapidly improve until fire use was widespread
in these domains up to c. 308
Further north, the scarcity of lightning strikes and the severe costs of
accidental fire loss would create both far greater challenges to human
occupation and selective pressures for dealing with these, the two factors
perhaps operating to influence and constrain patterns of settlement.

For some colleagues point (3) has the implication that if we cannot see fire-use, it
must have been totally absent up to the time when it becomes readily visible 400,000
years ago. But we know from cases such as that of reindeer butchery at Arago in
southern France 550,000 years ago (de Lumley et al. 2004; Moigne et al. 2006) that
some hominins were already adapted to extreme cold conditions by this time. To
postulate that they could manage without fire is to say that they had other strategies
for preparing uncooked fat and meat, for maintaining warmth during the ice-age
winter and avoiding predators. These are problems that we have not seen solved in
debate.
A further difficulty with the dichotomy of points (2) and (3) is that it postulates a
geographic difference that is unlikely in the face of all other evidence. Could people
really have lived for as much as a million years without fire in the north, because it
was difficult to manage when to the south it appears to have been under control? If
so, they would also have been foregoing the major selective advantages of cooking.
There is a possible alternative, namely that fire was in use in the north, but
precisely because it was difficult to manage fires were set and maintained in
particular favourable contexts, which almost never survive. The preserved fire
evidence at Beeches Pit in eastern Britain may hint at this pattern, as may that from
Schöningen in Germany (Gowlett et al. 2005; Thieme 2005), where the hearths were
not in the main occupation, but at the side of it. Those at Beeches Pit were by a water
edge * still a favoured location for fires * and appear to have burned on repeated
occasions, possibly for long periods. In Europe the preservation of such contexts is
almost non-existent, except where there has been interglacial tufa deposition. (The
same is largely true for southern Africa, where Florisbad is another example of a
spring site preserving a hearth; Henderson 2001). The other main context of fires in
Europe is in caves. In the Middle Palaeolithic hearths are numerous in caves (e.g. at
Bolomor or Abric Romani in Spain; Pastó et al. 2000; Fernández Peris 2007), but it
may be that the necessary control for setting fires in northern caves did not exist until
around half a million years ago, i.e. that fire could be maintained only in other
specific settings on the landscape (Gowlett 2006). Then, rather than butchery taking
place at the fireside, meat may have been butchered and taken to the fire wherever
that was best placed. Both Homo erectus’s known propensity for transporting
artefacts and the modern hunter-gatherer practice of transporting meat (O’Connell
et al. 1988) make this a feasible scenario.

Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa 23
Without doubt in the north natural fire was far less available, because of the
minimal number of lightning strikes (see, for example, the lightning maps produced
by the United States of America’s National Space and Aeronautics Administration
(NASA 2012). In default of a regular re-supply from lightning-induced fires, new
social and cognitive skills would be needed to establish a full network of fire control
across the landscape. Making comparison with other cultural traits, we might expect
intensification in fire-use over a long period. Rolland (2000, 2004), de Lumley (2006)
and Roebroeks and Villa (2011) all argue for major change around 400,000 years
ago. If so, following our arguments, such major change is likely to represent not the
beginning of fire use in the north, but a new flexibility in its maintenance and
transport.
This set of propositions does not avoid all difficulties in the pattern of evidence *
and absence of evidence * but it does grapple with the apparently different records
in Africa and Europe and offers a tentative explanation that emphasises the extreme
vagaries of preservation.
Conclusions
We have sought to explore the early phenomena of fire in the context of human
evolution in Africa, and in comparison with Europe, necessarily omitting many of
the complexities of later fire-related behaviour. We conclude from the evidence of
several disciplines that continuous fire-use goes back at least 1.5 million years,
towards and perhaps during the time of the first major increase in encephalisation in
early Homo. From several viewpoints we suggest that the use of fire by hominins
from the early Pleistocene onwards is the most parsimonious working hypothesis,
subject to continued testing.
In the most favourable circumstances archaeology is able to recognise humanly
controlled fire. This is especially the case where single artefacts are part-burnt or
where hearth conformations are distinctly visible in association with artefacts
(Figure 4). Repeated burning events in a restricted locality also carry weight. It is
also plain that such circumstances occur very rarely and result from exceptional
preservation conditions. In consequence, archaeology does not provide a general
picture of early fire use, but highlights particular moments of it.
The emphasis on hearths means that archaeology is tending to ‘prosecute’ on the
basis of happenings that are inherently rare. Consequently the most realistic framing
of a general picture should come from several disciplines. It is then extremely
important to distinguish between working hypotheses * as predicated from the
convergences of disciplines * and established fact. Other disciplines, such as
astronomy, are well able to deal with working hypotheses that are gradually accepted
or rejected through an increasing factual basis.
Established fact on its own does not allow us to place human control of fire
beyond one million years ago. The strongest network of evidence (Swartkrans,
Wonderwerk, Gesher Benot Ya’aqov, Taman, Zhoukoudian) gives us a picture at
around the Lower/Middle Pleistocene boundary (roughly 800,000 years). By then,
fire use may have been very widespread. The questions that we draw attention to are
whether it goes back further and whether there were lacunae in its use. The older
picture has to be sustained by general arguments and by the sites of Chesowanja,
Koobi Fora and possibly Gadeb. In this context other lines of evidence *

give the most secure evidence of localised fire control. Beyond this, the conformation of
hearths and their positions in sites and on landscapes give further useful indications.

particularly the cooking hypothesis and the idea of the social brain * provide an
independent and broader picture. They do not even need to be pinned to particular
time points: the strong gradient from early Homo around 2.0 Ma to fully fledged
Homo erectus long before 1.0 Ma provides both context and need enough for many
new adaptations, among which fire use was one of the most crucial.
