The cooking hypothesis proposes that a diet of cooked food was responsible for diverse morphological
and behavioral changes in human evolution. However, it does not predict whether a preference for
cooked food evolved before or after the control of ﬁre. This question is important because the greater the
preference shown by a raw-food-eating hominid for the properties present in cooked food, the more
easily cooking should have been adopted following the control of ﬁre. Here we use great apes to model
food preferences by Paleolithic hominids. We conducted preference tests with various plant and animal
foods to determine whether great apes prefer food items raw or cooked. We found that several
populations of captive apes tended to prefer their food cooked, though with important exceptions. These
results suggest that Paleolithic hominids would likewise have spontaneously preferred cooked food to
raw, exapting a pre-existing preference for high-quality, easily chewed foods onto these cooked items.
The results, therefore, challenge the hypothesis that the control of ﬁre preceded cooking by a signiﬁcant
period.

Introduction
The advent of cooking, whether it occurred at the origin of Homo
erectus or during the Middle Paleolithic, has been hypothesized to
have had diverse effects on human physiology and behavior (Coon,
1962; Brace et al., 1987; Wrangham et al., 1999; Wrangham and
Conklin-Brittain, 2003; Lucas et al., 2006; Wrangham, 2006).
Because cooking reduces food toughness and, thus, would have
allowed easier chewing and digestion, a diet of cooked food appears
to have contributed to the reduction of tooth size and gut size in
hominids (Aiello and Wheeler, 1995; Lucas, 2004). Small guts
probably explain why modern humans fare poorly on raw diets
(Koebnick et al., 1999) and why no human societies live without
cooking (Wrangham and Conklin-Brittain, 2003).
Such indications of biological adaptation to cooking raise the
possibility that a preference for eating cooked food is an adaptation
rather than an exaptation (i.e., that the preference for cooked food
evolved subsequent to the adoption of cooked diets). If so, the
problem of how cooking arose is relatively complex because
cooking would not necessarily have been adopted quickly after the
control of ﬁre. As Stahl (1989: 19) suggested, ‘‘use of controlled ﬁre

as a source of warmth may have preceded systematic use of ﬁre in
food preparation by thousands or hundreds of thousands of years.’’
Similarly, Bellomo (1994) proposed that when ﬁre was ﬁrst
controlled it was used for heat, light, and defense against predators
but not for cooking.
Alternatively, cooked food may have properties that hominoid
primates would ﬁnd desirable even without any evolutionary
exposure to cooking. If so, the control of ﬁre would be expected to lead
rapidly to cooking, as often implied or suggested (e.g., Oakley, 1963;
Clark and Harris,1985; Brace,1995; Rolland, 2004; Wrangham, 2006).
No data are currently available to directly distinguish between
these hypotheses, but human systems for food perception appear to
be generally similar to those in other mammals, including primates
(Dominy et al., 2001; Hladik et al., 2003). As such, the ﬁndings that
rats have been shown to prefer cooked to raw starch (Ramirez,
1992) and cats prefer cooked to raw meat, provided they are familiar with cooked meat (Bradshaw et al., 2000), would suggest
that this preference may have been conserved in primates. Yet no
past work has investigated this question speciﬁcally.
What has been shown is that both nonhuman primates and
other animals tend to prefer properties that are produced by
cooking. Numerous species prefer foods that are higher in sugar,
and cooking raises sugar availability in the mouth by increasing the
susceptibility of starch to amylase degradation (Svihus et al., 2005;
Tester et al., 2006). Apes in captivity have also been shown to ﬁnely
discriminate the levels of sugar, in addition to tannins and salt in
various foods or aqueous solutions (Hladik and Simmen, 1996;

V. Wobber et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 55 (2008) 340–348

Laska et al., 1999; Hladik et al., 2003; Simmen and Charlot, 2003). In
the wild as well, food choices of nonhuman primates, including
apes, are well-predicted by their sugar or tannin contents,
suggesting that individuals might be sensitive to these properties of
a food if they were changed by cooking (Leighton, 1993; ConklinBrittain et al., 1998; Wrangham et al., 1998). Further, cooking
increases the availability of glutamate, responsible for the umami
taste preference (Sasaki et al., 2007), and umami taste receptors are
found widely in invertebrates and vertebrates (Bellisle, 1999).
Finally, some of the textural properties to which monkeys respond
are the same as those used by humans, such as viscosity, temperature, fat content, and grittiness. Perception of textural properties
has in some cases been shown to be mediated in humans and
nonhuman primates via similar neural mechanisms (Kadohisa
et al., 2004, 2005; Rolls, 2005).
Such evidence indicates that the mechanisms of human food
perception are fundamentally similar to those in other primates.
Nevertheless, species preferences for any given food are
unpredictable (Hladik and Simmen, 1996; Dominy et al., 2001;
Hladik et al., 2003). It is, therefore, not known whether the
chemical and textural changes induced by cooking would have
caused Paleolithic hominids to show increased or decreased
preference. However, great apes offer an opportunity to assess
whether hominoids have a tendency to spontaneously prefer
cooked or raw foods.
Accordingly, in this paper we report on experiments designed to
establish whether great apes have an inherent preference for raw or
cooked food. We tested apes’ preferences by providing the
individual being tested with a choice between a raw and a cooked
option, then measuring how many times it picked each item. We
used three different categories of food to assess apes’ preferences:
tubers, meat, and fruit. Each individual food might have a different
prediction based on the properties of that food which are altered by
cooking, thus using this variety of items allowed us to gain some
insight into what factors might be inﬂuencing subjects’ selectivity.
In addition to testing general taste preferences in different cooked
and raw foods, in experiment 2 we also tested a few hypotheses of
why subjects might prefer cooked food. We did so by manipulating
the textural properties of the foods in this experiment, juxtaposing
the potential taste and tactile changes caused by cooking to attempt
to discern what factors would be selected by subjects in a potential
preference for cooked food.
Experiment 1: do apes prefer cooked tubers?
In this experiment, we investigated chimpanzees’ preferences
for cooked versus raw tubers. Tubers are an important class of food
for many hunter-gatherers and have likely been signiﬁcant during
human evolution (O’Connell et al., 1999; Laden and Wrangham,
2005; Perry et al., 2007). They are also a category of food where the
items are signiﬁcantly changed in both nutritional and textural
quality by cooking (Wandsnider, 1997; Wrangham et al., 1999;
Laden and Wrangham, 2005). Tubers are often improved
nutritionally by being cooked, since heat gelatinizes starch granules
that may otherwise be incompletely digested (Ayankunbi et al.,
1991; Kingman and Englyst, 1994; Tester and Sommerville, 2000;
Smith et al., 2001; Lucas, 2004). Though chimpanzees in the wild
occasionally eat raw tubers (Lanjouw, 2002; Hernandez-Aguilar
et al., 2007), tubers are generally not elements of the chimpanzee
diet. They therefore represent a relatively unfamiliar type of food
for chimpanzees, for which a strong bias towards the raw or cooked
items is unlikely to have been selected. The subjects in this
experiment had previously tasted our test itemsdcarrots, sweet
potatoes, and white potatoesdin both their cooked and raw forms,
reducing the possibility that simple fear of novelty might shift
preferences away from the cooked items.

Methods
Fourteen chimpanzees (for age and sex, see Table 1) were
subjects for this experiment and were housed at the ﬁeld station at
the Yerkes Regional Primate Center in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, when
they were tested. The fourteen chimpanzees had various rearing
histories, with two individuals (Peony and Ericka) raised in
a human family as young infants. At Yerkes all subjects were fed on
a diet of monkey chow and various fruits and vegetables provided
throughout each day. In the past, all of the chimpanzees had been
fed various cooked foods, including the ones they were tested with
in the current study. Water was available ad libitum during testing.
Tubers were sliced across their diameter and baked in the oven at
approximately 245 degrees Celsius ( C) until they were soft/edible
to a human. All items in this and the subsequent experiments were
at room temperature when presented.
Subjects were brought one at a time into a testing room. Each
individual was presented with one food preference test consisting
of ﬁve trials per day. In their ﬁrst session (on the ﬁrst test day),
subjects were given a choice between cooked and uncooked sweet
potato (Ipomoea batatas), then in their second session a choice
between cooked and uncooked white potato (Solanum tuberosum),
and ﬁnally in their third session cooked and uncooked carrots
(Daucus carota sativus). Before each testing session the individual
was given an introduction in which they were presented with two
pieces of uncooked food and two pieces of cooked food of
approximately equal size (approximately 2.5 cm diameter slices of
carrot and 6.5 cm diameter slices of potato). After the subject
ﬁnished eating these pieces of food the test session began.
The experimenter held a cooked piece of food in one hand and
an uncooked piece of food in the other so that the subject could
look, smell, and/or touch both pieces of food (the food pieces were
10–15 cm apart from each other). Once the subject had inspected
the food the experimenter then slowly moved her hands out of the
subject’s reach while also moving them apart and stopped when
the food pieces were 50–60 cm apart from each other. Once the
food pieces were separated by this distance, they were moved back
within reach of the subject. The subject was then allowed to touch
one of the two food pieces, and was given the food piece he/she ﬁrst
touched. This procedure was repeated ﬁve times for each subject in
each session while the position of each food type was alternated
each trial and the position presented in the ﬁrst trial was
counterbalanced across subjects. Subjects’ choices were scored live
by the experimenter.

Results
Table 1 presents the food choices in each of the three testing
sessions and subjects’ overall choices in all three test sessions
combined. Over the three test sessions 6 of the 14 subjects had an
individual preference for cooked food and one subject had an individual preference for uncooked food [p < 0.05, binomial probability, one-tailed]. When all three test sessions were considered
together, as a group, the subjects showed a signiﬁcant preference
for the cooked items [one sample t-test, t(13) ¼ 3.730, p ¼ 0.003]. As
a group, when each food type is considered separately, subjects
preferentially chose the cooked carrot and sweet potato [carrot:
t(13) ¼ 2.502, p ¼ 0.026; sweet potato: t(13) ¼ 6.104, p < 0.001] but
showed no preference for the cooked or raw items with respect to
the white potato (Fig. 1). When subjects’ food choices with the three
different food types were compared there was no signiﬁcant
difference across food items between the amount of cooked food
that subjects chose (repeated measures ANOVA).
Discussion
Overall, chimpanzees in this experiment preferred cooked
tubers to raw tubers. These results are the ﬁrst to show a preference
by chimpanzees for cooked food, but the lack of preference for
cooked white potatoes shows that they do not prefer all types of
cooked food. Subjects were hesitant to take the initial pieces of
either the raw or cooked white potato, providing a potential
explanation for their indifference in that this item may simply have
been inherently less interesting than the carrot and the sweet
potato. Alternatively, there may not have been signiﬁcant enough
ﬂavor distinctions between cooked and white potato for subjects to
differentiate between the two. Neophobia was unlikely to be
a factor in the white potato or the other conditions, as subjects had
previously eaten all of the food items used.
In the next experiment we sought to investigate what elements
of food items might inﬂuence preferences in apes, since it was
unclear from the present experiment whether apes preferred the
cooked taste of the items they chose selectively, or whether tactile
factors were more important in determining their choices. To
distinguish between these factors, we manipulated the textural
properties of the food items used. We also included the other three
great ape species to obtain a broader sample of apes’ preferences.
Experiment 2: why do apes prefer cooked food?
In this experiment, we aimed to investigate whether subjects in
experiment 1 preferred the cooked food because of potential taste

changes resulting from the nutrient changes of cooking, or whether
other factors contributed to such a preference. Potential factors
changed by cooking other than taste which may have affected
preferences included: 1) food being made less tough by cooking,
deﬁning toughness as the ease of propagating a fracture in
a piece of food (Lucas, 2004), and 2) food requiring less chewing
before swallowing. Ease of chewing is distinct from toughness in
that, in this instance, selectivity acts not on the texture but on the
relative speed at which one can eat, which is a function of texture
but also other factors, such as particle size which can be changed by
cooking and processing. Thus, it was necessary to tease apart
whether apes used the textural index of toughness or simply the
reduction in the amount of chewing required in their selection of
different items.
To test these two hypotheses, we presented apes with choices
between food items that had been manipulated along these two
factors. We used carrots as a test item, because chimpanzees had
shown a strong preference for this item in its cooked state in
experiment 1. We presented, alongside cubes of carrot, carrots
which had been mashed (using a blender) to represent an item
which was both less tough and required little chewing before
swallowing, and carrots which had been grated (using a standard
cheese grater) to represent an item which would require less
chewing before swallowing because of decreased particle size but
which was no less tough than the regular pieces of carrot.
We presented the subjects with the following six pairwise
comparisons (see Methods for exact size of pieces used and cooking
speciﬁcations): raw whole versus cooked whole (abbreviated
henceforth as RW-CW), raw grated versus cooked whole (RG-CW),
raw mashed versus cooked whole (RM-CW), cooked grated versus
cooked whole (CG-CW), cooked mashed versus cooked whole (CMCW), and cooked grated versus cooked mashed (CG-CM). We tested
three potential hypotheses governing performance in these
conditions, the predictions of which are depicted in Table 2 (along
with the actual results for each condition). These hypotheses are
not mutually exclusive, as multiple factors could shape performance in each condition; rather, these conditions were designed to
assess the relative importance of each in selecting food items.
Hypothesis 1: prefer cooked taste
If subjects use the potential nutrient and general taste changes
accompanied by cooking as a stronger index of selection than
textural factors, they should prefer the cooked food to raw in each
of the conditions juxtaposing a cooked and raw item, and should be
indifferent in the conditions with two cooked items.
Hypothesis 2: prefer less tough
If subjects select mainly on the basis of toughness, they should
prefer the cooked item to raw when both are cubes (CW over RW)
since cooked carrot is less tough than raw carrot. Further, they should
prefer the CW item to the RG item, since grating does not reduce the
toughness of the raw carrot. In the case of the CG item, subjects should
be indifferent between this and the CW item, because again
the grating should not change toughness and in this instance both
items are cooked and, thus, should have similar degrees of toughness.
In the RM-CW condition, subjects should either be indifferent
between RM and CW, since in this instance the raw item is decreased
in toughness, or should prefer the RM to the CW, since we did not
measure the exact degree to which mashing reduced toughness and,
thus, could not say whether we in fact made the RM less tough than
the CW (we merely aimed to reduce toughness in the raw item rather
than to perfectly match it with the texture of the cooked item, hence
this small degree of imprecision in the predictions of the hypothesis).
Finally, according to this hypothesis subjects should prefer the less
tough item when both items presented in the choice are cooked
(CM over CW and CM over CG).

Hypotheses in experiment 2 as to which carrot item subjects should prefer depending on what factor they use to form their preferences, and the actual results for each
condition. ‘‘Indif’’ represents a condition where subjects should be indifferent between the two items. The abbreviations for the carrot pieces are as follows: RW ¼ raw whole,
CW ¼ cooked whole, RG ¼ raw grated, RM ¼ raw mashed, CG ¼ cooked grated, and CM ¼ cooked mashed.

Hypothesis 3: prefer less chewing
If subjects select based on reducing the amount of chewing
required, they should prefer the cooked item to the raw when both
are cubes (CW over RW), since the less tough cooked carrots should
require less chewing than the raw carrots. When the cooked cube is
presented with a texturally manipulated raw item (RG or RM),
subjects should either prefer the easier to chew item (with both the
grated and mashed being easier to chew than the plain cube of the
raw item), or be indifferent, since again we could not quantify how
much the grating and mashing increased ease of chewing relative
to cooking. Subjects should also prefer the texturally manipulated
items when these items are presented along with the cooked whole
item (CG over CW and CM over CW), since cooking increases the
ease of chewing of both items, but the textural manipulations
further augment the ease of chewing. Finally, subjects should be
indifferent when offered two texturally manipulated items
(CG-CM) since both will be relatively easy to chew.
Methods
Twenty-three individuals (fourteen chimpanzees, three bonobos, two gorillas, and four orangutans) at the Wolfgang Koehler
Primate Research Center (WKPRC) at the Leipzig Zoo participated in
this experiment, although not all individuals participated in all
conditions. The apes at the WKPRC receive cooked food as a part of
their normal diet, with cooked beef and pieces of bread supplementing their regimen of fruit and vegetables. These apes are
occasionally (less than once a month) fed cooked carrot but do not
receive any cooked fruit or vegetables on a regular basis.
In this experiment, the food items were placed on a sliding table
(rather than being held in the experimenter’s ﬁsts as in experiment
1), with the sliding function of the table enabling the food options
to be kept far enough away that subjects could not obtain them
until the moment of choice. The subject sat across from the
experimenter, behind a Plexiglas panel that had holes at the height
of the table through which the subject could extend its ﬁngers to
make a choice. The experimenter began each trial by placing small
squares of plastic on the two sides of the table, lined up with holes
in the Plexiglas. Each square of plastic corresponded to a certain
food item, so that the tastes of various items were not mixed by
placing them in the same location on the table.
After the experimenter placed the plastic squares, she offered
subjects a ‘‘taste’’ piece of each food item (see below for piece sizes).
She ﬁrst offered them a small piece of the left food item and
subsequently placed a larger ‘‘choice’’ piece of that item on the left
plastic square, then offered the subject a small piece of the right
item and placed the choice item on the right-side plastic square.
Subjects were required to take these taste items in order for a trial
to begin, ensuring their motivation and reminding them what
items they were choosing between since it was not necessarily
visually apparent. Subjects received the six conditions mentioned
above: RW-CW, RG-CW, RM-CW, CG-CW, CM-CW, and CG-CM. If
subjects did not take the taste items for a given condition before

every trial, they did not continue with that condition. However,
they did continue with the other conditions in which they
participated, leading to slightly different sample sizes for each
condition.
Subjects were tested in two different sessions that occurred on
two different days. On each test day, subjects were presented with
24 trials, four of each condition. Thus, overall, there were eight
trials for each condition. The order in which conditions were
presented and the side on which each food item appeared were
counterbalanced within and across subjects.
For the ‘‘whole’’ conditions, the piece offered was a 2 cm3 cube
of either raw or cooked carrot. The carrot in the ‘‘grated’’ conditions
was grated using a standard cheese grater, and the amount given
matched the size of the cube. The ‘‘mashed’’ conditions involved
carrot which had been put in a blender, along with one-half cup
water to allow some congealing of the mixture. The amount of
mashed carrot given again matched the size of the cube. Cooked
items were boiled for ﬁve minutes, before being either grated or
mashed, respectively.
Results
Subjects’ individual choices are shown below in Table 3, with
the general result of each condition and how this matches with the
predictions of the hypotheses shown in Table 2. Subjects signiﬁcantly preferred the cooked item to the raw when both items were
cubes [RW-CW: one sample t-test, t(22) ¼ 4.212, p < 0.001] and
when the raw item was grated [RG-CW: t(16) ¼ 11.579, p < 0.001],
but were indifferent between the RM and CW items. Thus, the
results of these three conditions supported the ‘‘prefer softer’’
hypothesis, since subjects preferred the CW to raw items except
when it was paired with the mashed item. However, the results of
the CG-CW and CM-CW conditions did not support this hypothesis,
as subjects signiﬁcantly preferred the CW [t(16) ¼ 11.579, p <
0.001], and were indifferent to the choice between CM and CW.
Finally, subjects strongly preferred the mashed carrot to the grated
carrot [CG-CM: t(16) ¼ 4.045, p ¼ 0.001; see Table 2 for how these
results ﬁt in with the hypotheses].
The same trends seen in group averages can be seen when
examining the number of individuals in each group who showed an
individual preference for a given item, as revealed by a binomial
test of their performancedin this instance, only individuals who
chose a given item on eight out of eight trials would be considered
as showing a signiﬁcant preference (p < 0.05) for that item. Nine
individuals signiﬁcantly preferred the cooked item by this measure
in the RW-CW condition, as did nine individuals in the RG-CW
condition (though not the same nine individuals). Five individuals
showed signiﬁcant preferences for the CW over both the RM and
CM (the same ﬁve individuals showed signiﬁcant preferences in
both conditions).
Species differences could not be assessed using an ANOVA due
to the small sample sizes in the bonobo and gorilla groups, but
qualitative analysis of individual performance suggested

chimpanzee and nonchimpanzee groups for each condition
revealed that in most conditions chimpanzees chose the cooked
whole option signiﬁcantly more often than the other species
[independent samples t-test, RG-CW: t(15) ¼ 2.084, p ¼ 0.055;
RM-CW: t(16) ¼ 5.896, p < 0.001; CG-CW: t(15) ¼ 2.766, p ¼ 0.014;
CM-CW: t(16) ¼ 4.464, p < 0.001; Fig. 2].
There were no signiﬁcant differences in subjects’ preferences
between their two test sessions, as shown by a paired sample t-test
comparing each individual’s performance on each condition in the
two sessions.

Discussion
Overall, subjects preferred the cooked piece of carrot to the raw
piece of carrot in the one condition where textural properties were
not manipulated, replicating and extending the ﬁnding from
experiment 1 to the other great apes. In the grated condition,
subjects generally preferred the cooked whole option, and in the
mashed condition subjects were mainly indifferent between
cooked and raw options. There were species differences in these
conditions, in that chimpanzees were less inclined to choose the
mashed or the grated options than were the other species. Overall,
subjects preferred the mashed carrot to the grated, with all species
showing a dislike for the grated option. These results make it

difﬁcult to distinguish between the ‘‘cooked taste’’ and ‘‘prefer
softer’’ hypotheses.
The species differences found here may have reﬂected distinctions in neophobia rather than in actual taste preference, though
taste distinctions between species would not be unexpected given
past work showing differing thresholds for various nutrients across
apes (Simmen and Charlot, 2003). Greater neophobia in chimpanzees was suggested by the fact that ﬁve chimpanzees refused to
participate in either the grated or mashed conditions, whereas only
one of the other apes refused (Table 3). This population of
chimpanzees had been shown in previous work to take novel food
items fairly readily (Addessi and Visalberghi, 2006), but it is
possible that the novel textures of the carrot created neophobia to
a greater degree. Though capuchins have been shown to be less
neophobic towards familiar foods manipulated in their visual and
olfactory properties than towards completely novel foods
(Visalberghi and Addessi, 2000), it is possible that chimpanzees
differ in this preference. Further, the chimpanzees at the WKPRC
were in a biomedical laboratory prior to their arrival at the Leipzig
Zoo, while this was not the case for the other apes, which have lived
in zoos their entire lives. This provides a potential explanation for
the heightened neophobia among chimpanzees due to their
background with a restricted diet and numerous potentially
frightening novel stimuli.
Because of the possible effects of neophobia in the present
experiment, we designed the next experiment to better control the
novelty of the items presented, and to extend the ﬁndings of
cooked preferences to other food groups.
Experiment 3: do apes prefer all cooked foods?
This experiment provided great apes with choices between raw
and cooked meat, and raw and cooked apple (Malus domestica). We
controlled for neophobia in this experiment because one of these
items was familiar in its raw form (apple) and the other was
familiar in its cooked form (meat). Thus, this juxtaposed preferences determined by taste/texture and those which would be
determined by familiarity with the test items.
Methods
Fifteen chimpanzees, ﬁve bonobos, two gorillas, and ﬁve
orangutans at the WKPRC participated in experiment 3. The procedure for this experiment was similar to that of experiment 2, with
a few exceptions. Again, the sliding table was used, and subjects
were offered ‘‘taste’’ pieces of each food item before each trial.

V. Wobber et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 55 (2008) 340–348

However, in the previous experiment, subjects were required to
take this taste piece on every trial in order to continue with that
trial, while in this experiment the different pieces of food could be
visually discriminated (using color, rigidity) so if subjects took the
taste piece on the ﬁrst trial, they continued with all trials even if
they did not take future taste pieces. If subjects refused to even take
one taste piece of a given food item, they did not continue with
trials of that food item but continued with the other item. Thus,
some subjects only participated in either the meat or the apple
conditions.
Subjects were again tested in two different sessions which
occurred on two different days. For each session, subjects received
8 meat trials followed by 8 apple trials (or vice versa), thus resulting
in 16 trials per session and 16 total trials for each condition across
the two sessions. Thus each subject received 16 trials of raw versus
cooked meat and 16 trials of raw versus cooked apple, with meat
and apple never being presented together in the same trial. The
order of conditions for each session (eight meat trials ﬁrst versus
eight apple trials ﬁrst) and the side on which each food item
appeared were again counterbalanced within and between
subjects.
For both the meat and the apple, the cooked items were boiled
for 10 min. Each food item was cut into 2 cm3 cubes. The meat used
was beef, which subjects were familiar with in its cooked form.
Both cooked and raw pieces of apple were cut so as not to have any
skin. As in the previous experiment, pieces of plastic were placed
on the table so as not to cross-contaminate food items.
Results
The results for each individual subject are shown below in Table 4.
Overall, subjects signiﬁcantly preferred the cooked meat pieces [one
sample t-test, t(17) ¼ 6.735, p < 0.001], but chose the cooked and raw
pieces of apple equally. Subjects also chose the cooked beef
signiﬁcantly more often than they themselves chose the cooked
apple (for those individuals who participated in both conditions),
suggesting that subjects were distinguishing between the two foods
rather than certain individuals being cooked-biased and others not
[paired sample t-test, t(16) ¼ 2.765, p ¼ 0.014]. In looking at the
number of individuals who signiﬁcantly preferred each item
(p < 0.05 with a binomial test; in this instance, a signiﬁcant
preference was 13 or more out of 16 trials), a higher percentage of
individuals preferred the cooked meat than individuals who
preferred the cooked apple, with 11 out of 18 individuals (61.1%)
signiﬁcantly preferring cooked meat and only six out of 26 (23.1%)
preferring cooked apple. No individuals signiﬁcantly preferred raw
meat, but two individuals (7.7%) preferred raw apple to cooked apple.
The two subjects who preferred the raw apple also preferred the
cooked meat, suggesting a potential effect of neophobia in these
individuals since these were the two familiar items.
As in the previous experiment, species comparisons with an
ANOVA were not possible. However, again, distinctions between
the chimpanzees and the other apes were apparent in the number
of individuals showing signiﬁcant preferences in each condition.
Every one of the 8 chimpanzee subjects participating in the meat
condition showed a signiﬁcant preference for cooked meat,
whereas only 3 of the 10 other subjects did so. In contrast, 3 of 15
chimpanzee individuals preferred the cooked apple while 3 of the
11 other apes did so, suggesting that species differences were not as
large a factor in this condition. Mean group performance also
supported the notion that chimpanzees chose the cooked meat
signiﬁcantly more often than did individuals of the other species
[independent samples t-test, t(16) ¼ 3.722, p ¼ 0.002], though
both groups signiﬁcantly chose the cooked meat when analyzed
separately [one sample t-tests, chimpanzees: t(7) ¼ 29.000,
p < 0.001; nonchimpanzees: t(9) ¼ 3.192, p ¼ 0.011; Fig. 3]. No

Since not every subject took the taste piece every time, analyses
were performed to compare the subjects that took the taste piece
on every trial to those that took it on at least one trial but then did
not consistently take the taste piece over the course of the session.
There was a signiﬁcant difference between these two groups in the
meat condition, with subjects who did not always take the taste
piece (i.e., refused to take the raw piece as a taste item) choosing
the cooked item signiﬁcantly more often than subjects who always
took the taste piece of the raw item [independent samples t-test,
t(16) ¼ 4.177, p ¼ 0.001]. These distinctions in fact fell exactly along
species lines, with 10 individuals only sometimes taking the taste
piece in the meat condition, these being the 8 chimpanzee and 2
gorilla subjects, and the 8 subjects from the other two species
always taking the taste pieces. In the apple condition, there was no
distinction between subjects who always took the taste piece and
those who did not take it consistently.
Discussion
Apes in this experiment preferred the cooked beef to the raw
beef, but showed no discrimination between raw and cooked apple.
These preferences were constant across two separate test sessions,
and there were differences between species in that chimpanzees
chose the cooked meat signiﬁcantly more than did the other
species.
These results suggested that neophobia was not the sole factor
affecting subjects’ performance in previous experiments, as
subjects in this experiment did not selectively choose the familiar
item in the apple condition (the raw item) but rather showed
indifference between the raw and cooked options. This indifference
is somewhat logical, as apple can be fairly easily eaten and digested
in its raw form as compared to raw meat. As such, it may have been
that, similar to the white potato in experiment 1, there was not
enough distinction between the cooked and raw apple to cause
subjects to have a signiﬁcant preference. Thus, these results further
supported the notion that apes tend to prefer cooked food to raw,
but potentially only when there are signiﬁcant changes induced by
cooking.
Though these results indicate that neophobia was not
responsible for the apes’ response to cooked apples, neophobia
might have nevertheless inﬂuenced their response to raw beef. In
order to address the effects of neophobia in the meat condition, in
the next experiment we tested a population of chimpanzees that
was equally unfamiliar with cooked and raw meat.
Experiment 4: do chimpanzees prefer novel cooked items?
This experiment again provided subjects with a choice between
cooked and raw beef. We tested chimpanzees that were not given
meat as a part of their regular diet, and as far as was known had
never eaten cooked meat (see Methods section below for a more
detailed description of these chimpanzees’ history and diet).
Methods
Ten individuals from the Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Sanctuary
in Congo Republic participated in this study. Because these animals
arrived at the sanctuary from unknown conditions, usually having
been conﬁscated or found as orphans, we cannot be sure whether
they had ever eaten cooked meat in their lifetimes. However, these
chimpanzees are not fed cooked meat as a part of their regular diet,
and since the individuals tested had all been at the sanctuary for at
least ﬁve years at the time of testing and most arrived as infants, it is
reasonable to say that these individuals were equally unfamiliar
with cooked and raw meat. Although somewhat unlikely, it is
possible that the chimpanzees had tasted raw meat by catching

small animals in the forest; thus, if anything the cooked meat would
be more novel to this population. The chimpanzees at Tchimpounga
do receive cooked plantains and rice on a regular basis.
The procedure of this experiment was nearly identical to that of
experiment 3, except that the apple conditions were eliminated
and subjects only received one session rather than two, since
preferences in the previous experiments had been shown to be
constant over the course of two sessions. The test session consisted
of 12 trials, and food placement on each side was alternated and
counterbalanced between subjects for which food (raw or cooked)
appeared ﬁrst on which side. Beef was again used, and again cut
into 2 cm3 cubes then boiled for 10 min. Similar to experiments 2
and 3, pieces of plastic were placed on the table so as to not crosscontaminate the tastes of the raw and the cooked meat. In addition,
this experiment used the same criteria as experiment 3 to
determine participation in each trialdsubjects did not have to take
the ‘‘taste’’ piece offered on every trial, but simply had to take it on
the ﬁrst trial in order to be able to participate in the test.
Results
Results are shown in Table 5. Overall, subjects signiﬁcantly
preferred the cooked meat [one sample t-test, t(9) ¼ 5.589,
p < 0.001]. Six of the 10 subjects preferred the cooked meat
individually [binomial test, p < 0.05; in this instance, choosing
cooked on at least 10 of the 12 trials], and no subject signiﬁcantly
preferred the raw meat. Most subjects took the ‘‘taste’’ pieces on
nearly every trial, with only three individuals refusing the taste
piece more than once.
Discussion
These results demonstrated that even among a group of
chimpanzees that were not fed cooked meat on a regular basis,
individuals still showed a signiﬁcant preference for cooked over
raw beef. Thus, neophobia does not account for their preference,
nor can it entirely account for the preference of the Leipzig
chimpanzees seen in experiment 3.
General discussion
Overall, great apes in these experiments preferred cooked foods
to raw, from tubers to meat. However, they did not prefer all foods
cooked, being indifferent as to the choice between raw and cooked
apple and between raw and cooked white potato. Neophobia could
not be eliminated as a contributing factor in some results but, in
experiment 4, chimpanzees that were equally unfamiliar with
cooked and raw beef still preferred the cooked item. Subjects’
preferences remained stable across test sessions and across test

populations, suggesting that food choices were not strongly shaped
by past experience. The different properties being used to select the
cooked items were also strongly salient across individuals and
populations. This implies something inherently preferable about
the effects of cooking which is immediately discernable.
These results support the hypothesis that great apes perceive
and prefer properties of cooked food relative to raw, in the case of
both starchy foods and meat. It was unclear which properties apes
were sensitive to in the cooked food. The results of experiment 2
suggested that subjects may have used texture to discriminate
between the carrots of different manipulated consistencies. Yet
apes’ lack of preference for items such as cooked apple, which is
softer than raw apple, showed that other factors were involved as
well. It is important to note that in both cases where the cooked
item was not preferred over the raw (white potato and apple),
individuals did not prefer the raw item, but were simply indifferent
between the two options. This implies that apes may have chosen
the cooked item only when that item seemed signiﬁcantly better,
with the white potato and apple not showing large enough differences between cooked and raw to create a preference distinction.
Future work can investigate which properties of food items altered
by cooking are the most salient in determining preferences.
It is important to note that our experiments were not designed
to investigate what sort of preferences would have been found if
the apes had been given extended experience with the cooked
items, thus potentially using the postingestional consequences to
change their preferences. This has been examined in mammals,
including humans (Birch et al., 1990; Labouré et al., 2001;
Visalberghi et al., 2003). As such, one future area of research would
be to investigate whether nonhuman apes will also adapt their
preferences based on the digestive and nutritional consequences of
eating (e.g., caloric intake, etc.).
There were some species differences in the results. Past work
had demonstrated that taste thresholds for tannins and sugars
differ among great ape species (Laska, 2001; Remis and Kerr, 2002),
but many of the differences seen here may simply have been
a result of the chimpanzees being more neophobic than the other
apes. For example, the chimpanzees preferred the cooked meat to
the raw meat more strongly than the other species. However, in the
conditions where neophobia was not an issue, chimpanzees’
preferences resembled those of the other apes. This suggests that
great apes in general prefer the properties present in cooked food
rather than chimpanzees having any stronger of a preference.
Overall, our ﬁndings conform to evidence that wild chimpanzees
choose seeds that have been heated by wild ﬁres (Brewer, 1978),
demonstrating that great apes possess a preference for cooked
items. These preferences may be widespread in mammals, as shown
by the evidence for rats and cats preferring cooked items (Ramirez,
1992; Bradshaw et al., 2000), and as would be expected from the
improved quality of cooked items. Most likely, therefore, early
hominids prior to their control of ﬁre possessed these preferences as
well. This, in turn, suggests that cooking would have spread quickly
after it arose, with preferences for the properties of cooked food
being exapted from ancestral traits rather than having developed as
an adaptation to eating cooked food. If the former had been the case,
this would have suggested that cooking may not have spread until
human taste preferences could shift to select these foods. Thus, the
evidence that this preference is conserved over evolutionary history
supports the notion that early hominids were likely to have cooked
their food soon after possessing control of ﬁre, as they would have
readily preferred any items prepared by this method.
