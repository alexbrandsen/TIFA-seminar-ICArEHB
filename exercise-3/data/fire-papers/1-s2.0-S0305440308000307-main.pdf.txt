Abstract
A new calibration of human bones as a function of programmed temperature (200e1000  C) and time (0, 18 and 60 min) is presented and
discussed in order to investigate the issues related to the study of cremated bone remains by using the powder X-ray diffraction approach. The
experimental results confirm the growth of hydroxylapatite crystallites as a function of the applied temperature, with a sigmoid behaviour that
has been parameterized to the experimental data points. Particularly, it was observed that the thermal treatments for 60 min anticipate of about
100  C the effects that are otherwise observed after the treatments for 0 min. The developed procedure was subsequently applied to cremated
remains of various archaeological sites of Spain and supplied precise information not only about the temperature reached during the funerary
rites, but also on the presumed duration for the cremation.

1. Introduction
The study of cremated human remains is of considerable importance in anthropology and frequently coincides with issues
common to archaeology and forensics. For example it appears
particularly interesting to be able to assess the temperature
reached by civilizations using cremations within their funerary
practices and to estimate a possible time scale for the fire treatment of bodies. This also represents useful information concerning the fire and materials technology of the time.
In addition to this, an investigation of fire temperatures
seems advisable in order to confirm or reject the possibility
of occasional non-ritualistic fires in civilizations where the
use of funerary rites has never been verified in depth (Piga
et al., in press).

In a first instance, a visual investigation of the remains is able
to suggest whether the bones have been subjected to fire. However, these problems can be suitably and objectively addressed
with a powder X-ray diffraction approach for the hydroxylapatite
(HA) mineral phase, which is the main inorganic phase in bones.
Since 1975 (Bonucci and Graziani, 1975) it has been demonstrated that high temperatures of fire treatments induce
a growth of the average crystallite size of HA, which can be
appreciated relatively well from the line broadening/sharpening analysis of diffraction peaks.
In the first critical study of its kind, Shipman et al. (1984)
investigated the microscopic morphology of various osteological materials and used X-ray diffraction in order to assess
whether specimens of unknown taphonomic history were burnt
and the maximum temperature reached by those specimens.
These investigations are based on the fact that heating the
bones causes a sharpening of diffraction patterns, attributed
to increased crystallite size and decreased lattice strain of osteological phases.

However, subsequently Bartsiokas and Middleton (1992),
with the aim of characterizing and dating recent and fossil animal and human bones, suggested measuring a so-called crystallization index from their diffraction patterns, which can be
mainly ascribed to the presence of natural apatite phase. The
crystallization index, which is strictly related to the peak
sharpening effects, was actually defined as the intensity ratio
of (300)/(202) line profiles of hexagonal apatite, which normally occur as shoulder of the most intense (211) line in the
2q angular range from 31 to 35 when using Cu Ka radiation.
A linear correlation between crystallinity index and bone age
was reported over a period length of more than 106 years. It
should also be noted that another crystallinity index was almost concomitantly defined by Person et al. (1995) using
more peaks belonging to the same angular range.
It is clear that the two above mentioned lines of work may
be conflicting especially if the bones were subjected simultaneously to both physical effects of burning and annealing
across very long periods of time. This is further complicated
but the fact that there have been very few studies exploiting
this technique in 20 years since it’s first serious adoption.
Studies by Newesely (1988), Holden et al. (1995), Stiner
et al. (1995) and Rogers and Daniels (2002) have superficially
investigated this source of information, but lack the cohesive
nature necessary to allow one to overcome these sort of conflicts. However, in a sufficiently short period of time it seems
that the two effects can be assumed well distinct. As a matter
of fact, the time period investigated by Bartsiokas and Middleton requires some millions of years to observe significant
changes in the crystallization index, which is a quantity determined with an error bar of few percent. This means that the
crystallinity index may be regarded virtually unchanged in
a period in the order of 10,000 years, that is, in a period of archaeological and forensic relevance.
In order to further extend the validities of methodologies
which appeared in the literature we present here a calibration
protocol of a sample of bone as a function of selected temperatures of treatment in a range (200e1000  C), keeping also
into account the duration of burning (0, 18 and 60 min) thus
enabling a better simulation of a real firing process.
In particular, we analysed the behaviour of the bone sample
for some intermediate temperatures (650, 750, 775, 825 and
850  C) to closely investigate and describe the two-stage
growth regime of HA previously observed around 700  C
(Enzo et al., 2007).
Holden et al. (1995), Rogers and Daniels (2002) and recently Kalsbeek and Richter (2006) have also recorded key
crystalline changes within this temperature range. Within anthropology, this temperature range is significant because it is
during this transition that the size of the bone alters to a statistically significant degree (Shipman et al., 1984; Thompson,
2005). This in turn will not only impact on microstructural
studies of bone, but also on macroscopic analysis with
a view to determining a biological profile (sex determination,
age-at-death estimation, etc.) of the burned individual. The accuracy of such biological or osteological profiles is dependent
on the use of unmodified bone. This is true for both metric and

morphological anthropological techniques. Therefore it is essential that we understand the osseous changes during this
temperature range so that it is possible to create either new
techniques devised specifically for burned bone or new
methods of statistically correcting the output of current anthropological techniques when used on burned bone (Thompson,
2005). Furthermore, a more solid appreciation of these
changes will allow archaeologists to differentiate burned
bone from non-burned bone using XRD as has been attempted
so infrequently (Stiner et al., 1995).
The kinetics of crystallite growth is followed in relation to
the temperature and time duration in order to quickly and reliably evaluate the various aspects involved in the cremation
process. In fact, with this approach it will be possible to
make an accurate estimation of both temperature and likely
time duration of the cremation rite.
We have started our analysis from a dry ancient bone. Bohnert et al. (1998) observed that for total incineration of a body
via cremation about 2 h is necessary at a constant temperature
of 800  C, while for destruction of the fleshy parts about
50 min is believed to be needed. Thus, in view of a selected
temperature ramp with scanning rate of 20  C/min, our selected times appear to be coherent with a real cremation process. In spite of this we have directly checked our results by
treating fresh pig bones at some selected temperatures and
times of annealing.
Of course it is not guaranteed absolutely that the ramp heating process applied in the furnace laboratory is accurately reproducing a real fire even when the effects brought about the
specimens are perfectly compatible and identified. We also acknowledge that, in real-world circumstances, the consumption
and destruction of organic material may influence the top temperature of the heating process of bone inorganic phase but not
the consequent growth mechanism of crystallites.
Subsequently our calibration is applied to some cremated human bones coming from various archaeological Spanish sites
belonging to different historical ages, where we have investigated the powder patterns and, from the measured average crystallite size, temperature and time of treatment are estimated.
2. Materials
For the kinetics study of the bone subjected to selected temperatures and times we have used 34 human femoral fragments
collected in the Giant Tomb ‘‘La Testa’’ (Santa Teresa di Gallura, Sassari), belonging to the Nuragic era (Tedde et al.,
1994). In order to verify the occurrence of a different behaviour
with respect to ancient dry human bones some pieces of fleshy
pig bones were also treated according to the present protocol.
The calibration was applied to cremated remains from
Spain, details of which are given in Table 1.
3. Methods
The samples used for calibration were heat-treated with
a heating rate of 20  C/min at selected temperatures (200e
1000  C for 0, 18 and 60 min) in air using a NEY muffle

4. Results and discussion
In Fig. 1 we report a comparison of the X-ray diffraction
intensity of untreated ancient human bone, untreated recent
human bone recovered from the grave yard ossuary of Sassari
which is not more than 50 years old, and untreated pig bone
here studied as a function of the scattering angle 2q in the
range 15e120 . Experiments are data points, full curve is
the Rietveld fit calculated according to the contribution of
the structure factors of hydroxylapatite (monoclinic, space
group P21/c, refined lattice parameters a ¼ 9.440,
b ¼ 18.898, c ¼ 6.896 Å and b ¼ 120.67 ) and calcite

(trigonal, R-3c, a ¼ 4.988, c ¼ 17.070 Å). As is usual in the
present Rietveld approach, the curve difference between calculated and experimental data points is shown at the bottom,
while the sequence of bars indicates the expected peak positions for each phase. From the proposed comparison it
emerges that there is no sensible difference in the structure
factors of human and animal bones here examined, whether
they are fresh or dry and ancient. This may represent a strong
point in order to use XRD as a probe for the possible burning
of bones, whatever the animal or human origin.
The quantitative Rietveld analysis points to the fact that hydroxylapatite is the main phase for bones. The structure of hydroxylapatite is also reported hexagonal, space group P63/
mmc but the monoclinic structure factor was preferred since
it gave systematically better agreement factors dealing with
our pattern collection. The peak profiles of hydroxylapatite
are very broad on account of the nanocrystalline condition
of materials with very small average crystallite size and/or
large lattice disorder. The average coherent diffraction domain

furnace. The specimens for X-ray investigations were powdered by manual grinding in an agate mortar.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded
overnight using Bruker D8, Philips PW-1050, Siemens D500, Rigaku D/MAX diffractometers in the BraggeBrentano
geometry with Cu Ka radiation (l ¼ 1.54178 Å). The goniometer was equipped with a graphite monochromator in the
diffracted beam and the patterns were collected with 0.05
of step size. The X-ray generator worked at a power of
40 kV and 30 mA and the resolution of the instruments (divergent and antiscatter slits of 0.5 ) was determined using a-SiO2
and a-Al2O3 standards free from the effect of reduced crystallite size and lattice defects. The powder patterns were collected in the angular range 15e120 in 2q and were
analyzed according to the Rietveld (1967) method, using the
programme MAUD (Lutterotti et al., 1998). This is an efficient
approach that evaluates quantitatively the amount, structure
and microstructural parameters of mineralogical phases keeping into account also the instrumental parameters. This is
a necessary pre-requisite in order to correctly distinguish
from the peak broadening the average crystallite size from
the lattice disorder. The method may replace previous
approaches that were adopted to study the bones based on
an arbitrarily defined ‘‘index of crystallinity’’.
Thermo-gravimetry and differential thermal analyses (TGe
DTA) were conducted using a Setaram instrument from room
temperature up to 1500  C at a heating rate of 20  C/min in air.
After reaching the final temperature, the specimens were immediately allowed to cool down.

did not show any sharp weight loss around 800  C. On the
other hand, the bone here studied may be regarded unconventional because ancient. In fact in Fig. 2B we report the TGe
DTA curves of a recent human bone.
It can be seen that in this case there is not significant evidence of CO2 evolution around 800  C. Also, the weight
loss is higher in percentage probably due to the larger fraction
of collagen in the recent bone. This is also confirmed by the
exothermal wide peak located around 350  C.
We report in Fig. 3 a selected portion of patterns from 30 to
39 in 2q referred to the specimens heated up to the temperatures of 700, 775, 800, 825, 850, 900 and 1000  C, respectively, which show the disappearance of calcite and the
simultaneous appearance of calcium oxide as argued from
the thermogram previously reported in Fig. 2. As it can be
seen, the peak of calcium oxide occurring at 2q ¼ 37.5 starts
to appear at 775  C, becomes evident at 800  C and increases
with the temperature until 1000  C, this phase reaching its
maximum amount. Line broadening analysis as a function of
temperature and residence time for the hydroxylapatite phase
allows to observe a clear evolution due to an average crystallite size increase which has been separated from the lattice
strain. As it concerns the values for the lattice strain, these
are better determined from the peak broadening at high angles
(>80 in 2q) where unfortunately the intensity is very weak.
This fact required a suitably long data collection strategy. It
should be clear that these problems all together represent a further limitation for precise determination of the heat-treatment
in unknown bones using comparative analyses.
This so determined average crystallite sizes of the HA mineral phase are collected in Table 2 and given in Å units.
For temperatures from 200  C to around 650  C no significant growth appears to be induced. Also, the residence time of
18 and 60 min at these temperatures is not changing dramatically the microstructure, with only slight effects of grain
growth, on account of a relative stability of the system.
It is not so from 700  C (60 min) and higher temperatures,
where an effect of sudden growth appears evident and further
distinguishable in the temperature range 750e850  C, where
three different growth processes can be evaluated.

the Rietveld approach is in the range between 168 and 177 Å.
Note that, apart from root mean square deviation problems,
this result may be different from the figure normally obtained
applying the Scherrer (1918) equation on the most intense
peak. The value may also be distinct from the average particle
size that can be evaluated using SAXS data, since the latter
may refer to a collection of agglomerated crystallites (Guinier,
1963; Hiller et al., 2003; Thompson, 2005).
Further, it should be kept in mind that average values from
transmission electron microscopy observations refer to a surface weighted mean (Matyi et al., 1987).
A weak component of calcite (ca. 3.0 wt%) was also identified in the pattern. The presence of calcite is to be expected
in bones but this is not a rule. According to Wopenka and Pasteris (2005), the maximum amount of endogenous calcite in
human bones may not exceed 7e8 wt%, as estimated from
3
CO2
3 groups that can substitute for PO4 in the hydroxylapatite structure.
Fig. 2A shows the thermogravimetric (TG) and differential
thermal analysis (DTA) curves of the ancient sample bone
here studied as a function of the temperature. The TG curve
shows a moderate weight loss of about 5% before 400  C with
a broad exothermic peak which can be due to dehydroxylation.
This observation is in qualitative fair agreement with recent
TGeDTA curves reported by Odriozola and Martı̀nez-Blanes
(2007), where a larger weight loss of an apatite bone was reported. Also, in our curve a sharp weight loss occurs above the
temperature of 800  C, which can be assigned to the loss of carbon dioxide from calcite according to the chemical reaction:
CaCO3 2 CaO þ CO2 :
The endothermic peak at the correspondent temperature is
a further confirmation for this reaction (see also the XRD pattern analysis reported later). Further heating to 1500  C does
not affect substantially the state of the bone in terms of transformation phenomena and/or weight loss. This interpretation
may be in contrast with the work by Wang et al. (2004) and
Odriozola and Martı̀nez-Blanes (2007), but is supported by
Kalsbeek and Richter (2006). Note that, the trace of another
ancient bone recently published by us (Enzo et al., 2007)

In fact an upper limit of 1500 Å for the size determination
is generally associated to this technique, depending from the
collimation arrangement adopted.
We may also note that the residence time of 60 min evidences an effect of crystallite growth that would be obtained
at temperatures 100  C higher without any residence time.
This allows to establish a confidence degree for the applicability of the present experimental approach.
Objections may be raised about the use of archaeological
remains for this calibration, since the real fire was conducted
on bodies. For this reason we have performed a partial comparative test by using fleshy pig bones.
In Fig. 4 we present the XRD patterns of fresh pig bones as
a function of some selected temperatures and residence times.
Table 3 reports the average crystallite size deduced according
to our Rietveld approach, which demonstrates a behaviour of
the crystallite growth as a function of temperature very close
to that observed for ancient dry bones.
It may be concluded that the destruction by fire of organic
parts affects only slightly the heating process but does change
significantly the growth process of HA crystallites as a function
of the temperature.

For specimens treated at temperatures higher than 850  C
and for long residence times the determination of the average
crystallite size may be of difficult reproducibility because of
the instrument contribution. This problem was similarly experienced by Hiller et al. (2003).

The data compare very closely with analogue treatments carried out on human
ancient bones.

The markedly different behaviour for the specimens treated
above 650  C is clearly seen also in Fig. 5, where symbols refer to the measured crystallite size values as a function of temperature treatment. Restricting our attention to the specimens
heated without any residence time, we can appreciate even
with the logarithmic scale the rather sudden increase of the
average crystallite size for temperatures around 750  C, in
agreement with previous XRD observations.
The growth process seems to proceed up to 1000  C in
keeping with a sigmoidal growth-type law typical of most of
the reactions in the solid state.

the logistic curves and p is a parameter for the rate growth,
likely dependent from scanning rate, temperature and residence time.
Note that for the series at time residence of 0 min the
growth phenomenon is particularly sharp in the range 750e
900  C, while for the other two curves the growth kinetics appears to occur in a more extended range from 600 to 1000  C
where the relevant p values are quite close.
5. Study of Spanish burnt bones collection
The patterns of 11 Spanish burned bones here presented are
reported in Fig. 6. All specimens except for MB1-E378-96
show the dominant presence of HA with traces of calcite. Conversely, sample MB1-E378-96 is made up by phases typical of
ash that is calcite, quartz and muscovite with only a fraction
30.0 wt% of HA. For some specimens the calcite amounts to
ca. 19.0 wt%, suggesting a likely exogenous origin for this
mineral (for example from the contact with ground of
limestone).
For all samples except for IP-B13 we may notice in the patterns a considerable peak sharpening, due to marked crystallite
growth and lattice strain reduction which is induced by the occurred thermal treatment. These features can be appreciated in
Fig. 7 where the patterns are reported in the ‘‘conventional’’
angular range 30e39 in 2q.
Concerning the average crystallite size values and lattice
strain, the 11 investigated specimens have supplied the results
collected in Table 5.
As it is surmised all the remains were subjected to fire treatment at very high temperature (750e1000  C) except for specimens IP-B13 which turns out to be burned at lower
temperatures (<500  C).
The calculated high temperature values clearly show as in
early ages the fire technology in Spain was considerably effective and developed for crematory practices.
6. Conclusions
A new and detailed protocol to estimate the temperature
and possible duration of a funerary cremation rite was developed in the temperature range 200e1000  C for various residence times (0, 18 and 60 min) using the X-ray powder
diffraction technique.

Fig. 6. The experimental patterns (data points) and Rietveld fit (full lines) of bones from Spanish sites here investigated. Note the significant peak sharpening in all
samples except for IPB-13, which testify for the fire technology in use in Spain in ancient times.

The growth process undergone by the crystallites of the
mineralogical phase hydroxylapatite follows a sigmoid trend
of logistic type with a characteristic temperature around
850  C, as it was determined for the three times investigated.
In the thermal treatment for 0 min the growth rate seems to be
higher than for curves at subsequent times.

Thermal treatments for 60 min anticipate of about 100  C
the effects that are otherwise observed after the treatments
for 0 min.
Based on these calibration curves, 11 cremated Spanish
bones were investigated. It was established that they were
subjected to fire treatment at high temperatures in the range

750e1000  C, except for sample IP-B13 that turned out to be
burned at lower temperatures (<500  C). For nine samples the
cremation times were evaluated shorter than 1 h but for two of
them the duration was longer.
The high temperatures determined in the examined specimens clearly demonstrate that in various ancient ages of Spain
to which samples are referring, the fire technology was well
developed and quite efficient even in funerary cremation rites.
