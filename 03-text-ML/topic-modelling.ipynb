    "# Topic Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll do some topic modelling on a selection of 144 papers about the use of fire in the paleolithic in Europe. We'll try to see if there are clusters of papers that have a similar topic, to see if there's any running themes in this research field. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you might expect from the word 'clusters', topic modelling is a unsupervised learning method, so we don't have any labels for the texts, just the texts themselves. A topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract \"topics\" that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. Intuitively, given that a document is about a particular topic, one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently: \"pyramid\" and \"pharaoh\" will appear more often in documents about Egyptian archaeology, \"Stonehenge\" and \"Beaker Culture\" will appear in documents about British archaeology, and \"the\" and \"is\" will appear approximately equally in both.\n",
    "\n",
