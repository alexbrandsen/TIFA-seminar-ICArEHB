EVIDENCE OF EARLY PALEOINDIAN BONE MODIFICATION AND

USE AT THE SHERIDEN CAVE SITE (33WY252), WYANDOT COUNTY,
OHIO

Brian G. Redmond and Kenneth B. Tankersley

The analysis of osseous (bone, antler, or ivory) beveled shafts or "rods" has become an important focus in the study of early

Paleoindian tool technology. Since 1995 two carved and beveled bone rods have been recovered from Sheriden Cave i
northwest Ohio in depositional strata that are radiocarbon dated to between 11,060 and 10,400 radiocarbon years B.P
These strata also contained a small, reworked, Gainey- style fluted point; cut and burned animal bone; and the remains of

flat-headed peccary, caribou, giant beaver, and other taxa. The tapered tips and overall morphology of the bone rods demon-

strate that they served as projectile points as opposed to other functional types such as foreshafts. Microscopic and radiographic examinations of the bone points reveal that they were manufactured from split sections of mega-mammal bone.

These artifacts resemble bone and ivory points found at early Paleoindian sites in western North America and norther
Florida but also bear significant morphological similarities to bone sagaie or javelin tips known from Upper Paleolithi

sites in Europe. The close spatial and temporal associations between the Sheriden Cave artifacts suggest that they repre
sent the remains of an early Paleoindian tool cache within a small resource extraction campsite.

La recuperacion y andlisis de cahas o "varillas" biseladas hechas de materiales oseos (hueso, cornamenta o marfil) ya con

stituten un enfoque importante del estudio de la tecnologia del herramitas del Paleoindio Temprano. Desde 1995, se han recu-

perado un total de dos varillas de hueso tallado y biselado de las capas que datan al Pleistoceno Tardio en la cueva Sheride
Cave, del noroeste de Ohio (EE.UU.). Los artefactos de hueso se recuperaron de estratos que datan entre 11,060 y 10,400
anos 14C a. P. Estos estratos contenian tambien una pequena y retocada punta acanalada de estilo Gainey, huesos de anim

modificados culturalmente (cortados o quemados) y los restos desarticulados de jabali (Platygonus compressus), caribu
(Rangifer tarandus), castor gigante (Castoroides ohioensis) y otras taxas. Tanto la terminacidn conica como la morfolog

total de las varillas de hueso demuestran que Servian depuntas de proyectil, es decir, que no formaban parte de la caha misma

Estudios microscopicos y radiogrdficos de laspuntas de hueso indican que fueronfabricados de secciones de hueso quebrado

de mega-mamifero, posiblemente derivados de bisonte, buey almizclero, perezozo terrestre, mamut o mastodonte. En general

estos artefactos separecen a laspuntas de hueso y marfil que se encuentran en los sitios Paleoindios del oeste de Norte Americ

y de Florida septentrional; pero tambien comparten bastantes similitudes morfologicas con una clase de sagaie, o puntas de
jabalina, de hueso y cornamenta que se conocen de sitios europeos del Paleolitico Superior. Al mismo tiempo, su morfologia

indica que laspuntas de hueso de Sheriden Cave podrian derivarse de varillas mas largas y doble biselados o de lanzas unibise-

ladas. Por ultimo, las estrechas asociaciones espaciales y temporales entre las puntas de hueso de Sheriden Cave, las punta

acanaladas y posiblemente el raspador de lasca grande tambien recuperado alia, sugieren que estos artefactos representa
los restos de un contexto de herramientas del periodo Paleoindio Temprano depositadas en un pequeno campamento, instalado para la extraccion de recursos.
