Opaline phytoliths are important microfossils used in archaeological and ecological research. Relatively
little is known about the stability of phytoliths after burial. Under alkaline pH conditions they can
dissolve, and mechanical disturbances can cause a loss of their more delicate appendages. Here we
present an experimental study of phytolith stability (combination of solubility and abrasion). Modern
and fossil phytoliths were extracted from wheat using new methods to minimize dissolution, and by
burning in an oven. These assemblages were placed in a solution buffered to pH 10 and maintained under
constant temperature and shaking conditions. The silicon concentrations in the solution were monitored
once a week for 5 weeks. The phytolith morphologies in each assemblage were determined at the outset
of the experiment and after 5 weeks. The results show that there are differences in stability between
various assemblages. Modern inﬂorescence wheat phytolith assemblages are more unstable than those
from leaves/stems. Burnt assemblages are less stable than unburnt assemblages, and a fossil phytolith
assemblage about 3000 years old is more stable than the modern wheat assemblages. The results also
show that individual phytolith morphotypes have different stabilities, and as a result of dissolution and
abrasion, some morphotypes may resemble others. This study further shows that archaeological and/or
paleo-environmental interpretation of phytolith assemblages may change with the assemblage’s state of
preservation.

1. Introduction
Opaline phytoliths are a major component of the microscopic
archaeological record in many archaeological sites. The fact that
they are composed of opal (silica) makes them a relatively durable
component of sedimentary deposits. They are therefore widely
used to obtain invaluable information on the archaeobotanical
record (Piperno, 2006; Weiner, 2010). Phytoliths can, however, be
lost from the archaeological and geological records due to a variety
of different processes. Phytoliths may be directly dissolved by the
roots of living plants (Alexandre et al., 1997; Farmer et al., 2005;
Gérard et al., 2008). Phytoliths may totally or partially dissolve
under alkaline conditions that are present in many archaeological
sites and in geological sediments (Karkanas, 2010; Piperno, 1988,
2006). The delicate appendages of phytoliths may be lost due to
mechanical abrasion, and partially dissolved phytoliths will more
easily break into fragments due to bioturbation or transport

(Osterrieth et al., 2009). Such taphonomic and diagenetic changes
can result in misinterpretation of poorly preserved phytolith
assemblages.
It is well established that the concentrations of phytoliths in
soils are relatively low, compared to their concentrations in many
archaeological sites (Albert et al., 2000; Cabanes et al., 2010;
Shahack-Gross et al., 2003; Tsartsidou et al., 2008, 2009). This is
probably in part due directly or indirectly to human activities at the
site that result in accumulations of large amounts of organic matter
together with their associated phytoliths (Albert et al., 2008), and
possibly due to the fact that fewer plants grow on site while it is
inhabited and hence dissolution of phytoliths due to their root
activities is less. Phytoliths present in sediments in an archaeological site are also subject to diagenetic changes and losses. The
challenge is to understand these processes and identify parameters
that can indicate whether a fossil phytolith assemblage is or is not
well preserved. Here we address the general problem of phytolith
stability by carrying out laboratory experiments on modern and
fossil phytolith assemblages.
Studies of biogenic opal from diatoms and phytoliths show
that they are most insoluble around pH 3 and that their solubility

D. Cabanes et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 38 (2011) 2480e2490

increases signiﬁcantly under alkaline conditions (Fraysse et al.,
2006a, 2006b, 2009; Loucaides et al., 2008, 2010, and references
therein). As many archaeological sites contain, or once did contain
calcitic wood ash as well as other sources of calcium carbonate,
the pH of the water in their sediments would be buffered to
around 8. At this pH regime phytoliths do dissolve, albeit rather
slowly. Fraysse et al. (2009) demonstrated that the rate of phytolith dissolution in different samples of plants is similar. Nevertheless, previous experiments comparing phytoliths from
different plant origin (deciduous leaves, grass and conifer phytoliths) shown signiﬁcant stability differences between them
(Bartoli and Wilding, 1980; Wilding and Drees, 1974). This
however does not exclude the possibility that different phytolith
morphotypes within the same plant may dissolve at different
rates. A key observation in this direction was made by Albert et al.
(2006) who reported that the soil phytolith assemblage under
a certain vegetation type was signiﬁcantly different from the plant
phytolith assemblage from which the soil phytoliths are derived.
This could be due to some morphotypes being absent in the
sediments because they are less stable than other morphotypes,
as has been noted previously (Alexandre et al., 1997; Carnelli
et al., 2002). This is a serious concern for phytolith research in
archaeology and ecology, as the archaeological and paleoecological interpretations of phytolith assemblages are essentially based
on the relative abundances of the various phytolith morphotypes
(Piperno, 1988).
In this study we show that different phytolith assemblages from
wheat, as well as different phytolith morphotypes from wheat, do
have different stabilities under alkaline conditions, and we assess
how differential dissolution and hence stability may affect the
interpretation of the phytolith-based archaeobotanical record.

2. Materials and methods
We addressed several methodological problems. First, phytoliths had to be extracted from modern plants, as well as archaeological sediments without, if possible, altering the solubility of
the opal during the extraction procedure. Common laboratory
methods for extracting phytoliths from plants and sediments use
strong acids or are based on the incineration of the plant (Jenkins,
2009; Katz et al., 2010; Lentfer and Boyd, 1998; Madella et al.,
1998; Parr, 2002; Parr et al., 2001). Strong acids may completely
dissolve phytoliths. Katz et al. (2010) reported that phytoliths in
dilute HCl dissolved in a matter of days. Heating may affect
phytolith solubility as phytoliths incorporate heavy metals from
their immediate microenvironment during the incineration
process, and this changes their surface chemical composition
(Jones and Milne, 1963). Heating the phytoliths may also alter
their solubility, as it is known that heating alters the refractive
index, which in turn reﬂects a change in the water and hydroxyl
contents of the silica (Elbaum et al., 2003). We therefore developed two different methods that avoided exposure to extreme pH
and high temperature conditions; one for extraction of modern
phytoliths from plant material (Section 2.1 below) and one for
extraction of fossil phytoliths from archaeological sediments
(Section 2.2 below). Using both methods, we were able to recover
sufﬁcient quantities of pure phytoliths that could be used for the
experiments (Section 2.3 below). Note that these extraction
methods are not designed to extract all the phytoliths from the
plant or sediment and therefore they should not be used for
conventional phytolith analyses of plants and sediments. The
major purpose of this extraction procedure was to obtain as pure
a sample as possible without changing the chemical and physical
properties of the opal forming phytoliths.

2.1. Modern phytolith extraction
Modern phytoliths were extracted from mature dry wheat (Triticum aestivum) collected in the western Galilee, Northern Israel. The
inﬂorescence of each plant was manually separated from the leaves
and stems, and then washed with distilled water and placed into
a sonicator bath (Cole-Parmer 8891) in order to remove mineral
contamination attached to the plant surface. Once cleaned, about
50 g of the plant material was blended with approximately 500 ml of
ethanol using a laboratory blender (Waring Commercial Laboratory
Blender) until there was no observable change in the consistency of
the suspension. The planteethanol mixture was then ﬁltered
through 1 mm2 openings using cotton gauze. The ﬁltered mixture
containing phytoliths and plant fragments smaller than 1 mm2 was
then transferred to 50 ml Falcon tubes which were centrifuged at
3000 rpm for 5 min (Eppendorf centrifuge 5702). The supernatant
was removed and the pellet was air-dried and weighed.
To eliminate the organic material from the pellets a solution of
30% H2O2 in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 buffer adjusted to pH 6.0 was prepared.
Forty ml of the buffered peroxide solution were added to each
pellet in 50 ml Falcon tubes and heated in a water bath between 70
and 80  C for 2 h. The remaining peroxide was removed by
centrifugation (3000 rpm for 5 min) followed by washing with
distilled water and centrifugation as above, to eliminate any
remaining peroxide.
The quality of the sample was examined using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. About 0.1 mg of sample was
mixed with 80 mg of KBr to produce a pellet using a hydraulic press.
FTIR spectra were collected at 4 cm1 resolution using a Nicolet 380
FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation). Once optimally
puriﬁed, as indicated by the FTIR analyses, the different pellets
were pooled in an agate mortar and gently homogenized.
The plant material that did not pass through the gauze ﬁlter was
used for preparation of a modern burnt phytolith sample. This
material was dried at 50  C for 24 h and then dry ashed in a mufﬂe
furnace at 500  C for 5 h. The burnt material was analyzed with FTIR
and its spectrum indicated that it was composed of pure opal.
Note that the original phytolith assemblage in the two modern
samples e the fresh extracted sample and the burnt sample e is not
the same as the initial plant matter used for their preparation was
different. This is the result of the blending and ﬁltering of the plant
material which produces a differential separation of some phytolith
morphotypes. Using this method, the following modern plant
materials were prepared: unburnt leaves/stems, burnt leaves/stems,
unburnt inﬂorescence, burnt inﬂorescence (duplicated).
2.2. Fossil phytolith extraction
Phytoliths were obtained from a previously studied Iron Age (ca.
1000e900 BC) phytolith-rich layer from Tel Dor (L06D5-014)
(Albert et al., 2008), a coastal mound site in northern Israel. This
archaeological sediment is light-grey and is composed primarily of
opal, quartz, calcite and clay, based on its infrared spectrum. The
sample was gently homogenized using an agate mortar and pestle.
About 0.5 g of the initial dry sediment was placed on Econopac
columns (Bio-Rad) with a 30 micron polyethylene ﬁlter inside.
Distilled water adjusted to pH 5 was allowed to drip continuously
through the column. The pH of the water was monitored with a pH
meter (pHM250 Meterlab, Radiometer Analytical) once in 24 h and
adjusted back to pH 5 if necessary. An aliquot of the sediment was
sampled every 24 h, dried, and analyzed using FTIR to monitor for
the presence of carbonates. The monitoring results indicated that
after 48 h most carbonates in the sediment were dissolved. The
almost totally decalciﬁed sample was then transferred to a 15 ml
Falcon tube. The tube was ﬁlled with distilled water and

2482

centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded
and the tube was ﬁlled again with distilled water and the pellet was
re-suspended. This operation was repeated three times. The pellet
was transferred to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and sonicated (W-380
sonicator, Heatsystem ultrasonic) for 5 min to disaggregate the
remaining mineral particles. The sediment was then transferred to
a 15 ml Falcon tube ﬁlled with 10 ml of distilled water. This tube
was vortexed in order to homogenize and suspend the small
sediment particles in the water. The content of this tube was
transferred with a 10 ml automatic pipette (Powerpette plus, Jencons) to the top of a glass burette (50 cm in height, 500 ml in
volume) previously ﬁlled with double distilled water. Turbulence
due to the addition of the suspended sediment sample was reduced
as much as possible by using the automatic pipette. Once the
sample was added at the top of the column, 15 ml fractions of water
and suspended particles were collected every 2 min by opening the
stopper at the bottom of the column. Two drops of the suspension
from each fraction were placed on a microscope slide, covered by
a cover glass, and observed using a petrographic microscope at
200 (Nikon Eclipse E600 pol). This examination took place at the
same time as the fraction collection was proceeding. Fraction
collection stopped when clay particles became abundant as
observed using the petrographic microscope. The ﬁrst fractions
containing mostly quartz were discarded. The fractions containing
abundant phytoliths were then pooled and placed at the top of
a freshly ﬁlled column, and the procedure was repeated once more.
At this point, some clay particles were still present, but all quartz
was effectively removed based on the petrographic observation. In
order to eliminate the remaining clay, the non-discarded fractions
from the second column were sonicated for 2 min and centrifuged
at 1000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant containing the remaining
clay particles was discarded and the process was repeated 3 or 4
times until the supernatant was clear, based on microscope
examination. The pure sample was dried at 50  C in an oven and
weighed. Using this procedure we obtained around 41 mg of pure
phytolith sample from 0.6 g of the original archaeological
phytolith-rich sediment sample (equivalent to 6.8% of the initial
weight). This procedure was repeated until we obtained enough
sample for the dissolution experiments (more than 200 mg). A
sample of burnt fossil phytoliths was prepared by burning an
aliquot from the puriﬁed fossil sample at 500  C for 5 h.
2.3. Dissolution experiments
An aqueous solution buffered to pH 10 using 0.1 M Trizma Base
(Sigma) buffer and 0.1 M NaCl, was prepared. The pH of the solution
was adjusted using 1 M HCl. Although pH 10 is uncommon in
archaeological sediments and soils, we used this pH range to
increase phytolith dissolution in a convenient period of time. Fortyﬁve ml of this solution were transferred into seven 50 ml Falcon
tubes. A weighed aliquot (around 50 mg) of the various pure phytolith samples was then placed in each tube (Table 1). The use of

glass containers was avoided since these could contaminate the
solution with silicon (Si). Note that one sample was repeated twice
(experiments 4 and 5, Table 1). Two control samples were added to
the experiments; one blank (i.e., the buffer solution without any
added silicate material) and one in which synthetic silica (used for
chromatography, 70e230 mesh, Merck) dissolved in water was
added to the buffer solution (Table 1). The blank control was used to
detect possible external/internal contamination. The dissolved
silica control was used to monitor whether the silicon concentration remained constant throughout the experiment.
The tubes were sealed with Paraﬁlm and placed horizontally in
an Innova 4430 shaker-incubator set at 50  C and 70 rpm for 5
weeks. Once a week the incubator was stopped, the tubes vortexed
and 1 ml of solution (including suspended phytoliths) was extracted from each tube, placed in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to
a clean tube and stored for silicon content determination, while the
pellet, which contained phytoliths, was washed three times with
distilled water and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The clean
pellet was dried in an oven at 50  C, weighed and stored for future
analyses. The experiments were stopped at the end of the 5th week.
The remaining phytoliths and solutions were separated and stored
using the same procedure as above.
Phytolith dissolution was monitored by measuring the silicon
concentration [Si] in the solution every week. This was done
using the molybdate blue method (Fishman and Friedman, 1989)
with an Ocean Optics USBeISSeUV/VIS spectrophotometer. The
accuracy of measurements is 0.05 mM. Measurements were
made following dilution (100 ml of the extract in 900 ml of distilled
water) in order to adjust the solution concentration to the range
of the instrument. Three different measurements were carried out
on each supernatant extract in order to evaluate the precision of
the measurements. The mineral component was monitored before
and after the dissolution by infrared spectrometry as described
above (Section 2.1).
Phytolith counting and morphotypes identiﬁcation was carried
out before and after dissolution using a petrographic microscope
(Nikon Eclipse 50iPol) at 200 and 400. About 1 mg of phytolith
residue at the beginning and end of each experiment was mounted
on microscope slides using Entellan New (Merck). Three different
slides were prepared from the initial residue (i.e., before dissolution) and three different slides from the ﬁnal residue (i.e., after
dissolution), from each experiment (except for experiment 5, i.e.,
a total of 39 slides). At least 250 phytoliths were counted in each
slide. Phytolith identiﬁcation was carried out using the standard
literature (Twiss et al., 1969; Piperno, 1988, 2006; Mulholland and
George Rapp, 1992). The International Code for Phytolith Nomenclature was also followed where possible (Madella et al., 2005).
Note that the extraction methods may cause some damage to
the phytoliths. As we however compare the same assemblage
before and after dissolution/abrasion, the extraction method does
not inﬂuence our results.

3. Results
3.1. Apparent solubilities of phytolith assemblages
Phytolith assemblages from modern wheat plants and fossil
sediments approximately 3000 years old were placed in an alkaline
solution buffered to pH 10. Dissolution was monitored by
measuring the silicon concentration [Si] in the solution. Fig. 1
shows the weekly concentration of Si in each sample. The blank
control did not have any measurable silicon, as expected. The dissolved silicon control remained constant during the 5 weeks of the
experiment, indicating that samples were not contaminated and
silicon was not lost by adsorption or precipitation. Fig. 1 shows that
the Si concentrations of the modern samples all reached a steady
state within one week, the burnt fossil sample took 2 weeks to
reach a steady state and the unburnt fossil sample appears not to
have reached a steady state even after 5 weeks. The silicon
concentrations of the steady states reached by each sample are
different, implying that the apparent solubilities of the opal of each
assemblage are different. Fig. 1 shows that fresh phytoliths are
more soluble than fossil phytoliths as they released more Si into the
solution. Furthermore, a comparison of the unburnt and burnt fresh
and fossil samples all show that heating to 500  C (“burning”)
results in the phytoliths becoming more soluble. In addition, phytoliths from the unburnt inﬂorescence of the wheat plant are
slightly more soluble than those from the unburnt leaves and
stems, while after burning there appears to be no difference in the
solubilities between burnt inﬂorescences and burnt leaves/stems.
The amount of material dissolved was monitored by weighing
the samples before and after each experiment. Fig. 2 shows the
percent weight loss as a function of Si concentration at the end of

2483

the experiments. The results are, with one exception, consistent
with the steady state Si concentrations observed in the experimental solutions (Fig. 1). The one exception is the burnt inﬂorescence sample which lost around 35% of its weight after dissolution,
but the silicon concentration in the solution after one week was
similar to the burnt fresh leaf/stem sample. The experiment was
repeated in order to conﬁrm this result (Fig. 2).
3.2. Changes in the mineral component
No major changes in the FTIR spectra were observed before and
after the dissolution experiment. We did however observe a small
decrease of the 950 cm1 absorption shoulder in the modern
unburnt samples after dissolution (Fig. 3), indicating loss of
hydroxyl (silanol) groups (SiOH; Loucaides et al., 2010) and possibly
bound water molecules following dissolution. We also noted that
this absorption band was absent in the samples that were burnt
(Fig. 3). Note that the modern samples shown here are not
composed of pure opal but include bands that indicate the presence
of carbonates and phosphates.
3.3. Changes in phytolith morphotypes
Wheat produces many different phytolith morphotypes. A
major aim of this study was to determine whether certain morphotypes are more stable than others. In these experiments
stability refers both to the solubility of the opal with more soluble
opal resulting in less stable phytoliths, and to mechanical stability.
As the samples were kept in constant motion, the thinner and
hence more fragile phytoliths could break up into unidentiﬁable
fragments compared to the more robust phytoliths. This

mechanical break down would be enhanced for phytolith morphotypes that dissolve more rapidly. Figs. 4e6 present the observed
changes before and after dissolution in alkaline pH of the most
abundant (>2%) phytolith morphotypes in the extracted phytolith
assemblages. The results are presented in two ways: as numbers of
phytoliths in 1 mg of sample (after normalization relative to the
initial number of phytoliths) and as the relative abundance of
phytolith morphotypes in the whole assemblage (i.e., percentage of
the total identiﬁable phytoliths). The most abundant morphotypes
account for more than 90% of each sample. The so-called “weathered morphotype” refers to phytoliths that have an irregular shape
and a pitted surface. They may be derived from different sources
and as the name implies, are generally thought to be the result of

weathering. Note that only the initial and ﬁnal assemblages can be
compared directly, but not the unburnt (Fig. 4) and burnt (Fig. 5)
modern assemblages as these were produced from different sources (see Section 2.1).
In the unburnt leaves/stem sample (Fig. 4a) 8 of the 9 abundant
morphotypes show a reduction in phytolith numbers per mg after
dissolution, whereas the difference for the weathered morphotype
is not signiﬁcant. Surprisingly, weathered morphotypes are present
in signiﬁcant amounts in the initial sample, clearly showing that
they are not only a product of weathering. In terms of relative
abundance (%), the rondel short cell (S.C.) and the bulliforms
become more abundant after dissolution, the parallelepipedal (P.)
elongate rugulates stay the same, whereas the P. elongate psilates
in particular become less abundant. Even though all these changes
are relative, it is quite clear that some morphotypes are less stable
(e.g., the P. elongate psilates) than others (e.g., the rondels and the
bulliforms). In the unburnt inﬂorescence sample (Fig. 4b) the
P. elongate rugulates and the weathered morphotypes maintain
the same phytolith numbers per mg, and increase in relative
abundance.
In the burnt leaves/stem sample (Fig. 5a) again all the morphotypes except for the P. elongate rugulates decrease in numbers
per mg, and there is a major reduction in the percentage of sinuous
long cell (L.C.) morphotypes while an increase in the percentage of
the P. elongate rugulates. In the burnt inﬂorescence sample (Fig. 5b)

the differences in phytolith numbers per mg between initial and
ﬁnal samples are generally small, with the P. elongate rugulate
morphotype showing an increase in both numbers and percentage.
This implies that even though around 35 weight% of the sample was
lost, the different morphotypes dissolve rather uniformly.
The results of the changes in the modern morphotype assemblages clearly show that the same morphotypes from leaves/stems
and inﬂorescence can behave differently, and that there is something unusual about the P. elongate rugulate morphotype.
The effect of dissolution on the fossil unburnt and burnt samples
is shown in Fig. 6. In the unburnt sample (Fig. 6a), the morphotypes
which show a greater reduction in numbers per mg are those
related to the inﬂorescence (dendritic, echinate and verrucate long
cells, and papillae), whereas the rest are less affected. Note also that
the weathered morphotypes increase their number and relative
abundance signiﬁcantly. Overall, based on the relative abundances
in this fossil sample, verrucate long cells and papillae are the least
stable morphotypes and the P. elongate rugulates the most stable.
The burnt fossil sample (Fig. 6b) was prepared by heating
a portion of the homogenized fossil sample in an oven. Thus the
abundance of phytolith morphotypes in the unburnt and burnt
samples should be similar. This however is clearly not the case.
Furthermore the most abundant morphotype in the burnt sample
(wavy L.C.) is only the seventh most abundant morphotype in the
unburnt sample. The wavy L.C. morphotype is very thin, and

therefore almost invisible in the Entellan mounting medium (see
Discussion below). We suspect that the reason is the optical
contrast which is a function of both the refractive index and the
phytolith thickness. As the wavy L.C. morphotype is very thin, the
burning changed its refractive index (Elbaum et al., 2003) in such
a way as to make it visible. We tested this explanation by mounting
the fossil sample in a liquid with refractive index of 1.65 (as
opposed to the 1.49e1.50 of Entellan) and observed that the relative
abundances of morphotypes in the burnt and unburnt fossil sample
were similar using this refractive index liquid. Clearly Entellan is
a problematic mounting medium for phytolith studies and a more
suitable mounting medium needs to be used. This implies that
a comparison between the morphotypes in the unburnt and burnt
fossil phytolith assemblages cannot be performed directly.
The intra-sample changes in phytolith morphotypes in the burnt
fossil sample (Fig. 6b) shows a major decrease in phytolith numbers
in all morphotypes. In terms of relative abundance, wavy L.C.,
verrucate L.C. and papillae undergo a signiﬁcant decrease in their
percentage while P. elongate rugulates and weathered morphotypes increase in percentage following dissolution.
4. Discussion
Here we show that the solubilities of modern wheat phytolith
assemblages are greater than a 3000 year old fossil phytolith
assemblage composed mainly of domesticated cereals, and that

2486

burnt phytoliths are more soluble than unburnt phytoliths. We also
show that the stabilities of different phytolith morphotypes in both
the modern and fossil assemblages vary.
4.1. Phytolith solubility
In our dissolution experiments, the silicon concentrations
reached a steady state after one or two weeks. Thus the different
concentrations of silicon in solution are proportional to the
apparent solubilities of the various phytolith silica (opaline) phases
e the more silicon in solution, the more soluble is the phytolith
silica. The observation that modern extracted phytoliths are more
soluble than fossil phytoliths is consistent with previous studies on
the silica of diatoms and plant phytoliths (Kamatani, 1971). Fraysse
et al. (2006b) showed that plant extracted phytoliths are more
reactive than soil extracted phytoliths, indicating that the modern
phytoliths are more soluble. Even though our experiments were
carried out at pH 10 and 50  C, we can expect that at pH 8 to 8.5 (i.e.,
alkaline soils and ash accumulations worldwide) and ambient
temperatures, phytoliths will dissolve rapidly in the context of
“archaeological time” (years and not hundreds of years).
An interesting observation, and also possibly the key to understanding the basis for the solubility of phytoliths, is the observation
that burnt phytoliths are more soluble than unburnt phytoliths.
Heating biogenic silica removes the hydroxyl groups and bound
water (Jones and Segnit, 1969). This implies that the hydroxyl
groups and the bound water must stabilize the silica. A similar
observation has been made for amorphous calcium carbonate,
where the more stable phase contains equimolar amounts of bound
water and calcium carbonate, while the unstable phase is almost
devoid of bound water (Raz et al., 2003). Based on the above, the
different solubilities of wheat phytoliths from leaves/stems as
compared to the inﬂorescence measured in this study may reﬂect
the amounts of bound water and hydroxyl groups in the silica,
which in turn probably reﬂects the manner in which these phytoliths initially formed.
Our results and their implications (above) indicate that phytolith dissolution in sedimentary environments (archaeological
sediments and/or soils) is related to the water associated with the
phytoliths. If this water is lost during diagenesis, or the silicon,
probably in the form of dissolved monosilicic acid, is removed (by
plant roots for example), the phytoliths will dissolve more readily.
This implies that whether or not phytoliths are preserved in
archaeological sediments and/or soils depends upon the solubility
of the phytolith mineral, how robust the morphotype is, the local
hydrological regime, the local biological activity, and probably
other as yet unidentiﬁed factors. Furthermore, our experiments
indicate that burnt phytoliths are more soluble than unburnt
phytoliths, and hence more likely to be diagenetically altered. We
note that Fraysse et al. (2006b) did not observe noticeable changes
in phytolith solubility after heating at 450  C for 6 h and then
dissolving at pH 4, 6 and 8 for several days.
4.2. Phytolith morphotypes have different stabilities
Figs. 4 and 5 show that the changes in the relative amounts of
phytolith morphotypes after dissolution vary considerably. The
interpretation of this data is complicated by the fact that the
percent values are relative. Thus when one value changes, it affects
all other percent values. We partially alleviate this problem by also
presenting the data as numbers of identiﬁable phytoliths per
milligram of sample weight. This form of presentation, however,
highlights another problem, namely that the total number of phytoliths per milligram after dissolution is always much less than
before dissolution. We know that almost all the sample is

composed of opal (conﬁrmed by FTIR), even after 50% or more of
the sample’s initial weight has been lost. This means that the
observed reduction is in the number of identiﬁable phytoliths, with
the remaining opal being unidentiﬁable small fragments. As only
the identiﬁable phytoliths are analyzed when examining sediment
samples from archaeological sites, we normalized the total number
of identiﬁable phytoliths after dissolution to the number before
dissolution (Tables 2 and 3), and calculated the ratios of the identiﬁable phytoliths after dissolution over the identiﬁable phytoliths
before dissolution. In this way, a ratio of 1 indicates no difference
between the initial and ﬁnal amount of a certain morphotype,
while a ratio greater than 1 indicates relative stability and a ratio
smaller than 1 indicates relative instability. Using these ratios, we
can better understand the implications of differential loss of phytoliths on the interpretation of the phytolith assemblages in
archaeological sediments.
Table 2 shows that the ratios calculated for the modern samples
range between 0.0 and 15.0. About half of these (43%) have ratios
that fall between 0.6 and 1.8. We therefore assume that within this
range, the differences are small or not signiﬁcant. Here we discuss
only those that are below this range (37%) and hence relatively
unstable, and those with ratios above this range (20%) that are
relatively stable. The ratios calculated for the modern phytolith
assemblages show that hairs, papillae, bulliform parellelipedal
psilate, irregular psilate and sinuous long cells and verrucate long
cells are all relatively unstable. Cylindric psilates and parallelipipedal elongate rugulates appear to be relatively stable, but not
in leaf/stem samples.
An interpretation of the ratios of these and other morphotypes
only in terms of stable or unstable is complicated by two problems.
The problem with identifying thin phytoliths in Entellan, such as
the wavy long cell morphotype, and the problem that some morphotypes are not identiﬁable after partial dissolution and/or
mechanical abrasion. Furthermore, a morphotype such as the parallelipiped elongate rugulate has an elongated shape and a pitted

surface. Thus other morphotypes such as wavy, dendritic or echinate long cells can lose their decoration and become surface etched
during diagenesis, and will as a result be identiﬁed as parallelipiped
elongate rugulates (Fig. 7). Thus the proportions of rugulates
appears to increase, but not necessarily because they are very
stable. The ratios of the weathered morphotypes are particularly
high. Even though we show that some of these are present in the
modern plant, our experiments clearly show that more weathered
morphotypes are formed during the experiment. Echinate long
cells have a very low ratio in the modern burnt inﬂorescence
sample (0.1) compared to the unburnt modern inﬂorescence
sample (1.1). This is an example showing how the same morphotype reacts differently due to loss of bound water following
burning.
Table 3 shows that the ratios calculated for the fossil samples
range between 0.5 and 2.1; a rather narrow range in comparison to
the modern samples. This observation shows the relative stability
of the fossil assemblages, whether burnt or unburnt, in comparison
to the modern ones. In both unburnt and burnt fossil samples, the
verrucate long cells are the most unstable, followed by the papillae
in the burnt fossil sample. This implies that even though this fossil
assemblage is presumably a residual assemblage compared to
when it was formed 3000 years ago, further dissolution of 35% by
weight of the material still leads to 2 morphotypes, verrucate long
cells, and papillae, being less represented in the ﬁnal assemblage.
Only one signiﬁcant increase in stable morphotypes is found in the
two fossil assemblages, namely in the weathered morphotypes.
Note that in the fossil assemblages the initial percentage (Fig. 4a) of
the P. elongate rugulates is high, between 5 and 10% of the total
assemblage. Their ratio did not change signiﬁcantly following
dissolution.
Our data indicate that phytolith stability is determined by both
solubility and fragility. As stated above, the number of identiﬁable
phytoliths in 1 mg of opal was reduced following the experiments.
This is not expected if dissolution is the only mechanism acting on
the phytolith assemblage. It is thus conceivable that dissolution of
the weak morphotypes identiﬁed above using the ratios (e.g., wavy
long cells, verrucate long cells, hairs, papillae, and others) is
accompanied by breakage once dissolving morphotypes become
thinner, or have irregular thickness due to deep pitting. The ratio
between identiﬁable morphotypes and opaline debris might be an
important factor to examine in future studies.
4.3. Archaeological implications
Identiﬁcation of anatomical origins of phytoliths depends to
a large degree on speciﬁc indicative morphotypes. Based on our

2487

experiments some of these indicative morphotypes seem to be less
stable than others. In the case of inﬂorescences, it seems that hair
and papillae are relatively unstable, as are indicative ornamented
long cells. In the case of the leaves and stems, it appears that
indicative morphotypes such as rugulate bulliforms and parallelepipedal are less stable than most other morphotypes. These
results indicate that the phytoliths that suffer major changes in
their relative abundance due to dissolution/mechanical breakage
are some of the key phytoliths for identifying the part of the plant
from which they originated. Furthermore, in general the wheat
inﬂorescence phytoliths are more susceptible to degradation than
those from the leaves and stems. This can have important implications for interpreting phytolith assemblages in archaeological
sediments.
It is therefore of much importance to be able to evaluate
whether or not a fossil assemblage of phytoliths is well preserved or
poorly preserved, before interpreting its archaeological signiﬁcance. To date, the state of preservation of a fossil phytolith
assemblage has been evaluated by examining whether the surfaces
of all or many of the morphotypes are pitted and the decorations
are irregular (Fredlund and Tieszen, 1997). These properties are
certainly an indication of poor preservation. When such phytoliths
cannot be ascribed to a particular morphotype, then they are
designated as being “weathered”. The presence or absence of
weathered morphotypes is widely used as an indicator of phytolith
assemblage state of preservation. Our analyses show that weathered morphotypes are also present in the samples extracted from
modern leaves and stems prior to dissolution. In the leaves and
stems they constitute almost 10% of the common phytolith types
(Fig. 4). These pitted and irregular shaped phytoliths are either
present as such in the modern plant or were formed during
extraction, despite our efforts to avoid extreme pH conditions. We
note that their relative abundance increases after dissolution,
which is consistent with the interpretation that they are also the
product of diagenesis. These observations imply that not all the socalled weathered morphotypes are the product of weathering, and
they cannot be used indiscriminately to evaluate the state of
preservation of a phytolith assemblage. The so-called “weathered
morphotypes” in the original modern assemblages may reﬂect
incomplete siliciﬁcation of the plant cell when the phytoliths were
extracted.
Another possible indicator of preservation is the relative
proportion of the parallelepipedal elongate rugulate morphotype,
as this parameter was signiﬁcantly elevated in all our experiments
on modern wheat. This may imply that this morphotype is resistant
to dissolution in alkaline pH, or as noted it could be due to the loss
of decoration of some long cell phytoliths during the experiment.
This loss would cause other morphotypes to adopt the rugulate
appearance. For example, the loss of decoration from a verrucate
morphotype (which is more prone to dissolution and breakage than
other morphotypes) and the dissolution of its surface will result in
a rugulate appearance. Thus a high relative abundance of paralellepiped elongate regulates (Fig. 7a) in an archaeological sample
may reﬂect poor preservation, provided that some other argument
can be advanced to exclude the possibility that rugulates were not
derived from a part of the plant where they are abundant.
Perhaps the best indication of a well preserved assemblage is
the presence of abundant hairs, papillae and long cells with decorated margins, as all these morphotypes at least in wheat are
relatively unstable. The problem is that they are almost absent in
the stems/leaves.
The fact that different morphotypes have different stabilities
means that if a fossil assemblage of phytoliths is not well preserved,
then the relative amounts of the different morphotypes will change
and the archaeological interpretation, or the signiﬁcance of this

assemblage, will also change. In this study we show that the phytolith silica from the Tel Dor fossil sample is more insoluble than the
modern phytolith assemblages, implying that the more soluble
phytoliths have either totally or partially dissolved (resulting in ca.
10% P. elongate rugulate phytoliths and ca. 5% weathered morphotypes in the initial sample). We also show that if another 35% by
weight of this sample is dissolved (as occurred in our experiment),
the assemblage again changes. The detailed changes are listed in
Table 4.
When the unburnt assemblage was dissolved experimentally,
35% by weight was lost, while the burnt assemblage lost 48% by
weight. This is consistent with the fact that heating increases the
phytolith silica solubility. The most signiﬁcant change is in the

increase in the number of weathered phytoliths after dissolution.
All but one of the parameters listed changed signiﬁcantly in the
burnt sample, again reﬂecting its higher solubility. These results
clearly show that this fossil sample had not reached some steady
state where more dissolution would not make any signiﬁcant
difference.
Table 4 also shows the percent of leaf/stem and inﬂorescence
phytoliths before and after dissolution, as would be inferred from
the morphotype assemblage (Piperno, 1988, 2006; Rosen, 1992;
Twiss et al., 1969). The ratios of leaves/stems to inﬂorescence
change signiﬁcantly between the initial and ﬁnal assemblages. We
conducted one preliminary analysis of modern mature T. aestivum
whole plants which shows that around 60% of the phytoliths are

5. Concluding comment
Phytoliths are important micro-artifacts in archaeology. Like all
other artifacts in the archaeological record, their taphonomy/
diagenesis must be understood in order to evaluate the integrity of
this record. This study highlights the importance of understanding
these processes in order to correctly interpret archaeological phytolith assemblages.

leaf/stem phytoliths and 40% are inﬂorescence phytoliths. Note that
this ratio only represents mature T. aestivum and other closely
related species. The same species in an immature state could have
a somewhat different ratio. Thus we should expect similar
proportions of leaf and stem phytoliths if the phytoliths from the
whole cereal plant were all preserved in the sample. We would thus
conclude from the values obtained prior to dissolution that the
original fossil phytolith assemblage was enriched in the inﬂorescence component, and this would imply a site where cereals were
mainly stored. After exposure to alkaline pH, the proportion of leaf/
stem phytoliths increases, and it cannot be concluded that this
assemblage was enriched in inﬂorescences. Table 4 also shows
a signiﬁcant decrease in the percentage of anatomically connected
phytoliths (silica skeletons) in the burnt fossil sample after dissolution. Such a change was also experimentally observed by (Costa
et al., 2010). This also has archaeological implications as this
parameter is sometimes used as an indicator for water availability
to plants (Jenkins, 2009; Rosen and Weiner, 1994.) This exercise
demonstrates how the interpretation of phytolith assemblages
might change as a result of diagenesis.
Broader questions that need to be addressed are why phytolith
concentrations are often much higher in archaeological sites as
compared to the surrounding sediments, and if phytoliths are
absent or in low concentrations in a site or a particular stratum
within a site, what are the reasons? This study shows that phytolith opal solubility is such that with a slow ﬂow the associated
ground water will rapidly reach a steady state concentration of
silicon, and if conditions do not change, phytoliths will not
dissolve further. Thus the past hydrological conditions will
directly inﬂuence phytoliths preservation. As root activity can
cause phytoliths to dissolve, the formation of soil during a period
of abandonment at a site can affect the preservation of anthropogenic deposited phytoliths, and in addition may introduce into
the sediments phytoliths of natural origin. Testing a scenario of
soil formation on site can be done using micromorphology. In this
respect it must be stressed that phytolith assemblages from soils
and paleosols are likely to be altered. Relatively good preservation
of phytoliths may occur where a paleocatena was quickly buried.
Rapid burial is in general consistent with good preservation of
fossil assemblages, in both the macroscopic and microscopic
records.

We would like to thank Yotam Asscher for his help during the
development of the fossil phytolith extraction system and Dr. Elisabetta Boaretto for helpful comments. We also thank Profs Ayellet
Gilboa and Ilan Sharon for the sample from Tel Dor. The research
leading to these results was funded by the European Research
Council under the European Community’s Seventh Framework
Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC grant agreement n 229418. D.C.
postdoctoral fellowship is also funded by the Beatriu de Pinós
program (Departament d’Universitats, Recerca i Societat de la
Informació de la Generalitat de Catalunya). The authors are
members of the Research Group for Palaecological and Geoarchaeological Studies (GEPEG).
