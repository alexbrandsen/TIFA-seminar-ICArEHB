Comprehensive review of archaeological data shows that Sahul (Pleistocene Australia-New Guinea) was
ﬁrst occupied by humans ca. 47 ka (47,000 years ago); evidence for earlier arrival is weak. Colonizing
populations remained low e perhaps two orders of magnitude below those estimated at European
contact e for many millennia, and were long restricted to relatively favorable habitats. Though human
arrival coincided with changes in native ﬂora and fauna, these were mainly the products of climatic
factors, not human interference. The genetic makeup of founding populations and their arrival date are
consistent with the Late Dispersal Model of anatomically modern humans beyond SW Asia, beginning ca.
50 ka. Early Dispersal Models (120e70 ka) are not refuted, but draw no support from the Sahul record as
currently understood.

1. Introduction
A decade ago, we presented two critical reviews of evidence for
the date at which humans ﬁrst occupied Sahul (Allen and
O'Connell, 2003; O'Connell and Allen, 2004). Continuing dispute
about this issue, recent improvements in chronometric techniques,
and reports of new sites and dates led us to undertake another
assessment, the details of which are presented elsewhere (Allen
and O'Connell, 2014). Here we summarize key elements of that
exercise and consider their implications for current ideas about the
process of Sahul colonization, its impact on terrestrial habitats and
resources, and the timing of anatomically modern human dispersals beyond Africa.

2. Background
In the 1980s, it was argued that anatomically modern humans
had colonized Sahul by 40 ka (e.g. White with O'Connell, 1982;
Flood, 1983; Allen, 1989). The coincidence with the earliest dates
for the European Upper Paleolithic suggested that both developments were part of the same process: the rapid dispersal of

modern humans from Africa across Eurasia and ultimately into
Sahul 40e45 ka (e.g. Cann et al., 1987; Stringer and Andrews, 1988).
Subsequent reports of 50e60 ka luminescence dates from two
archaeological sites in Arnhem Land (Roberts et al., 1990, 1994),
Malakunanja II (now called Madjedbebe) and Nauwalabila, challenged this notion. Proponents of these early dates observed that
the Sahul chronology was based mainly on radiocarbon dating, that
40 ka was at or near this method's operational limit, and that small
amounts of contamination could result in “old” samples yielding
much younger apparent ages (Roberts et al., 1994; Chappell et al.,
1996). Dates from the two Arnhem Land sites were widely
viewed as important indicators of the limits of radiocarbon dating
and of the more likely age of Sahul colonization. The challenge to
broader arguments about ex-African human dispersal chronologies, also based on radiocarbon dating, was implicit but obvious.
Some maintained that, despite concerns about sample
contamination, the date for Sahul colonization might well have
been about 40e45 ka, consistent with then standard European and
broader Eurasian models (e.g. O'Connell and Allen, 1998). These
commentators raised crucial questions about the Arnhem Land
sites, speciﬁcally about the stratigraphic relationships between
dated media (energy trapped in sand grains) and archaeological
phenomena (stone tools) at these two locations (e.g. Bowdler, 1990;
Hiscock, 1990; O'Connell and Allen, 1998). If these relationships
were not secure, any argument about the anthropological implications of the dates was meaningless.

Our 2003/2004 reviews concluded that people had arrived and
spread widely across Sahul by 43e45 ka, but found that evidence
for an earlier presence, particularly one >50 ka, was weak. Our
conclusion was broadly consistent with some aspects of thencurrent arguments about the effect of human arrival on indigenous megafauna (e.g. Roberts et al., 2001), but contradicted other
ideas about a purported pre-50 ka arrival and impact, not only on
native plant and animal communities but also on regional climate
systems (e.g. Miller et al., 1999). Equally important, our assessment
provided a basis for estimates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
mutation rates, which in turn contributed to the development and
critique of various Upper Pleistocene ex-African human dispersal
scenarios (e.g. Endicott et al., 2009; Henn et al., 2012; cf.
Oppenheimer, 2009; Petraglia et al., 2010). Nevertheless, a >50 ka
arrival date is still asserted in some quarters (e.g. Cane, 2013;
Hiscock, 2013; Smith, 2013; Oppenheimer, 2014). No ﬁnal resolution of this issue has yet been achieved, and it remains crucial to
arguments about the process of Sahul colonization and its impact
on indigenous fauna and ﬂora, as well as to ongoing disputes about
the timing of Upper Pleistocene human diasporas and the identities
of the populations involved.
Recent developments in dating technology provided the basis
for an updated review. These include: 1) more frequent use of pretreatment methods that extend the applicability of radiocarbon
dating back to ca. 50e55 ka (Bird et al., 1999); 2) widespread use of
accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) as a means of generating
more precise estimates of radiocarbon content (but see Hogg et al.,
2013; Allen and O'Connell, 2014:87); 3) construction of calibration
curves that allow accurate calendar-age estimates from 14C dates
for samples much older than a previous limit of ca. 26 ka (e.g. Bronk
Ramsey et al., 2012; Reimer et al., 2013), and 4) new radiocarbon
and luminescence dates from sites previously described, as well as
from those reported for the ﬁrst time following our 2003/2004
reviews.
3. Sahul sites dated 40e47 ka
Table 1 lists the 26 archaeological sites or localities that offer
relatively reliable, relatively well-published evidence of an
anatomically modern human presence in Sahul, Wallacea and the
Bismarck Archipelago by about 40,000 years ago. The two oldest
dates for the occupation of Tasmania (ca. 38e39 ka) are also noted.
Fig. 1 provides a graphic summary of this information; Fig. 2 shows
the distribution of all sites listed in Table 1. All radiocarbon dates
were calibrated by reference to OxCal 4.2, using the IntCal 13 curve.
The Southern Hemisphere offset SHCal 13 was not applied since
dates derived from that routine in this age range fall within the
standard deviations of unadjusted determinations. A further seven
recently reported sites with claimed archaeological dates 40e47 ka
are not referenced here because of incomplete information on
stratigraphic provenience, relationships with evidence of human
presence, or the dates themselves (Allen and O'Connell, 2014).
Their inclusion would have no signiﬁcant effect on this discussion.
Early dates from 21 sites were determined solely by radiocarbon, those from another three by a combination of radiocarbon
and luminescence, and those from the remaining four by luminescence or U-series analyses. Most radiocarbon samples were
subjected to acid-base-acid or acid-base-oxidation-stepped combustion (ABOX-SC) pretreatment; all but three (from GRE 8,
Matenkupkum, Upper Swan) were analyzed by accelerator mass
spectrometry. All carbon dates were derived from charcoal or shell
collected from sedimentary strata containing evidence of human
activity. The oldest dates from four sites (Devil's Lair, Menindee,
Riwi, PACD H1) pertain to samples retrieved from anthropogenic
thermal features (probably hearths or roasting pits) and are

regarded as especially secure with respect to their implications for
the date of human presence. Luminescence and U-series age estimates were derived from sediment samples and are generally
marked by much wider conﬁdence intervals (Fig. 1).
4. What about Nauwalabila and Madjedbebe?
As indicated above, excavations at Nauwalabila and Madjedbebe
(both located north of Nawarla Gabarnmang, Fig. 2) yielded stone
tools in association with sediments dated by luminescence at
50e60 ka (Roberts et al., 1990, 1994). Detailed re-analysis of data
from Nauwalabila showed that the relationship between artifacts
and dated sediments was probably the result of post-depositional
disturbance, and that claims for human presence at this location
greater than about 40 ka were unsupportable (Allen and O'Connell,
2003; cf. Bird et al., 2002). The sedimentary situation at Madjedbebe is similar to that at Nauwalabila but has been much less fully
reported, making any serious evaluation of a proposed 50e60 ka
human presence there difﬁcult. The results of renewed excavations
undertaken at Madjedbebe in 2012 may change matters once they
are made public (see also below).
5. Discussion
Data presented in Table 1 show that humans reached Sahul by
47 ka. The difference from our 2003/2004 estimate of 43e45 ka is
mainly a function of more precise radiocarbon date calibration at
greater time depth than was possible when we wrote. That, combined with more effective sample pretreatment, allows the technique to generate accurate dates of 50e55 ka. With that in mind,
we take the absence of reliable archaeological dates greater than
47 ka to indicate an outer bound for continental colonization.
Contrary to claims made in the 1990s, and continuing in the recent
literature (e.g. Oppenheimer, 2012; Cane, 2013; Hiscock, 2013;
Smith, 2013), this is not a function of methodological constraints
on radiocarbon dating. We discount claims for earlier age estimates
based on luminescence and U-series analyses, not because of concerns about the dates themselves (although that issue certainly
merits critical attention, as is the case with any dating technique),
but because of uncertainties about the evidence of human presence
and its relationship with the dates. On current evidence, an age
estimate >50 ka from a new or already known site would be a
deﬁnite outlier in the early continental chronology (more on this
below).
5.1. Site distribution and process of colonization
Though still small, the sample of sites listed in Table 1 is sufﬁcient to support speculative comment on the pattern and process of
initial colonization. Analysts mostly agree that founding populations arrived in Sahul along Birdsell's (1977) northern and/or
southern routes across Wallacea, via Sulawesi and/or Timor,
respectively (Fig. 2). As argued elsewhere (O'Connell et al., 2010),
travel east of Sunda probably involved hundreds of individuals and
was almost certainly deliberate, if not always unidirectional. It
required the use of well-made watercraft, some large enough to
carry perhaps as many as a dozen people as well as several days'
supply of food and water. Paddle-powered (possibly even saildriven), such craft must have been capable of maintaining headway under a wide range of conditions, including moderately contrary currents.
Although the southern route is widely identiﬁed as the main
avenue of access to Sahul, we think the northern route was more
likely because of the consistent island inter-visibility and shorter
voyaging distances it offered (Irwin, 1992; Allen and O'Connell,

2008). In contrast, at 45e50 ka, when sea levels were 60e80 m
below modern, the last leg on the southern route (Timor-Sahul)
required a 200 km open-ocean crossing, twice the length of any of
those on the northern route, and longer than any other voyage
documented in this part of the world for the next 20,000 years
(Allen and O'Connell, 2008; O'Connell et al., 2010). Moreover, return voyages, vital to the recruitment of additional colonists and
the establishment of viable populations in Sahul, would have been
very difﬁcult, given the strong, south-ﬂowing currents that prevail
between Timor and the mainland (Wild, 1985:69; Irwin, 1992:28;
Hautala et al. 2001).
Opinions differ concerning what happened next. Hypothetical
scenarios vary on a continuum from rapid, continent-wide colonization, unimpeded by inter-regional differences in climate and
environment (Birdsell, 1957), through long-term restriction to
particular habitats as a function of cultural traditions that prevailed
in colonizer homelands (Bowdler, 1977). (For models falling between these extremes see Hallam, 1977; Horton, 1981; White with
O'Connell, 1982; Jones, 1989; Beaton, 1991; Webb and Rindos, 1997;
Chappell, 2000; O'Connor and Veth, 2000; Bird et al., 2004;
Bulbeck, 2007; Hiscock, 2008; Davidson, 2010, 2013; Smith, 2013).
Our own expectations about the colonization process are
grounded in optimal foraging theory and further informed by
recent work on modern hunter-gatherer economics. These have led
us to develop several hypotheses about movement around and

across the continent as determined by variation in the costs and
beneﬁts of subsistence (O'Connell and Allen, 2012). (The same
theoretical reasoning applies to movement through Wallacea
[O'Connell et al., 2010]). We propose that major river basins contained the terrestrial habitats most attractive to human foragers,
and that the vast interior arid zone, away from the coast and
without perennial rivers and streams, was the least attractive.
Some tropical forest settings may have been low ranked as well,
due to the limited, often high-cost resource arrays they commonly
offer to hunter-gatherers (e.g. Sillitoe, 2002; Cosgrove et al., 2007;
cf. Roscoe, 2005). We propose that all other terrestrial habitats were
of intermediate rank, scaled positively by the availability of water
and negatively by the lower mean temperatures and correspondingly lower levels of productivity generally associated with higher
latitudes and elevations.
We suggest that coasts marked by steeply sloping shorelines
and rocky substrates were consistently attractive to foragers,
despite the frequent, high amplitude changes in sea level characteristic of this period (Marine Isotope Stage 3 [MIS-3], 30e60 ka;
Siddall et al., 2003), given the capacities of resident fauna (specifically shellﬁsh) to adjust to those changes in real time (Beaton,
1995). On the other hand, the narrowness of the intertidal zone
in these settings meant that potential prey were relatively few in
number and hence susceptible to rapid depletion by humans.
Broad, shallow coastal ﬂats and estuaries were marked by greater

resource diversities and higher prey densities and so should have
been more appealing, just as they were historically (Birdsell, 1953).
But their productivity may have been disrupted by those same MIS3 sea level changes: the sedimentary substrates supporting that
productivity may often have required centuries to reform in the
wake of rapid rises and falls (Chappell, 1993). Data and opinion on
this point are mixed (e.g. Beaton, 1985; Barham, 2000; Chappell,
2005; Bulbeck, 2007; Pope and Terrell, 2008:7e8; Manne and
Veth, 2015; Ward et al. 2015), but we still consider it unlikely
that these settings were as common, productive, and attractive to
MIS-3 humans as they were from mid-Holocene times onward.
We argue that movement within and between coastal and
terrestrial habitats was determined mainly by human depletion of
high ranked prey. Declines in their availability made shifts to
relatively rich but still unexploited patches elsewhere economically
attractive. Given the generally low productivity of terrestrial Sahul
habitats, a pattern exacerbated by the low temperature, precipitation and CO2 values characteristic of Late Glacial times, resource
depletion and subsequent human relocation may have been relatively rapid, even on a continental scale.
The distribution of early sites (Table 1, Fig. 2) is broadly consistent with these expectations. The oldest archaeological dates in

each of the three northernmost latitudinal segments (Ivane Vilakauv [Highland New Guinea], Nawarla Gabarnmang [Arnhem
Land], Devil's Lair and Menindee [SW and SE Australia, respectively]) are all in the range 45e47 ka, even though the latter two are
several thousand kilometers from likely points of initial continental
landfall in the northwest. The absence of similarly early dates from
Tasmania reﬂects the fact that a dry land connection with the
mainland Australia was not established until sometime after 43 ka
(Lambeck and Chappell, 2001).
The distribution of early sites along the southwestern, western
and northeastern margins of the continent generally ﬁts with expectations about early reliance on coastal and riverine resources.
Five of the 25 sites shown in Fig. 2 (Jansz [central W coast]), Jerimalai, Lene Hara [Timor], Matenkupkum, Buang Merabak [New
Ireland]) were within a few hundred meters of the shore when ﬁrst
occupied; one (Devil's Lair) was within a day's walk. Offshore
proﬁles near all are steep, suggesting the presence of persistently
attractive littoral habitats in the absence of human predation. Three
localities are in the lower reaches of large river basins: Menindee
and Willandra in the Murray-Darling, and the Swan River site (SW
Australia). Seven sites are located in the upper reaches of smaller
but still sizable river drainages: Carpenter's Gap and Riwi in the

Fitzroy-Meda (Kimberley), Djadjiling and Ganga Mara in the Fortescue (Pilbara), GRE 8 and Ngarrabullgan in the Carpentarian, and
Nawarla Gabarnmang in the Katherine (Arnhem Land). These data
are all consistent with model-based expectations, as is the nearcomplete absence of early dates from the arid continental core
away from sizable rivers or the coast. The slightly later occupation
of Tasmania follows the same pattern: the earliest sites are all
located in river valleys, adjacent to the rivers themselves.
Apparent exceptions to expectations include the several early
sites in the Ivane Valley, the far southern arid zone site of Allen's
Cave, and the lowland tropical forest site of Yombon (New Britain).
Despite its altitude (2000 masl) and distance from the coaste at
least three days' walk over rough terrain, the Ivane situation (all
sites overlooking a pandanus swamp and close to the valley's
rivers) offered early colonists an opportunity to exploit the alpine
forest-grassland ecotone. This was a favorable habitat for New
Guinea hunters historically, perhaps even more so in the distant
past (e.g. Hope and Hope, 1976). Allen's Cave and Yombon are both
situated in relatively unattractive settings e arid desert and

lowland rainforest, respectively. Still, Yombon was close to a major
river and roughly a day's walk from the coast. The presence of a
nearby toolstone source may have been an important attraction
(Pavlides and Gosden, 1994). Allen's Cave, located in an extensive
limestone formation that has elsewhere yielded evidence of toolstone quarrying (Wright, 1971; Lowry and Jennings, 1974), may
have been used for the same purpose, although published reports
(e.g. Roberts et al., 1996) offer no evidence to support this suggestion. Alternatively, it may have been occupied for short periods of
time by foragers drawn inland from the coast by occasional rainrelated resource “ﬂushes.”
Other distributional data that challenge our model include the
low numbers of early sites so far reported from the CarpentarianEyre Basin-Murray-Darling region and their complete absence
along the well-watered E Australian coast and hinterlands
(compare the Pleistocene site map in Langley et al., 2011 with the
Holocene map in Ulm, 2011). This might mean that postdepositional processes have covered or eroded evidence of early
human presence, or that research has been insufﬁcient to identify

78

it. The latter explanation seems unlikely for the coast and nearby
hinterland in view of the development that large parts of that
landscape have witnessed over the last century. It might well be
that some of these areas were unoccupied early on, but we would
ﬁnd that surprising (Hughes et al., 2014; but see Bowdler, 2010).
Overall, the post-colonization pattern is now seen to differ from
both the rapid, pan-continental and slow, culturally constrained,
coastally oriented models proposed by Birdsell (1957) and Bowdler
(1977), respectively. Continental-scale occupation was apparently
rapid but selectively distributed across a range of favorable habitat
types e prominent along some coasts and in certain especially
attractive interior situations, but absent elsewhere for many
millennia. The archaeological “footprint” measured by site
numbers, refuse deposition rates and radiocarbon date counts is
also light, not only for the 6000e7000 years after landing, but from
then on through the terminal Pleistocene, nearly thirty thousand
years later (e.g. Lourandos, 1980; Beaton, 1985; Lourandos and Ross,
1994; O'Connell and Allen, 2012; Williams, 2013). The obvious
implication is that human population numbers remained very low
throughout this time, perhaps in the tens of thousands continentwide, roughly two orders of magnitude below the several million
range estimated for Australia-New Guinea combined at European
contact (Brookﬁeld with Hart, 1971; Williams, 2013). As suggested
elsewhere (O'Connell and Allen, 2012), low glacial-era environmental productivity produced by low temperature, precipitation
and CO2 values, combined with high levels of relatively short-term
climatic instability may have been responsible.
5.2. Habitat modiﬁcation and megafaunal extinctions
Our estimated 47 ka human arrival threshold matches more or
less closely with dated evidence said to mark signiﬁcant colonizer
impacts on Sahul fauna and ﬂora. These purportedly included the
widespread displacement of ﬁre-sensitive with ﬁre-tolerant ﬂora,
sub-continental scale reductions in tree cover, a consequent decline
in evapotranspiration rates leading to drastic diminution in the
strength of the summer monsoon, and the rapid, Australia-wide
elimination of >60 species of large-bodied marsupials, birds and
reptiles, all in the period 45e50 ka (e.g. Roberts et al., 2001; Miller
et al., 2005; Gillespie et al., 2006; Brook et al., 2007; Turney et al.,
2008; Prideaux et al., 2010; Roberts and Brook, 2010; Rule et al.,
2012; Lopes de Santos et al., 2013). Changes in ﬂora are said to
have been brought about through human use of ﬁre as a foraging
tool and/or by the elimination of large animal consumers. Large
animal extinctions are attributed to some combination of human
predation and ﬁre-induced vegetation change. Arguments in favor
of these propositions differ in various ways, but human interference is the catalytic element in all of them. Non-anthropogenic
climate change is taken to have been limited in this time frame,
and hence irrelevant to any changes in biota.
Counter-arguments developed over the last decade hold that
the ecological changes noted above were likely to have been mainly
climate-driven. Shifts in ﬂora and the disappearance of megafauna
are seen to have been connected with a general trend from 350 to
400 ka onward toward increased continental aridity and progressively lower glacial-period temperatures and atmospheric CO2
values (e.g. Kershaw et al., 2003; Price et al., 2011). Proponents of
this view observe that by the time humans arrived, only 8e14
large-bodied taxa, from a total of 88 or more now-extinct Pleistocene forms across New Guinea and Australia combined, were
deﬁnitely still extant (Wroe and Field, 2006; Wroe et al., 2013). Up
to eight of these may have persisted until as recently as 28 ka
(Trueman et al., 2005; Field et al., 2008; Fillios et al., 2010; cf. Grün
et al., 2010). Changes in vegetation and related shifts in ﬁre frequency over the period 70e10 ka, monitored via pollen and

charcoal spectra, correlate with high-amplitude, millennial scale
Dansgaard-Oeschger temperature cycles and with extremely cold,
centennial-scale Heinrich Events (Mooney et al., 2011). These
phenomena are well marked in high latitude ice cores (e.g.
€ris, 2008) and clearly evident in tropical and
Weninger and Jo
southern temperate zone proxies, including some from Sahul (e.g.
Burns et al., 2003; Turney et al., 2004; Brown et al., 2007; Dürkop
et al., 2008; Hunt et al., 2012; Denniston et al., 2013). Their effect
on Sahul megafauna is still unresolved, but a causal link with extinctions cannot be dismissed (For additional case studies and
discussion in support of this line of argument see Kershaw et al.,
2003; Webb, 2008; Cosgrove et al., 2010; Faith and O'Connell,
2011; Cohen et al., 2012; Kaal et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2012;
Sakaguchi et al., 2013; Habeck-Fardy and Nanson, 2014; LimaRibeiro and Dinez-Filho, 2014).
While there is no direct evidence of human predation on nowextinct large animals anywhere in Sahul (no kill sites, no stone
tool cut-marked or impact-scarred bones), we would be surprised if
human colonizers failed to take megafauna whenever possible. The
question is whether low human numbers and patchy distribution
across the continent would have allowed them to drive 8e14 taxa
(let alone 60e>80) to extinction within one or two millennia in the
absence of other contributing factors. Simulation studies claimed to
support this possibility are based on unrealistically high estimates
of post-colonization human population growth rates. At the 1e2.5%
per annum ﬁgure posited by Brook and Bowman (2004), for
example, a founding group of 500 grows to several million in less
than two millennia. Archaeological data summarized above show
that human populations remained well below this level until the
middle Holocene. Parallel arguments (e.g. Brook and Johnson,
2006) indicating that low kill rates involving sub-adult individuals might have led to rapid demographic collapse yet leave
little archaeological evidence are theoretically plausible, but
limited by the fact that they have so far considered only the largest,
hence slowest reproducing Sahul taxon e Diprotodon optatum.
Smaller-bodied taxa (e.g. Protemnodon, Sthenurus, both present
when humans arrived) were probably marked by earlier ages at
maturity and higher reproductive rates (Charnov, 1993; Zou et al.,
2013), and so were far less vulnerable on this count. (Note too
that, simulation results notwithstanding, Diprotodon is one of
several megafaunal taxa that may have persisted for many
millennia after human arrival [Field et al., 2008]).
Assertions about the environmental impact of early anthropogenic landscape-scale ﬁre are based mainly on two data sets. One,
from the Lake Eyre Basin (south central Australia), includes stable
isotope readings on eggshells from two ﬂightless birds, emu and
larger, now-extinct Genyornis. These are read to indicate an abrupt
shift, dated 45e50 ka, from tree/shrub savannah to desert scrub, a
transition characterized as a “massive ecosystem collapse,” entirely
attributable to the introduction of a human-mediated ﬁre regime
(Miller et al., 2005, 2007). The other body of evidence includes
pollen, charcoal and other material contained in long sediment
cores extracted from Lynch's Crater, a volcanic caldera in NE
Australia. These data point to an increase in ﬁre frequency and a
related shift from mixed rainforest to drier sclerophyll vegetation
beginning ca. 45 ka. Both are said to have been caused either by the
establishment of an anthropogenic ﬁre regime (Kershaw, 1986;
Turney et al., 2001b) or by human elimination of large-bodied
herbivores, the latter leading to an increase in fuel loads that in
turn promoted more frequent ﬁres (Rule et al., 2012). Climate
change is explicitly dismissed as a contributing factor in both cases.
The environmental changes reported in these two situations
appear to have been signiﬁcant; the questions are whether they
were as extreme as suggested, whether they coincided with human
arrival, and whether they were the result of human interference. As

J.F. O'Connell, J. Allen / Journal of Archaeological Science 56 (2015) 73e84

noted above, a number of recent studies make strong arguments in
favor of climate as the primary catalyst, with humans assigned at
most a minor contributing role (e.g. Mooney et al., 2011; Bowman
et al., 2012; Bird et al., 2013). The idea that changes in Eyre Basin
vegetation were “abrupt” or solely related to human action is
contradicted by reanalysis of some of the same stable isotope and
geomorphological data cited in support of that interpretation,
showing instead a continuous trend toward drier conditions
beginning about 80 ka, well in advance of human presence (Notaro
et al., 2011; Cohen et al., 2012; Murphy et al., 2012; Habeck-Fardy
and Nanson, 2014). The Lynch's Crater data are increasingly characterized as unreliable markers of human action, given the difﬁculty of distinguishing possible anthropogenic effects from those
attributable to climate in this setting (Lynch et al., 2007; Bliege Bird
et al., 2008; Murphy and Bowman, 2012; Bird et al., 2013).
Assumptions about the scale of early human impact are crucial
here. Advocates of strictly anthropogenic causality assume that
human-controlled ﬁres had a much greater effect on vegetation
than those generated by non-anthropogenic ignition sources, speciﬁcally lightning. This discounts the evidence that ﬁre has been a
major ecological force all across Sahul for millions of years (e.g.
Lynch et al., 2007). It also assumes that initial human population
densities and distributions were similar to those responsible for the
maintenance of anthropogenic ﬁre regimes reported historically
(e.g. Gammage, 2011). And it ignores ethnographic observations
showing that human-mediated landscape-scale ﬁres are orders of
magnitude smaller in extent and ecologically less disruptive than
the larger of those generated by lightning. As Bliege Bird and
colleagues (2012) have observed, human-controlled ﬁre in low
population settings buffers the impact of non-anthropogenic ﬁre e
it does not exacerbate or exceed it as a disruptive force. This
observation is based on the use of ﬁre during the recent Aboriginal
reoccupation of parts of the Western Desert, and for that reason
seems likely to apply with similar, if not equal force to the early
stages of Sahul colonization.
The effect of human arrival on Sahul ﬂora and fauna remains
controversial. Some impact seems likely in principle, but the case
for massive, anthropogenic ﬁre-related ecosystem collapse and
catastrophic megafaunal overkill is far less clear-cut. Ironically, a
secure estimate for human colonization ca. 47 ka offers no
compelling support for these propositions (cf. Roberts et al., 2001).
We agree with those who see climate as the primary determinant of
ecological change in Late Pleistocene Sahul, with humans having a
signiﬁcant impact only from early/mid Holocene times onward,
when their populations achieved densities and distributions
similar to those observed at the time of European contact
(Williams, 2013).
5.3. Sahul and Late Pleistocene human dispersals beyond E Africa/
SW Asia
The ﬁnding that humans arrived in Sahul ca. 47 ka also speaks to
current arguments about the Upper Pleistocene spread of
anatomically modern humans (AMH) beyond Africa. Key questions
concern the number and timing of such movement(s), the identities
of the populations involved, and the ecological and evolutionary
forces driving the process. Discussion is complicated by limited and
controversial hominin fossil and archaeological data, by uncertainties about the phylogenetic signiﬁcance of the fossil evidence, by the complexities of modeling and dating a rapidly
growing genomic database, and by the difﬁculties of linking
archaeological evidence with populations deﬁned on biological
grounds (Davidson, 2014). Detailed review is well beyond us here,
but some general observations on the timing and population
identity issues are in order.

79

Current consensus favors a sub-Saharan African origin of AMH
in the late Middle Pleistocene (Klein, 2009). Opinions about later
movement beyond Africa are divided between two alternatives: 1)
a Late Dispersal Model (LDM), initially into SW Asia at about 60 ka,
then accelerating across Eurasia and into Sahul beginning about
50 ka; 2) an Early Dispersal Model (EDM) involving an initial move
across S Asia as early as the Last Interglacial (100e120 ka) followed
by a later spread into N Eurasia, again after 50 ka.
The LDM ﬁnds strong support from genetic data (e.g. Wollstein
et al., 2010; Gronau et al., 2012; Hernandez et al., 2011; Poznik et al.,
2013). The pattern is particularly clear from analyses of modern and
fossil human mitochondrial (mt) DNA, still the best characterized
locus for dating human migrations (e.g. Endicott et al., 2009; Soares
et al., 2009, 2012; Behar et al., 2012; Fernandes et al., 2012; Henn
et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2013b; Mellars et al., 2013b; Rito et al.,
2013). These studies conﬁrm and elaborate the observation,
initially made by Cann et al. (1987), that all modern non-African
populations trace the mitochondrial component of their genomes
to an African source, now called the L3 lineage. Groups representing
this lineage are thought to have spread from East Africa to SW Asia
roughly 70e60 ka. Consideration of relevant climatic data suggests
that this movement may have taken place close to 60 ka, or perhaps
shortly after, coincident with the warmer temperatures and
increased precipitation values associated with the onset of MIS-3
(Eriksson et al., 2012; Boivin et al., 2013; Parton et al., 2013). Preceding MIS-4 (70e60 ka) was marked by extreme aridity all across
northern Africa and Arabia, inhibiting any move into SW Asia until
conditions improved. If L3-related populations did venture beyond
Africa during MIS-4, their distributions are likely to have been
restricted to a few widely scattered, relatively favorable locations,
including the coastal margins of the Arabian Peninsula and the
riverine corridor exposed by sea level falls in what is now the
Persian Gulf (Rose, 2010; Fernandes et al., 2012; Mellars et al.,
2013a).
Once they reached SW Asia, L3-related populations apparently
remained in place for several thousand years e long enough to
allow introgression with local Neandertals, an inference based on
nuclear DNA (Green et al., 2010; Sankararaman et al., 2012; Fu
et al., 2014; see also Hershkovitz et al. 2015), and the subsequent development of three mitochondrial daughter lineages, N,
N
R, and possibly M (Atkinson et al., 2009; Fernandes et al., 2012;
Mellars et al., 2013b). Archaeological, fossil and genetic data
indicate movement beyond SW Asia beginning ca. 50 ka, reaching
east to the exposed Sunda Shelf no later than ca. 48 ka (Barker
et al., 2007; Hudjashov et al., 2007; Atkinson et al., 2008;
Demeter et al., 2012) and north into Eurasia at about the same
time or slightly later (Hoffecker, 2009; Richter et al., 2009; Henn
et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2014). Rapid transit across S Asia to Sahul
is indicated by the absence of geographic hierarchy in L3-derived
daughter lineages along this arc (e.g. Macaulay et al., 2005;
Friedlaender et al., 2007; Hudjashov et al., 2007; Soares et al.,
2009; van Holst Pellekaan, 2013). Macro-haplogroups M, N and
N
R are all represented in Sahul; all early Sahul-speciﬁc lineages
within these haplogroups are derived directly from SW Asian
sources rather than S Asian intermediates, implying eastward
movement faster than the mtDNA mutation rate. (Haplogroup M
may represent a partial exception regarding source: S vs. SW Asia
[see Mellars et al., 2013b for discussion]). Introgression with
archaic Denisovans occurred at some point(s) in this transit,
perhaps in SE Asia (Reich et al., 2011; Rasmussen et al., 2011; cf.
Cooper and Stringer, 2013).
Our revised assessment of Sahul colonization dates is consistent
with this scenario. It seems increasingly likely that the initial
occupation of Pleistocene Australia-New Guinea was part of a rapid,
Eurasia-wide expansion of AMH beyond SW Asia beginning about

80

50 ka (Henn et al., 2012). One might question the validity of the
correlation, in that 1) some estimates of the mitochondrial mutation rate have employed a 45e50 ka Sahul colonization date as an
analytic benchmark (e.g. Endicott et al., 2009), introducing potential circularity, and 2) recent studies of the nuclear genome (e.g.
Scally and Durbin, 2012) have suggested a signiﬁcantly slower
mutation rate, which would push autosomal estimates of the exit
from Africa much further back in time. However, subsequent analyses of mtDNA from ten radiocarbon dated European and E Asian
AMH fossils (Fu et al., 2014) independently indicate a rate consistent with those calibrated on a 45e50 ka Sahul arrival time. The age
for Q, the oldest known autochthonous N Sahul mitochondrial
haplogroup, calculated on this fossil-derived mutation rate, is
estimated at 42 ka (95% CI: 30e54 ka; Fu et al., 2013b: Table 3),
which ﬁts, within the limits of these methodologies, with both our
revised Sahul archaeological chronology and with the Late
Dispersal Model.
Arguments in favor of an earlier Upper Pleistocene dispersal rely
on various combinations of human fossil, archaeological and genetic evidence (e.g. Oppenheimer, 2012). Fossil-based scenarios
highlight the presence of AMH or similar morphologies in pre-60 ka
contexts in E and SE Asia (e.g. Shen et al., 2002; Westaway et al.,
2007; Liu et al., 2010; Mijares et al., 2010). All are plausible, but
open to challenge on the reliability of fossil identiﬁcations as AMH,
the validity of proposed dates, or their associations with the fossils
in question. Archaeological models are based on claims for Africanderived Middle Paleolithic or Middle Stone Age lithic assemblages
and reduction sequences dated 120e70 ka in Arabia and S Asia (e.g.
Foley and Lahr, 1997; Petraglia et al., 2010, 2012; Armitage et al.,
2012; Clarkson et al., 2012; Dennell and Petraglia, 2012; cf.
Mellars et al., 2013a). The contention that these assemblages were
produced by anatomically modern humans is also plausible, but not
well supported empirically. Archaic human populations are known
to have produced similar industries at the same time elsewhere
(e.g. Shea, 2003).
Advocates of the EDM favor the much slower mutation rate
reported by Scally and Durbin (2012) and the extended time scale
for AMH dispersal it implies. They also point to nuclear DNA data
indicating that lineages ancestral to Sahul populations separated
at an early date from those leading to European and E Asian
groups. Pre-60 ka colonization of Sahul is seen by some to be
implied (e.g. Ghirotto et al., 2011; Reyes-Centano et al., 2014).
However, other autosomal studies, while emphasizing a complex,
multi-migration scenario for E Asia and Sahul (McEvoy et al.,
2011; Rasmussen et al., 2011), still date the initial post-L3 divergence events to 70e60 ka, inconsistent with an EDM. The recent
analysis of ancient AMH remains from Europe and E Asia (Fu et al.,
2014) also challenges the “slow” model as it pertains to nuclear
elements of the genome. Debate about mutation rates nevertheless continues (Segural et al., 2014). Even if an early separation of
ancestral Sahul from European and E Asian lineages is conﬁrmed,
as it might well be (Fu et al., 2013a), its precise date remains
uncertain and nothing about the timing of Sahul colonization
necessarily follows.
Although the case for one or more AMH dispersals beyond SW
Asia 120e70 ka is far from established, we do not necessarily discount the idea. The questions addressed here are whether the Sahul
archaeological record supports it, and if it does whether that
somehow falsiﬁes a 50 ka dispersal event and its role in Sahul
colonization. We think the answer to both questions is no. The LDM
is increasingly well warranted on genetic, fossil and archaeological
grounds; Sahul archaeological and mtDNA data provide strong
evidence for it. There may have been earlier dispersals across S Asia,
one or more of which reached Sahul. Conﬁrmation of a pre-50 ka
presence at Madjedbebe would help make that case. But in the

absence of more compelling evidence than is available at present,
we are skeptical about these possibilities.
Dedicated search in the 25 years since the early dates from
Madjedbebe were ﬁrst reported has yet to produce a similar,
analytically veriﬁed ﬁnding from another site, a situation that can
no longer be attributed to the methodological limits of radiocarbon
dating. If a 50e60 ka date for Madjedbebe were conﬁrmed, it would
be as we said a deﬁnite outlier, separated by up to 13,000 years
from the next earliest indication of human presence in Sahul. The
notion that it marked the start of continuous, continental-scale
occupation by anatomically modern humans, or for that matter
by an archaic human population, would be difﬁcult to credit (cf.
Cooper and Stringer, 2013). Any relationship with the populations
that arrived after 48 ka, the likely ancestors of most of the Sahul
indigenes encountered at European contact, would have been
limited at best.
5.4. Looking ahead
Several issues involving chronology will continue to be important going forward. First, while it seems increasingly likely that
ancestors of modern Sahul indigenes ﬁrst arrived on the continent
ca. 47 ka, the possibility of an earlier human presence cannot be
completely dismissed. Archeological evidence on chronology and
genomic data on the identities of the populations involved will
require careful, comprehensive evaluation. Greater crossdisciplinary collaboration with geneticists will be crucial. Similarly, while the complexity of Late Pleistocene Sahul climate change
and its impact on habitat and human populations is increasingly
apparent, the details of those changes and their chronologies must
be understood with much greater precision at regional scales than
is currently the case. Close interaction on the part of archaeologists
and earth scientists will be essential here. Finally, more effort must
be directed at integrating information on the human colonization
of Sahul with the broader picture of human experience across the
Eastern Hemisphere in the Late Pleistocene. Geneticists are
providing important insights on this issue, but archaeologists must
continue to be seriously engaged. The key question about what
causes and facilitates the one or more ex-African expansions must
also be more seriously engaged, preferably in potentially testable
form.
