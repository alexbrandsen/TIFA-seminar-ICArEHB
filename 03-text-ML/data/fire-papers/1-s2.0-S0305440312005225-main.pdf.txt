Diepkloof Rock Shelter offers an exceptional opportunity to study the onset and evolution of both Still
Bay (SB) and Howiesons Poort (HP) techno-complexes. However, previous age estimates based on
luminescence dating of burnt quartzites (Tribolo et al., 2009) and of sediments (Jacobs et al., 2008) were
not in agreement. Here, we present new luminescence ages for 17 rock samples (equivalent dose estimated with a SAR-ITL protocol instead of classical MAAD-TL) as well as for 5 sediment samples
(equivalent dose estimated with SAR-single grain OSL protocol) and an update of the 22 previous age
estimates for burnt lithics (modiﬁed calibration and beta dose estimates). While a good agreement
between the rock and sediment ages is obtained, these estimates are still signiﬁcantly older than those
reported by Jacobs et al. (2008). After our own analyses of the sediment from Diepkloof, it is suspected
that these authors did not correctly chose the parameters for the equivalent dose determination, leading
to an underestimate of the equivalent doses, and thus of the ages.
From bottom to top, the mean ages are 100  10 ka for stratigraphic unit (SU) Noël and 107  11 ka for
SU Mark (uncharacterized Lower MSA), 100  10 ka for SU Lynn-Leo (Pre-SB type Lynn), 109  10 ka for
SUs Kim-Larry (SB), 105  10 ka for SUs Kerry-Kate and 109  10 ka for SU Jess (Early HP), 89  8 ka for
SU Jude (MSA type Jack), 77  8 ka for SU John, 85  9 ka for SU Fox, 83  8 ka for SU Fred and 65  8 ka
for SU OB5 (Intermediate HP), 52  5 ka for SUs OB2-4 (Late HP).
This chronology, together with the technological analyses, greatly modiﬁes the current chrono-cultural
model regarding the SB and the HP and has important archaeological implications. Indeed, SB and HP no
longer appear as short-lived techno-complexes with synchronous appearances for each and restricted to
Oxygen Isotopic Stage (OIS) 4 across South Africa, as suggested by Jacobs et al. (2008, 2012). Rather, the
sequence of Diepkloof supports a long chronology model with an early appearance of both SB and HP in
the ﬁrst half of OIS 5 and a long duration of the HP into OIS 3. These new dates imply that different
technological traditions coexisted during OIS 5 and 4 in southern Africa and that SB and HP can no longer
be considered as horizon markers.

1. Introduction
Diepkloof Rock Shelter is important for the study of the Middle
Stone Age in South Africa for several reasons. The 3.1 m thick
sequence which includes both Still Bay (SB) and Howiesons Poort
(HP) allows for a reﬁned investigation of the succession and
evolution of these techno-complexes that has not been possible in

other sites up to now. The collection of engraved ostrich egg shells
presently has no equivalent and, together with the numerous ochre
fragments and pens, fuels the debate about the origin of modern
symbolically-mediated behaviors. The site also exhibits exceptional
preservation of organic material, such as seeds, ﬂowers and twigs,
thereby providing great opportunity for environmental research
(Rigaud et al., 2006; Texier et al., 2010; Cartwright, 2013; Dayet
et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2013; Texier et al., 2013). For such an
important site, an accurate chronology is essential.
In addition to radiocarbon dates obtained for the top of the
sequence (Parkington and Poggenpoel, 1987; Parkington, 1990;
Tribolo, 2003), several researchers have undertaken luminescence
dating studies at Diepkloof. The ﬁrst OSL study was performed on
sediments by Feathers and Woodborne in the 90’s, but the results
remain unpublished. In the beginning of the 2000’s we conducted
the ﬁrst attempts of TL dating of burnt quartzites and silcretes at
the site (Tribolo, 2003; Tribolo et al., 2005a,b). Both of these initial
studies only dealt with the top of the sequence. In 2008 optical
single grain dating of 12 sediments samples from Lower MSA, SB,
HP and post-HP levels were presented by Jacobs et al. (2008).
These ages were in agreement with numerous chronometric data
obtained by Jacobs et al. (2008, 2012) for HP and SB at sites across
southern Africa. All together, these data supported a short chronological model: “[HP] (which is of sufﬁciently short duration that
it represents a marker horizon of about 62 ka for southern Africa),
the probable brief duration of the SB and the existence of an age
gap of several millennia between SB and HP” (Jacobs et al., 2008, p
735).
In 2009 Tribolo et al. (2009) published 17 additional results
obtained from burnt lithics coming from the HP and SB levels of
Diepkloof. The ages from these samples strongly contrasted with
the sediment ages obtained by Jacobs et al. (2008), with the TL
results consistently 10e50 ka older than the OSL ages. One of our
major goals, then, was to resolve this discrepancy and to reﬁne
and complete the chronological sequence at Diepkloof. Here, we
present the results of the study of 18 additional rock samples as
well as 8 sediment samples and discuss the possible reasons
explaining the discrepancy in dating results. Consequently, we
propose a new chronological model for the SB and the HP that
changes our current understanding of the evolutionary process of
the southern African MSA societies.
2. Site and samples
2.1. Introduction to the Diepkloof sequence
Diepkloof is located in the Sandveld, about 180 km north of Cape
Town and 14 km from the Atlantic Ocean (Parkington et al., 2013).
The shelter, about 25 m wide and 15 m deep was formed in
a residual quartzitic butte, 120 m above the southern shore of the
Verlorenvlei river (Fig. 1).
The LSA layers and a sounding in the top of the MSA layers were
dug by J. Parkington and colleagues during the 1970s and another
pit was dug in the MSA layers in 1986. A new research program was
initiated at the end of the 1990s involving both the universities of
Cape Town and Bordeaux. The extension of the previous test pits
and the digging of connecting trenches led to the deﬁnition of three
sectors of excavation (the Back sector, the Main sector, and the
Trench) (Fig. 1). The deposits were subdivided into stratigraphic
units (SU) in the ﬁeld. According to Parkington et al. (2013) “an SU
comprises a main sedimentary event that could be traced over
a large surface but may include shorter sedimentary episodes that
have not been individually named during the ﬁeldwork”. The SUs
were named following the conventions used during the original
test pit excavations: either human names in the Trench and Main

Sectors (following the alphabetical order of the ﬁrst letter (e.g.
Mike, Lynn etc.), or sedimentary descriptions in the Back Sector
(e.g. orangeeblack complex).
The current excavations uncovered a 3.1 m-deep MSA sequence
which has been excavated over a surface of 3 m2 in the Main Sector
(Fig. 1). In this sector, 53 SUs were deﬁned. Geoarchaeological
investigations at Diepkloof (Miller et al., 2013) have grouped these
SUs into 4 lithostratigraphic units (LUs). In addition 9 technological
phases have been recognized throughout the sequence (Porraz
et al., 2013a). The lower most lithostratigraphic unit (LU1)
comprises SUs Nel to Mary and mainly consists of geogenic deposits
formed by wall disaggregation and aeolian input, although a few
combustion features are documented. The second lithostratigraphic unit (LU2) groups SUs Noah to Joy and documents an
increase in anthropogenic input, notably in the form of hearths. The
following lithostratigraphic unit (LU3) comprises SUs Jeff and John
and forms a distinct break in the types of deposits found in the DRS
sequence. LU3 is characterized by the absence of combustion
features and the dominance of authigenic minerals. The last lithostratigraphic unit (LU4) comprises SUs Governor to Claude and
marks a dramatic shift in the types of anthropogenic deposits,
exhibiting beds, lenses and laminations related to combustion
activities. No major break in the sedimentation is observed
throughout the deposits, except at the MSA/LSA interface.
The lithic assemblages of the base of the deposits (SUs Nel to
Mark) are not yet characterized and are temporally assigned to an
undeﬁned Lower MSA. The following SUs Mike and Lauren have
been assigned to the MSA of type Mike, characterized by the
exploitation of local rocks and the production of triangular ﬂakes,
ﬂakes and blades. The SU Lynn has been assigned to the Pre-SB
(type Lynn) and marks a change in the raw material provisioning strategies as well as in the tool manufacture. The SUs Leo
to Keeno correspond to the bifacial SB (type Larry). The SUs Keegan to Jess are assigned to the Early HP, represented by the
selection of ﬁne-grained rocks, the production of blades, the
manufacture of truncated pieces as well as rare bifacial pieces. The
overlying SUs Jude and Jack introduce a technological break,
though backed pieces (some of them retouched into scrapers) are
documented. The SUs Joy to Fred deﬁne the Intermediate HP,
notably characterized by the presence of strangulated-notched
tools, while the SUs Frank to Debbie deﬁne the Late HP with the
dominance of backed pieces. At the top of the sequence of the
Main Sector, the SUs Debbie to Claude deﬁne the post-HP (type
Claude), characterized by the production of different types of
blanks and the manufacture of ‘unifacial’ points. The technological
succession throughout the sequence supports a scenario of
continuous change, although at different tempos and under
different circumstances (Porraz et al., 2013a,b).
2.2. Rock and sediment samples for luminescence dating
For the dating of burnt lithics, 153 stone samples, mainly nonﬂaked quartzite fragments and a few silcrete fragments, were
selected from the ﬁeld and tested in the laboratory, of which 65
were suitable for luminescence dating. The results for 22 samples
have already been presented in Tribolo et al. (2009). 18 additional
burned quartzite fragments are presented here. They come from
SUs Fred (DRS 175, 176, 177, 178, 180, 181, 182) and Fox (DRS 162, 167,
169, 170), both associated with the Intermediate HP, SU Larry (DRS
34,35, 42, 43, 46) associated with Still Bay artefacts (SB), and SU
Mark (DRS 146 and 149) below the MSA of type Mike (Fig. 1a and b).
They all come from squares M7, N7, L6 and M6 from the Main Sector
(Parkington et al., 2013).
Eight sediment samples were taken at night from the same
trench as the stone samples during the 2010 ﬁeld season: DRS-OSL

3. Rock samples
3.1. Equivalent dose determination
The selected rock samples were sawed and crushed as described
in Tribolo et al., (2009) in order to produce powder made of grains
whose size was artiﬁcially chosen to be between 100 and 160 mm.
Thermoluminescence (TL) measurements were performed with
a Risø TL/OSL-DA 15 reader, equipped with a photomultiplier tube
Q9235, preceded by a BG39 ﬁlter for detection in the blue wave
range [330e480 nm], and a 90Sr/90Y beta source which was calibrated using some of the quartzite samples from Diepkloof. While

the equivalent doses (De) for the former set of samples had been
determined with a multiple aliquot additive and regenerative dose
protocol with standard TL measurements (MAAD-TL), a single
aliquot regenerative protocol, associated with isothermal TL
measurements (SAR-ITL), has been applied here (see Inline
Supplementary Fig. S1 and Fig. 2). The general efﬁciency of this
SAR-ITL protocol has been established independently (Tribolo and
Mercier, 2012). However, dose recovery tests were performed on
each sample. The samples were heated for 90 min at 450  C1 and

This temperature is what is indicated by the thermocouple of the oven. The
actual temperature within the sample, measured with a thermocouple in contact
with the quartz powder, is somewhat different: rapid increase from 20 to 200  C in
<5 min, 340  C reached by 30 min, 390  C reached by 1 h 00 min and 400  C by 1 h
30 min.

doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2012.12.001.
The De of the former set of samples, obtained with a standard
MAAD-TL protocol, are also indicated. As the calibration of the
source has been revised, the values are slightly higher (5%) than
those published in Tribolo et al. (2009).
3.2. Internal (beta and alpha) dose rate

Fig. 2. SAR-ITL protocol after Tribolo and Mercier (2012) for the De determination of
the quartzite samples. The duration of each ITL measurement was 500 s. The ﬁrst 20
and last 50 s were used for signal and background respectively. The sensitivity corrected Lx/Tx signal allows plotting a growth curve on which the natural Ln/Tn signal can
be projected in order to calculate the equivalent dose. Measurements were analyzed
using Analyst (v3.24) (Duller, 2007).

given a beta dose close to the roughly estimated De. The SAR-ITL
measurements were then performed (preheat and ITL measurement done at 320  C). The ratios of expected to recovered dose are
shown on Fig. 3. These ratios are consistent with unity at one sigma
for 12 out of 18 samples and at two sigma for the others.
Inline Supplementary Fig. S1 can be found online at http://dx.
doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2012.12.001.
When estimating the De with a MAAD-TL protocol, it is expected that the De is independent of the temperature on the
interval corresponding to the stable peak (typically the 375  C
peak), showing that the sample has been properly heated before
burial (plateau test). The same expectation can be made with the
SAR-ITL protocol (Tribolo and Mercier, 2012). Therefore, for the De
determination, the preheat and ITL temperatures were varied
between 280 and 360  C (see Inline Supplementary Fig. S2). For
most samples, all De were found within 3 sigma of their mean,
with no signiﬁcant trend and this mean and associated uncertainty have been used for the ﬁnal age calculations. For DRS 162
and DRS 169, the De values start to signiﬁcantly increase from 360
or 340  C respectively (i.e. >3 sigma from the mean). These data
were then discarded. For DRS 175 and 177, the De values obtained
at 280  C and 340  C respectively are signiﬁcantly lower than for
the other temperatures and they were not integrated into the ﬁnal
mean De. For DRS 35, no plateau was found and it is likely that
this sample, despite the satisfactory dose recovery test, does not
properly behave with the SAR-ITL protocol. This sample has thus
been discarded. The De are indicated on Table 3 with their
statistical error.

The internal dose rate due to alpha and beta particles depends
on the radioactive contents (238U, 235U and 232Th series and 40K)
within the stone, as well as on the distribution of these radioisotopes. For each sample, a piece of rock was crushed and the
homogenized powder was analyzed using either Neutron Activation or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)
(Table 1). These analyses allow us to determine the averaged U, Th
and K contents but they give no indication on the location of these
radio-isotopes and consequently, on their distribution. Generally, it
is assumed that quartz grains, almost free of radioisotopes, are
embedded in a homogeneous radioactive matrix (what is called the
“pottery model”), and in our previous work, the quartzites were
assimilated to potteries: the beta and alpha doses were computed
according to the size of the quartz grains, taking into account
attenuation factors (Mejdahl, 1979; Brennan et al., 1991).
Proceeding this way, we did, however, underestimate the
effective dose absorbed by quartz grains. Quartzites are actually
almost exclusively made of quartz grains and the observation of
thin sections indicates that the space between these grains is
typically less than a few microns (Tribolo et al., 2006, 2009). This
distance is then signiﬁcantly lower than the range of the beta
particles (emitted by natural radio-isotopes) which can reach up to
2 mm in siliceous materials. Consequently, the energy carried by
the beta particles emitted in the grain joints is almost entirely
absorbed by quartz grains and not deposited in other materials (air,
water, other minerals as it can be the case for potteries or sediments). Therefore, in the present case, the attenuation factors have
to be set to zero whatever the distribution of grain size (this is
further discussed in Inline Supplementary Fig. S3). For the alpha
dose, however, attenuation factors depending on the size distribution should still be considered since the grains are much larger
(typically between 200 and 1000 mm) than the range of alpha
particles (max. 20 mm).
Inline Supplementary Fig. S3 can be found online at http://dx.
doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2012.12.001.
The calculated beta and alpha dose rates are plotted on Table 1
for the new set of rock samples, as well as for the 22 samples of the
former set. Note also that the alpha and beta dose rate conversion
factors have been updated for this calculation, following Guérin
et al. (2011).

Fig. 3. Dose recovery ratio for each rock sample (one aliquot per sample). Sample
numbers are indicated above the corresponding symbol.

The sediment samples were prepared in a standard way in order
to extract the 200e250 mm fraction of quartz grains: wet sieving,
successive chemical attacks with HCl (10%), H2O2 (30%), heavy
liquid separation (density within 2.72 and 2.58) and HF (48%) attack
for 60 min, with a ﬁnal HCl (10%) bath, H2O rinse and dry sieving
(160 mm). Contamination by remaining feldspar grains was
systematically checked with IRSL tests (Duller, 2003).
Measurements were performed with a Risø TL/OSL-DA 15 reader
equipped with a 10 mW Nd:YVO4 diode-pumped laser (532 nm)
for single grain excitation (Duller et al., 1999; Bøtter-Jensen et al.,
2000, 2003), and with a Q9235 Photomultiplier tube preceded by

alpha sensitivities (S-alpha, Valladas and Valladas, 1982) were measured for most samples but show few variations. For the remaining samples a mean value was used.

7.5 mm of Hoya U340 ﬁlter for detection in the UV range (280e
380 nm). Irradiations were performed with a 90Sr/90Y beta source
delivering 0.16 Gy/s to the 200e250 mm quartz grains located in the
single grain discs. The beta source calibration was performed by
using some of the sediment samples from Diepkloof.
A Single Aliquot and Regenerative dose protocol was applied
(Murray and Wintle, 2000; Wintle and Murray, 2006) (Fig. 4). A
basic requirement of any SAR protocol is that it allows for the
recovery of a known laboratory-delivered dose (e.g. Murray and
Wintle, 2003). Dose recovery tests were thus performed for each
sample, after bleaching at room temperature in a solar simulator, in
order to test the efﬁciency of the protocol. The preheat of the
natural and regenerative dose was ﬁxed at 260  C for 10 s, and
different conditions for the preheat of the test dose and for the
optical cleaning at the end of each cycle were tested. 300 grains
were measured for each set of tested parameters. Dose recovery
ratios, as well as the number of acceptable grains (standard rejection criteria), were used and the observed over-dispersions are
plotted on Table 2. In many cases, the estimated dose was found to
be signiﬁcantly lower than the delivered dose. Acceptable dose
recovery ratios (within 5% of unity) were obtained for the following
test dose preheat and optical cleaning: 220  C for 5 s/optical
cleaning at 280  C for 40 s was found satisfying for DRS-OSL 7 and
8; for the other samples, an optical cleaning at 125  C for 60 s was
found more appropriate, with test dose preheat of 160  C for 0 s

(cut-heat) for DRS-OSL 4 and 5, 160  C for 10 s for DRS-OSL 1 and 2
(though the statistics for this last sample are poor and more data
are needed for conﬁrmation) and 220  C for 5 s, for DRS-OSL 6.
These conditions of test dose preheat and optical cleaning have
thus been used for the equivalent dose (De) determinations of

Fig. 4. SAR protocol for the De determination of the sediment samples. The parameters
for preheat and optical cleaning (last step) were determined after dose recovery tests.
A seventh cycle with IRSL measurement between the regenerative irradiation and the
OSL measurement was performed for detection of feldspar grains (Duller, 2003).
Measurements were analyzed using Analyst (v3.24) (Duller, 2007). The ﬁrst 0.12 s and
last 0.16 s were used for signal and background respectively.

samples DRS-OSL 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8. The study of DRS-OSL 2, 3, and 5
has not yet been pursued.
The recovery of a laboratory-delivered dose is a necessary but
not sufﬁcient condition for a SAR protocol. It has been shown, for
example, that dose recovery ratios can be consistent with unity for
a range of preheat temperatures of the regenerative doses while the
De value can be signiﬁcantly dependant on this temperature
(Roberts, 2006). Therefore, for the De measurements, different
preheats of the natural or regenerative doses (260, 280, and 240 or
300  C for 10 s each) were tested. 200e600 grains were examined
for each set of parameters. For DRS-OSL 4, a plateau at 240e300  C
was observed, while data obtained at 240  C (DRS-OSL 8) or 300  C
(DRS-OSL 1 and 6) were discarded from the ﬁnal De calculation. The
distributions of the selected grains are plotted on Inline Supplementary Fig. S4. The over-dispersions (od) are between 0.29  0.02
and 0.37  0.04. These values are not inconsistent with well
bleached, undisturbed sediments (see also discussion in Tribolo
et al., 2010 and references therein). Indeed, high od, up to
0.22  0.04 were obtained for the bleached and beta-dosed
samples during the dose recovery measurements (Table 2), which
is consistent with what Thomsen et al. (2012) observed for other
samples. Therefore the measurements themselves and microdosimetry could be responsible alone for the dispersion. The role of
microdosimetry should be further tested following micromorphological analyses and modeling (study under way). Meanwhile,
a central age model (Galbraith et al., 1999) was employed for the
ﬁnal De estimate (Table 3).

Results for the dose recovery tests performed on each sediment sample. The preheat of the regenerative doses was ﬁxed at 260  C for 10 s while the parameters for the optical cleaning (last step of each cycle, see Fig. 4) and the
preheat parameters (x2, T2) for the test dose were varied. “n” stands for the number of accepted grains (300 measured except where otherwise stated), the ratio of measured to given dose is indicated in bold while “od” stands for
the over-dispersion. a and b: In these cases, the analyses of synthetic aliquot gave ratio of 0.99  0.08 and 0.99  0.06 respectively.

High resolution gamma spectrometry was performed on each
sediment sample in order to determine the mean U, Th and K
contents and to examine the equilibrium state of the U chain (Inline
Supplementary Table S1). For DRS-OSL 1, 6, 7 and 8, the ratio of the
activities for the top, middle and bottom of the chain are all
consistent at two sigma (three sigma for DRS-OSL 6). Disequilibrium can be observed, however, for the other samples and
comments similar to those published in Tribolo et al. (2009) apply.
For DRS-OSL 4 in particular, the activities for the top and bottom of
the chain appear in excess (44 and 32% respectively) compared to
the middle of the chain. U contributes to about 19e26% of the total
dose rate for this sample and the dose rates calculated following
different scenarios of evolution of the U chain are within 7% of
the dose rate calculated with the current activities. Therefore, this
is well within the error margin and the current activities have
been used for the calculation of the ﬁnal age estimate.
Inline Supplementary Table S1 can be found online at http://dx.
doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2012.12.001.
The beta dose rate was calculated in the standard way from the
mean U, Th and K contents, using the attenuation factor taking into
account the granulometry of the receptor only and not the geometry of its environment (Guérin et al., 2012). No systematic
measurements for moisture content were performed, but it can be
assumed, based on the preservation of organic material and of
soluble salts, that the current dryness at the site also prevailed in
the past. Micromorphological analyses suggest that moisture most
likely came from fog or dew and was largely concentrated at the
surfaces of the deposits (Miller et al., 2013). Therefore, a 5  2%
water content (i.e. 0e11% interval at 3 sigma) was used for the
calculations.
The HF attack applied to the quartz grains was assumed to have
completely removed the external layer of the grains irradiated by
alpha particles. The internal alpha dose rate was considered

Table 3
Main data for the age calculations. The samples are sorted by SU, from top to bottom. Sediment samples are highlighted with grey. The uncertainties are statistical but for the ages where the systematic uncertainties are taken into
account. Right to the internal dose rate, the ratio of internal (or beta for sediments) to the total dose rate is indicated.

negligible in comparison to the total dose rate to which the quartz
grains were submitted.
5. Gamma and cosmic dose rate
The gamma dose rate for the rock and sediment samples were
both determined from in situ dosimetry. Results for 27 CaSO4:Dy
dosimeters have already been presented in Tribolo et al. (2009).
Since then, 42 more data points from Al2O3:C dosimeters (either
powder or chips) have been obtained. All of the measured gamma
dose rates are plotted on Fig. 5. The new results underline the
dependence of the dose to the location: doses are highly variable in
the top of the sequence (from 0.499  0.007 to 0.856  0.039 Gy/
ka) in OPQ sector and more homogeneous in the Main Sector
(squares L, M, N) with doses between 0.537  0.002 and
0.756  0.003 Gy/ka above z ¼ 172 cm and between 0.416  0.128
to 0.568  0.019 Gy/Ka below. This change in function of depth in
the Main Sector seems to ﬁt with the change of sedimentation
observed above SU Jeff (Miller et al., 2013).
The cosmic dose rate was calculated from the estimated thickness of the roof, after Prescott and Hutton (1994) and was thus
estimated 0.02  0.01 Gy/ka. The excavated area is far enough
behind the dripline and partly hidden by a large boulder at the
entrance, so that the portion of cosmic radiation arriving unattenuated from the shelter opening is likely negligible. The estimate of
cosmic dose rate was used for correcting the dose recorded by the
artiﬁcial dosimeters. As the current water content was assumed to
be equivalent to the one experienced by the samples during burial,
no further correction was done on the gamma doses.
6. Ages and discussion
6.1. Ages
Table 3 summarizes the data necessary for the calculation of the
ages for the 17 new rock samples and the 5 sediment samples. Since
the beta dose rate calculation has been modiﬁed and the alpha and
beta dose rate conversion factors have been revised, the updated
values for dose rates and ages have also been indicated for the 22
previous rock samples. The whole ages are plotted on Inline
Supplementary Fig. S5 in function of their depth. The two sets of

symbols are used to distinguish between the different sectors where the dosimeters
were located.

rock ages give consistent results, though the equivalent doses were
obtained with different protocols. The rock ages are also consistent
with the sediment ages. A Dixon test was applied to each SU for the
rock samples. None of the ages appears as a signiﬁcant outlier and
all have been included in the calculation of weighted mean ages for
each SU (see Inline Supplementary Fig. S5).
Inline Supplementary Fig. S5 can be found online at http://dx.
doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2012.12.001.
The weighted mean ages are indicated in the last column of
Table 3 and are plotted as function of depth in Fig. 6. They are, from
bottom to top, 100  10 ka for SU Noël and 107  11 ka for SU Mark
(uncharacterized Lower MSA), 100  10 ka for SU Lynn-Leo (Pre-SB
type Lynn), 109  10 ka for SUs Kim-Larry (SB), 105  10 ka for SUs
Kerry-Kate and 109  10 ka for SU Jess (Early HP), 89  8 ka for SU
Jude (MSA-Jack), 77  8 ka for SU John, 86  9 ka for SU Fox
(combining rock and sediment estimates), 83  8 ka for SU Fred and
65  8 ka for SU OB5 (Intermediate HP), 52  5 ka for SUs OB2-4
(Late HP). There is no signiﬁcant stratigraphic inversion. The ages
obtained by Jacobs et al. (2008) have also been added for comparison. Except for the Late HP, their ages are signiﬁcantly younger
(15e35% lower) than those presented here.
6.2. Discussing the data of Jacobs et al. (2008)
There are several reasons why we suspect that the ages reported
by Jacobs et al. (2008) for the Intermediate HP and below are
underestimates. Although they used a Finite Mixture Model (FMM,
Galbraith and Green, 1990, 1993) and extracted the equivalent dose
with the highest De (main component), they calculated an “aboveaverage” beta-dose. This is based on the assumption that some of
the grains were located in a matrix of poorly radioactive material.
However, this assumption is not supported by any micromorphological analyses and multiple components in the De distributions
can occur with the FMM even in homogeneous, well bleach and
undisturbed sediments (Guérin et al., 2012). Meanwhile, the
question is whether the shielding of grains by materials with low
radioactivity might have decrease the calculated ages. To answer
this question, we recalculated the doses in a standard way, using
the data from Jacobs et al. (2008) for U, Th and K contents,2 and the
ages (still using the main component of the FMM since the central
ages were not available). The recalculated ages were within 10% of
the previous estimate (16% higher for one sample of the Late HP),
showing that this process is not responsible alone for the
discrepancy.
For the De determination, Jacobs et al. (2008) performed their
dose recovery tests on multi-grain samples. From our single grain
measurements, synthetic aliquots of 100 grains were analyzed. We
encountered two cases where the dose recovery ratio was acceptable for the synthetic aliquots but was not for the single grain
analysis, demonstrating that the dose recovery test must be conducted exactly in the same conditions as the ﬁnal De measurements
(Table 2).
Most importantly, it can be noticed that Jacobs et al. (2008)
performed their dose recovery experiment on only 3 samples out
of 12. Moreover, they used the same set of parameters for the De
determination of every sample (260  C for 10 s/220  C for 5 s
preheat with a 280  C for 40 s optical cleaning between cycles). Our
tests performed on each sample clearly show that the acceptable
parameters is speciﬁc to each sample: only the top samples (DRSOSL 7 and 8) support a 260  C for 10 s/220  C for 5 s preheat with
a 280  C for 40 s optical cleaning between cycles. For the remaining
samples, this set of parameters clearly leads to a ca. 10e20%

The data were not available for the three deepest samples.

Fig. 6. Mean rock ages estimates (white diamonds) and sediment ages estimates
(white squares) as function of depth. Sediment ages from Jacobs et al. (2008) (black
triangles) have been plotted for comparison (though the depths of the top six samples
have been adjusted to take the slope into account, as they come from the C6 square
and not from the L-M-N ones). The main cultural attributions are indicated. The d18O
curve, deﬁning the Oxygen Isotopic Stages (OIS) has also been added for guidance since
OIS are commonly used for discussing prehistoric models (after Martinson et al., 1987).
However, care must be done not to use it for direct association with a global climatic
model, since the southern African climate system has been shown to be very different
from the global one (Chase, 2010).

underestimate. It is therefore possible that the SAR parameters
applied by Jacobs et al. (2008) were not appropriate for their
samples in the deepest SUs, namely John (Intermediate HP), Kerry
(Early HP) and Logan (SB) and that the equivalent doses, and
therefore ages, were underestimated by 10% or more.
6.3. Archaeological implications
Establishing the chronology of the HP has a long scientiﬁc history
that has been discussed in several papers (e.g. Lombard, 2005;
Tribolo et al., 2006). While early radiocarbon results were questioned
and other radiometric methods were not yet available, palaeoenvironmental data were used to propose ages, based on comparisons with the global climatic system. This, however, did not lead to
any consensus and the principle as a whole has long been criticized
(e.g. Parkington,1990; Chase, 2010). However, based on stratigraphic
observations only, the HP was considered a horizon marker (e.g.
Deacon and Schuurman, 1992), meaning that it was a technological
manifestation extremely brief in time and homogeneous across
space. The ﬁrst radiometric and chemical dating methods (Luminescence, Electron Spin Resonance, UraniumeThorium and Amino
Acid Racemisation) applied at a hand full of sites (Klasies River,
Boomplaas, Rose Cottage, Border Cave and Apollo 11) did not
contradict this view, as the data set, despite some dispersion, was
restricted to OIS 4 and the beginning of OIS 3 (Feathers, 2002; Grün
and Beaumont, 2001; Millard, 2006; Miller and Beaumont, 1989;
Miller et al., 1999; Tribolo et al., 2006; Vogel, 2000).

3409

As for the SB, discussions have not been as extensive as for the
HP since it was found in a very limited number of sites, and the ﬁrst
chronometric data obtained at Blombos Cave by three different
dating methods were in agreement (e.g. Tribolo et al., 2006). Based
on these data, the SB, like the HP, was assumed to be a horizon
marker.
This view of SB and HP chronology was fully assessed by Jacobs
et al. (2008, 2012) who presented luminescence ages for SB and HP
assemblages across southern Africa, with an unusual precision.
They argued that the SB and HP could be considered horizon
markers, since they were both of short duration and restricted only
to OIS 4. Moreover, the data from Jacobs et al. (2008) suggested
a gap of several millennia between the SB and HP.
However, even without any further age estimate, the technological analyses performed at Diepkloof undermine this model
(Porraz et al., 2013a,b). Indeed, the samples from SUs Kerry-Kate
have been wrongly attributed to the SB in Jacobs et al. (2008)
(70.9  2.3 ka) and Tribolo et al. (2009), while they actually fully
belong to the HP. The wrong cultural assignment of these layers was
due to the discovery of a few bifacial implements within the
overlying SUs Jess and Kate, when the sequence was at a preliminary phase of exploration. This cultural revision seriously undermines the hypothesis of a gap between the SB and the HP.
Moreover, preliminary comparisons between the HP assemblage at
Diepkloof and HP assemblages in eastern sites suggests that the
Early HP and part of the Intermediate HP remain, for now, only
observed at Diepkloof (see Porraz et al., 2013a). This suggests that
the earliest part of the HP is missing in most of the southern African
sites (Porraz et al., 2013b).
The new chronological results obtained at Diepkloof on both
sediments and burnt lithics support the technological assessment
(Porraz et al., 2013a) and contribute to a signiﬁcant change of view
on the SB and HP chronology: the SB at Diepkloof (109  10 ka)
appears signiﬁcantly older than at Blombos (74  3 ka emean OSL
age; 72  7 ka emean TL age3; 62  6 or 80  6 ka-ESR, depending
on the U-uptake model) and Sibudu (70.5  2.4 ka-OSL age) (see
Jacobs et al., 2008, 2012 for references); only the Late HP (52  5 ka)
and end of the Intermediate HP (65  8 ka) at Diepkloof seem to be
contemporaneous with the HP at Klasies River, Rose Cottage,
Boomplaas, Border Cave, Apollo 11 and other sites cited in Jacobs
et al. (2008). The TL and OSL data from Diepkloof therefore
suggests that: 1) the SB and HP appeared as early as during the ﬁrst
half of OIS 5, 2) the HP lasted for about 50 thousand years, and likely
ended well after the start of OIS 3, 3) different technological traditions coexisted in southern Africa during OIS 5 and 4, 4) the SB and

7. Conclusion
After the reassessment of the beta dose rate and calibration of
the source for quartzites and the dating study of new samples,
a consistent chronology, made of 39 burnt lithics ages and 5 single
grain-based sediment ages, was obtained for the sequence at Diepkloof. A Bayesian analysis that properly takes into account the
systematic errors, is currently being undertaken4 in order to reﬁne

3
As for Diepkloof samples, the dose rates were re-assessed for the burnt lithics
from Klasies River and Blombos previously published. The new ages estimates are
slightly younger but remain consistent with the previous ones (Tribolo et al., 2006):
the mean TL age for the HP at Klasies River is 53  3 ka instead of 56  3 ka and
72  7 ka instead of 75  6 ka for the SB at Blombos cave (Inline Supplementary
Table S2).

the age determinations. This chronology is signiﬁcantly different
from the one proposed by Jacobs et al. (2008), but we argue that
their sediment ages could be underestimated, mainly because the
preheat parameters for the De estimates were inappropriate for the
deepest samples.
Together with the technological analyses, the new data allows
us to propose a model for the chronology of the SB and HP, with an
early appearance of both (ﬁrst half of OIS 5), at least in the Western
Cape, and a long duration of the HP into OIS 3. For about 50
thousand years, the HP coexisted with other techno-complexes in
southern Africa. What was the geographical extent of the ﬁrst
groups developing the HP and what are the forces that drove its
emergence and success? The new chronology from Diepkloof will
hopefully help answer this important issue (Porraz et al., 2013b).
