Recent research in Paleolithic archeology has stressed the importance of temporal issues in assemblage
interpretation. Archeological assemblages are temporal constructs, formed by the addition of an
unknown number of depositional events. This temporal dimension is also evident at the artifactual level,
since single artifacts may undergo different events of modiﬁcation and/or uses over time. The recycling of
previously discarded blanks for tool production is one of the best examples of the temporal nature of
artifacts. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the importance of recycling in a Late Upper Paleolithic site,
examining a type of artifact e burned tools e that has up to now been little used to approach this issue.
Our results suggest that recycling was probably a signiﬁcant component of Upper Paleolithic provisioning
behavior, with important implications in site formation processes and the typological variability of
assemblages. The expedient or curated character of recycling is also discussed.

1. Introduction
Recent developments in Paleolithic research have underscored
the temporal nature of the archeological record. Most Paleolithic
assemblages are palimpsests deﬁned by stratigraphic criteria and
are aggregates made up of remains from an unknown number of
depositional events (Bailey, 2007; Bailey and Galadinou, 2009;
Brochier, 1999; Malinsky-Buller et al., 2011; Vaquero, 2008).
Although the exact duration of such formation processes cannot be
established, it is possible that most Pleistocene assemblages accumulated over the course of hundreds or thousands of years. This
cumulative character has important consequences in interpreting
archeological assemblages, especially when attempting to apply
ethnographically-derived middle-range theories constructed in
high resolution temporal contexts. Events of different natures can
contribute to these palimpsests and assemblages should therefore
not be considered as coherent constructs from a functional,
economical or cultural point of view. Time averaging explanations
of the assemblage as-a-whole may thus be seriously ﬂawed (Crema
et al., 2010; Domínguez-Rodrigo, 2009; Lyman, 2003; Shott, 2008).

The signiﬁcance of the temporal dimension in understanding
archeological assemblages is widely recognized, but there is
another time-related issue that has received comparatively less
attention by archeologists: the temporal nature of single artifacts.
Some artifacts may exhibit complex life histories characterized by
the succession of different use and/or manufacture events. The
meaning of such artifacts may differ through time (Bailey, 2007;
Joy, 2009) and the ﬁnal form, which is the outcome of the successive modiﬁcations, may be very different from that imposed in the
ﬁrst manufacture event. In these cases, artifact morphology should
not be considered as the expression of mental templates imposed
by the artisan, but the unplanned consequence of this sequence of
modiﬁcation events. The relevance of artifact biographies for
interpreting variability in lithic assemblages was clearly pointed
out by Harold L. Dibble (1991, 1995) in his studies on Middle
Paleolithic sidescrapers. According to Dibble, the morphology of
some Mousterian sidescrapers e and therefore their typological
classiﬁcation e was the result of several episodes of resharpening
and use. Some artifacts were more intensely utilized and their
edges were rejuvenated several times, while others were discarded
after short use periods. These different life histories determined the
appearance of different morphotypes, therefore playing a primary
role in assemblage variability. These arguments are less common in
Upper Paleolithic studies. Although resharpening has been used to
explain the size variability of some tool types, like endscrapers

2786

(Movius et al., 1968; Morrow, 1997; Blades, 2003), it is normally
assumed that modiﬁcations through time did not change the
typological classiﬁcation of retouched artifacts.
However, resharpening is not the sole expression of the
temporal nature of lithic artifacts. Recycling is another behavior
that implies successive stages of modiﬁcation and/or use of the
same artifact. Although the archeological consequences of
resharpening and recycling may be difﬁcult to distinguish, they are
different behaviors that can be explained by entirely different
factors. Resharpening is a maintenance procedure aimed at
extending the use life of an artifact. It can be considered an
economic behavior which is especially useful in contexts characterized by a shortage of raw materials, in which it is costly to
discard worn-out artifacts. Unlike resharpening, recycling is
deﬁned by a phase of discard between the different use events. It is
not the extension of the use life of the artifact, but the beginning of
a new use life. Recycling has often been explained as the consequence of raw material scarcity, a way of maximizing the proﬁtability of lithic resources (Kelly, 1988; Dibble and Rolland, 1992;
Close, 1996; Amick, 2007; Galup, 2007; Hiscock, 2009). In this
sense, recycling would be expected in curated technologies and it
has even been considered as one of the main aspects of curation
(Bamforth, 1986). However, it can also appear in expedient
contexts, as a way to quickly meet immediate needs. Therefore,
recycling should not be associated solely with curated contexts.
In spite of its potential signiﬁcance in assemblage formation and
artifact morphology, recycling behavior is particularly difﬁcult to
identify from archeological data. As some researchers point out
(Amick, 2007; Galup, 2007), recycling was probably more common
in prehistoric times than the scarce archeological evidence
suggests. Due to these empirical problems, it has even been suggested that recycling is not a useful concept in archeological
interpretation (Odell, 1996).
Archaeologists have used different kinds of data to identify
recycling. Recycling can be approached by means of artifact movements inferred from spatial distribution and reﬁtting (Vaquero,
2011). In this context, the differential scattering of reduction
sequences can be used to establish temporal relationships between
artifacts. In other cases, the use of a single artifact for different
functions (for example, a cobble ﬁrst used as a hammerstone and
later exploited as a core) has been considered evidence of recycling
(Thiébaut et al., 2010). However, most approaches to recycling are
based on artifact attributes, and especially on surface alterations,
that suggest a period of discard between different activity events.
These alterations can be considered as temporal markers, since they
allow those events previous to the alteration to be distinguished
from those that occurred afterwards. Obsidian hydration is a good
indicator of recycling, since the thickness of hydration rinds depends
on exposure length (Michels, 1969). Identifying rinds of different
thicknesses on the same artifact is therefore an indication of recycling (Amick, 2007). Likewise, patinated ﬂint artifacts are suitable for
inferring recycling. In artifacts showing a double patina, the
secondary modiﬁcations can be clearly differentiated from the older
patinated surface. This has been the criterion most commonly used
for identifying recycling in Paleolithic assemblages (cf. Barkai et al.,
2009: 66; Debenath, 1992: 55; Galili and Weinstein-Evron, 1985:
40; Mora et al., 2004: 428; Nishiaki, 1985: 221e222). Both hydration
bands and patina need considerable time to form and are perhaps
the best criteria for identifying long-term recycling.
Fire damage is another temporal marker that provides clues as
to what happened before and after it, although it has been less
frequently used than hydration and patina in recycling studies. The
effects of thermal alteration on ﬁne-grained rocks has been widely
analyzed in experimental studies and several kinds of macroscopic
modiﬁcations e color changes, potlid fractures, fragmentation, and

crazing e have been identiﬁed (Grifﬁths et al., 1986; Olausson and
Larsson, 1982; Patterson, 1995; Purdy and Brooks, 1971; Sergant
et al., 2006). The intensity of ﬁre damage depends on temperature and exposure time, but experimental studies indicate that heat
damage appears only at around 300  C in artifacts that come into
direct contact with ﬁre (Sergant et al., 2006). Modiﬁcations made
after ﬁre exposure are macroscopically identiﬁable due to the
greasy luster on surfaces ﬂaked subsequent to heat damage. Artifacts with such lustrous ﬂake scars might be interpreted as the
result of recycling, since burned blanks may correspond to previously discarded items that were unintentionally exposed to ﬁre and
later recycled to manufacture tools.
The main analytical problem lies in differentiating between
items burnt after disposal from those intentionally exposed to ﬁre
in order to improve their ﬂaking qualities. This obstacle might
explain why the contribution of burnt artifacts to the discussion on
recycling remains a relatively unexplored line of research. Several
authors have deﬁned the conditions and methods for heat treating
(Crabtree and Butler, 1964; Mandeville, 1973; Grifﬁths et al., 1986;
Domanski et al., 1994; Mercieca and Hiscock, 2008). Heat treatment
improves the knappability of siliceous stones through the removal
of interstitial water. This behavior has been noted in ethnographic
contexts (Hester, 1972) and has been identiﬁed in some Paleolithic
assemblages, particularly in the manufacture of tools that require
relatively high technical skill. For example, the thermal preparation
of ﬂint was used in the manufacture of Solutrean points in Parpalló
Cave (Tiffagom, 2006). However, determining the intentional
nature of this heat treatment is not always straightforward and the
accidental burning of lithics cannot be ruled out in some cases
(Gregg and Grybush, 1976). In addition, thermal treatment seems
superﬂuous for the manufacture of most Upper Paleolithic tools,
which do not require high technical skill and are commonly made
on unburned blanks. In this context, the typological distribution of
tools retouched after ﬁre damage can provide insight into the use of
an intentional heat treatment. If the most skill-demanding tools
show higher indices of post-damage retouch, intentional heat
treatment would be supported.
The aim of this paper is to evaluate the relevance of recycling in
Upper Paleolithic assemblages through the analysis of burned tools
from Molí del Salt, a Late Upper Paleolithic site located in the
northeastern Iberian Peninsula. We will try to establish whether
recycling was a signiﬁcant factor in the formation of the lithic
assemblage. A method for measuring recycling will be proposed for
comparing the importance of this behavior in different assemblages. We will pay special attention to the typological distribution
of post-damage tools in order to ascertain the role of recycling in
the typological variability of assemblages. Typological differences
between post-damage retouched tools and the rest of the tools in
an assemblage may be useful not only in deﬁning the activity
context of recycling, but also in distinguishing recycling from an
intentional heat treatment. Multiple tools are of particular interest,
as they may be the product of either an intentional design or,
alternatively, the addition over time of different tools on the same
blank. A higher index of recycling among multiple tools would
support the temporal nature of these artifacts. Finally, we will
discuss the economic meaning of recycling and its association with
either curated or expedient technical strategies. Due to the
economic implications of recycling, differences throughout the
archeological sequence may also be indicative of temporal changes
in raw material provisioning constraints or settlement patterns.
2. Materials and methods
The Molí del Salt site is located in the village of Vimbodí i Poblet,
35 km northwest of the city of Tarragona (Fig. 1), at 490 m above sea

level on the left bank of the Milans, a small tributary of the Francolí
river. It is a rockshelter in the Tertiary conglomerates (Upper
Oligocene) common along the eastern borders of the Ebro basin.
Archeological excavations begun in 1999 revealed a 2.5 m thick
stratigraphic sequence containing Mesolithic and Late Upper
Paleolithic (Late Magdalenian) layers. The Late Upper Paleolithic
sequence corresponds to the lowermost 1.5 m of the stratigraphy,
a succession of silty and sandy layers with some large conglomerate
blocks, in which two main stratigraphic and archeological units
have been distinguished from top to bottom: unit A, subdivided
into levels Asup, A and A1; and unit B, subdivided into levels B1 and
B2. An Early Holocene Mesolithic layer at the top of the sequence
will not be included in this study. Several 14C/AMS dates have
been obtained for levels Asup and A (Table 1), ranging from
10,840  50 and 11,800  50 14C years BP e from 12,690 to
13,800 cal years BP. Levels B1 and B2 have been dated respectively
to 11,940  100 and 12,510  100 14C years BP e 14,070e13,590 and

15,300e14,540 cal years BP. The upper layers (Asup and A) have
been extensively excavated, but levels A1, B1 and B2 have been
exclusively documented in a 3 m2 test pit. The number of remains
in these levels is therefore much lower than in the uppermost one.
The archeological assemblages from the Molí del Salt site are
characterized by ample evidence of burning. Burned remains are
common in both the lithic and faunal assemblages. This may be
explained by the hearth-focused nature of human occupations, but
the characteristics of the stratigraphic succession also played an
important role. The Paleolithic sequence of this site is a large
palimpsest formed by a 1.5 m thick deposit of sands and silts
without sterile layers. This means that hearths were systematically
constructed over the lithics and bones discarded during previous
occupations. In such a context, post-depositional and unintentional
ﬁre damage would be common.
Flint is overwhelmingly dominant in the lithic assemblages and
it was practically the only raw material used in knapping activities.

Although some tools on limestone and schist have also been
identiﬁed, only ﬂint tools have been considered in this paper. The
technological and typological characteristics are typical of Late
Upper Paleolithic assemblages in Mediterranean Spain. In general,
toolkits are dominated by endscrapers, backed elements (points
and blades) and denticulates, although other types (burins, borers,
abrupts, truncations) are also relatively well represented. However,
there are signiﬁcant differences between the archeological units.
Truncations are particularly common in unit B, where they show
percentage values of around 20%, but they are very scarce in unit A.
Burins show the opposite trend; they are well represented in unit A,
but practically absent in unit B. Endscrapers exhibit their maximum
values in unit A, while in unit B their percentage is similar to that of
truncations. Other types (denticulates, backed artifacts) do not
show signiﬁcant changes throughout the sequence. These changes
are associated with other evolutionary trends in raw material
provisioning (local raw materials increase from bottom to top) and
artifact size (tools tend to get smaller over time).
We have identiﬁed burned tools using the different macroscopic
features described in the literature as evidence of ﬁre damage in
ﬂint artifacts. According to the incidence of burning, four kinds of
artifacts have been distinguished among the retouched implements
recovered at Molí del Salt: a) tools without ﬁre damage; b) tools
retouched before ﬁre damage; c) tools retouched after ﬁre damage;
and d) tools that were retouched both before and after ﬁre damage.
The two latter categories have been identiﬁed through the presence
of retouch scars whose surface is different from the rest of the blank
surface, generally because they display a greasy luster (Fig. 2).
These are the artifacts that can be directly associated with recycling,
since they indicate the modiﬁcation of previously burned blanks.
The artifacts were divided into size categories according to length
and width: very small (<500 mm2), small (500e1000 mm2),
medium (1000e1500 mm2), large (1500e2000 mm2) and very
large (>2000 mm2).
The retouched artifacts were analyzed and classiﬁed in keeping
with the Structural and Analytical Typology of G. Laplace (1972),
although only their adscription to the main typological groups will
be used in this paper. However, we have also included a typological
group that does not appear in Laplace’s typology: retouched blanks.
This group contains artifacts that have been retouched on one side,
but that lack the formalized morphology characteristic of the other
typological groups. We have paid special attention to the distinction between simple tools, i.e. artifacts bearing only one tool type,
and multiple tools, which display evidence of more than one tool
type manufactured on a single blank. It is important to stress that
we have considered one of the types of simple endscrapers deﬁned

by Laplace e the endscraper with lateral retouch e as a multiple
tool, since it is characterized by two retouched sides with different
characteristics.
A Minimum Recycling Index (MRI) was calculated as an estimate
of the signiﬁcance of recycling in tool production. This index
corresponds to the percentage of burned tools that were retouched
after ﬁre damage. This must be considered as a minimum index
because we do not know if some artifacts retouched before burning
were also manufactured from recycled blanks. As for the unburned
tools, we cannot say if the artifacts burned after retouch were
previously recycled or not. We cannot therefore rule out that the
actual number of recycled items is higher than that deduced from
our data. Although it is only an approximation to the real incidence
of recycling, this MRI essentially serves for comparative purposes,
as it allows the differential practice of recycling among different
assemblages to be estimated.
3. Results
We analyzed 1583 retouched artifacts from the Late Upper
Paleolithic layers, 1383 of them corresponding to simple tools and
199 to multiple tools. As shown in Table 2, the artifacts that do not

show macroscopic evidence of ﬁre damage are dominant (62.6%),
although there is a signiﬁcant proportion of burned tools. However,
differences between levels are important and the percentage of
burned artifacts tends to be higher in the levels of unit A. The effects
of sample size cannot be dismissed in the explanation of these
differences, but it is worth pointing out that the percentage of
burned tools in level A1, which is the smallest assemblage, is similar
to that obtained in the other levels of unit A. Natural formation

2789

processes may explain the different proportion of burned artifacts
in units A and B. According to the geoarcheological study (Vallverdú
and Carrancho, 2004), the sedimentary processes in unit B took
place at a faster rate than in unit A. As a consequence, the artifacts
were more rapidly buried and therefore less exposed to thermal
damage.
Artifacts manufactured after ﬁre damage account for 7.5% of the
retouched tools (Figs. 3 and 4). If there was not a preferential

selection of burned blanks for recycling, a similar proportion should
be expected among the unburned artifacts. This percentage
represents a Minimum Index of Recycling of 20.4. Both levels Asup
and A exhibit a similar MRI (20.5 and 20.7 respectively). The MRI for
levels A1 (21.7), B1 (20) and B2 (9) should be considered with
caution due to the small sample size, although the indices for levels
A1 and B1 are practically the same as those obtained in the two
uppermost levels. Taken together, the MRI for unit B is 15.3, which
is slightly lower than the index from unit A. This would suggest that
the intensity of recycling was higher in unit A, but more artifacts
need to be studied to corroborate this temporal trend.
As shown in Table 3, very small items are clearly dominant
among the unburned and pre-damage tools, accounting for more
than 50% of the artifacts. However, very small artifacts are less
common among post-damage tools, which are characterized by an
increase in small pieces. This underrepresentation of the smallest
size class among the tools manufactured after heat damage may be
explained by the lower visibility of the smallest blanks, which tend
to be buried faster than larger objects.
As far as simple tools are concerned, endscrapers are the largest
typological group (37.4%), followed by backed tools (19.4%),
denticulates (12.5%) and retouched blanks (12.4%). The remaining
tool types (abrupts, burins, borers, sidescrapers and truncations)
are present in lower frequencies. As Table 4 shows, pre-damage and

post-damage retouched implements are represented in all of the
typological groups. If only the artifacts retouched after ﬁre damage
are considered, the size of some typological groups is similar to that
recorded in the assemblage as-a-whole, although others exhibit
signiﬁcant differences (Fig. 5). Backed tools are the second most
common tool type in the whole assemblage, but they only amount

to 3% among the post-damage tools. Retouched blanks show the
opposite trend, their percentage in the post-damage assemblage
is signiﬁcantly higher (24.7%) than that recorded in the whole
assemblage. There are also clear differences in terms of the representation of post-damage retouched tools inside each typological
group. The highest percentages of post-damage artifacts are found
among retouched blanks (13.9%) and borers (11.7%), which also
show the highest MRI (32.8 and 33.3 respectively) (Table 5). On the
other hand, backed elements and truncations exhibit the lowest
indices of recycling (4 and 8.6 respectively). Only three backed tools
and two truncations were manufactured on burned blanks. The
scarce number of recycled truncations could be explained by the
lower frequency of recycling in unit B, since truncations are
abundant in these basal layers but uncommon in unit A. However,

this is not the case with backed tools, which are well represented
throughout the sequence. Therefore, it seems that these artifacts,
normally interpreted as hunting armatures, were rarely made on
burned blanks.
We identiﬁed 199 double tools in the retouched assemblage
(Table 6). They represent 12.5% of all the retouched artifacts (Fig. 6).
A large proportion of these tools (55.7%) correspond to endscrapers
with lateral retouch. Twenty-three artifacts were manufactured on
burned blanks and fourteen of them exhibit both pre- and postdamage retouch. The percentage of recycled blanks is higher
among double tools than in the whole tool assemblage (11.5% and
7% respectively). This difference is also evident when comparing
the MRIs from simple and double tools (19 and 29.4 respectively),
suggesting that the incidence of recycling is higher among double
tools. If these data are extrapolated to the whole assemblage, this
means that a signiﬁcant percentage of double tools were not the
result of an intentional design, but rather of recycling previously
retouched blanks. The double tools retouched both before and after
heat damage are particularly interesting, because the type of tool
that was originally on the burned blank can be distinguished from
the type added after burning. Of the 14 artifacts included in this
group, 12 of them indicate that the post-damage retouch event is
associated with an expedient tool type: a denticulate (ﬁve cases)
or a retouched blank (seven cases). In the remaining two cases,
the second tool type was an endscraper. This corroborates the

preferential association of post-damage retouch with the less
formalized tool types, as suggested by simple tools.
4. Discussion
Our results suggest that burned artifacts may provide a useful
approach to the study of recycling in archeological contexts.
However, the incidence of recycling obtained through this
approach should be considered an underestimation of the actual
importance of recycling. A tool manufactured on a burned blank
can be said to be the product of recycling, but the opposite is not
true. We cannot say that a tool made on an unburned blank or one
burned after retouch was not the product of recycling, because in
this case there is no temporal marker that would allow different
and successive events to be distinguished. As a consequence, the
absolute importance of this practice in assemblage formation
remains elusive. In the Molí del Salt assemblage, we were able to
establish that 7.5% of tools were produced on recycled blanks, but
this does not mean that the remaining 92.5% of the blanks were not
recycled. We simply do not know. The feasibility of this approach
also depends on the abundance of burned artifacts available for
study and therefore on site formation processes. It will be more
useful in deposits characterized by the overlapping of occupation
events in which hearths were constructed over remains discarded
by previous visitors. In this sense, palimpsests characterized by
slow sedimentary rhythms would be more suitable in the study of
this kind of recycling than sedimentary contexts of higher resolution in which discarded artifacts were rapidly buried. Moreover,
residential sites deﬁned by activities focused around hearths would
also be very suited to this approach.
The evidence provided by the burned tools of Molí del Salt
suggests that the gathering of previously discarded blanks was
possibly a common provisioning strategy during the Upper Paleolithic. Although the ethnographic data on lithic production are
relatively scarce, this lithic scavenging match the behavioral
patterns observed among modern hunter-gatherers (Horne and
Aiston, 1924; Kelly, 1934; Opler, 1946; Riddell, 1960; Smith, 1974;
Gould, 1977). Both the ethnographic and the archeological studies
tend to explain recycling as a response to raw material scarcity. As

raw material availability can vary over time due to changes in
mobility or subsistence patterns, temporal variations in the intensity of recycling can be expected accordingly. At Molí del Salt, the
decreasing percentage of ﬂint from distant sources from bottom to
top has been interpreted as the result of changes in settlement
patterns characterized by a reduction in the size of the home range.
As a consequence, the increasing stress on local ﬂint sources would
lead to a more economizing behavior, as reﬂected in the decrease of
mean tool size in the upper layers. A greater emphasis on recycling
in the upper layers would be consistent with this picture. However,
our data are inconclusive due to the scarce number of artifacts in
the basal layers and we must wait for larger assemblages in order to
verify this temporal trend.
As lithic resources were transported to occupation sites, those
sites were in turn transformed into lithic provisioning points. In
this context, provisioning decisions may have changed according to
the availability and abundance of artifacts at the sites, especially
comparing the ﬁrst stages in the formation of the stratigraphic
assemblage when the site was “empty”, and the ﬁnal stages, when
the site offered plenty of resources abandoned by previous occupants. This can explain, for example, a part of the chert provisioning
variability documented in the Middle Paleolithic of Abric Romaní
(Vaquero et al., 2012). The availability of artifacts for scavenging
would be more conspicuous in large occupational palimpsests,
associated with slow sedimentary rhythms. Although undocumented as of yet, we cannot rule out that some anthropic disturbances of sediments in archeological sites may be related to the
search for usable lithic materials. As a consequence of lithic scavenging, recycling may be the source of some “cultural anomalies”,
like the appearance of Acheulean handaxes and cleavers in
a Magdalenian layer (Corchón, 1993) or Early Holocene projectile
points in a mid-Holocene assemblage (Amick, 2007). Moreover, this
also has interesting consequences as far as the treatment of raw
materials of different origins is concerned. One of the most
straightforward conclusions of technological studies is that raw
materials tend to be exploited and processed in different ways
according to the distance to their respective provisioning areas.
Exogenous materials coming from distant sources tend to be
transported into the sites in a more elaborately altered form,
whereas local raw materials gathered near the site are normally
more expediently processed. As a consequence, the kind of tools
made on exogenous and local materials also tend to be different.
However, this general principle may be biased by the phenomenon
of recycling. Once transported to the site, exogenous materials
become strictly local resources and, if scavenged for recycling, may
be treated as local and used to manufacture local tool types.
All the typological groups contain artifacts retouched after heat
damage. There is no evidence of the preferential use of burned
blanks for the manufacture of tools requiring high technical
performance, as expected in the case of an intentional heat treatment. In general, most of the lithic tools found in the Molí del Salt
assemblage are easily made through direct percussion ﬂaking and
they were usually produced on unburned blanks. In fact, the types
with the highest MRIs (retouched blanks, borers, denticulates) can
be considered expedient tools that do not involve an elaborate
formal design or planning depth. In this context, recycling seems
the most parsimonious explanation for the use of heated blanks in
the production of tools. In fact, we think that recycling cannot be
ruled out in some instances in which an intentional thermal
treatment has been proposed. For instance, intentional heat treatment has been suggested for the manufacture of Solutrean points in
Parpalló Cave (Tiffagom, 2006). Intentional heating seems likely for
some Solutrean points, but it is not clear for others. Among the leafshaped points there is a high proportion of artifacts retouched after
ﬁre damage (from 68 items, 16 were certainly manufactured on

heated blanks). However, of the 98 barbed and tanged points
studied by Tiffagom, heating before retouch was a certainty in only
one artifact and likely in 14. In spite of the technical complexity of
these artifacts and the use of pressure ﬂaking, heating before
retouch was not dominant and the proportion of probable post-

damage tools was only slightly higher than that exhibited by
some expedient tools e like retouched blanks, borers and denticulates e in Molí del Salt. This indicates that thermal treatment
was not indispensable in the production of these artifacts and we
think that recycling may be a more feasible explanation for the

2794

M. Vaquero et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 39 (2012) 2785e2796

post-damage tools. In order to conﬁrm an intentional heat treatment, a general approach to burned artifacts is needed to test if the
most demanding artifacts are more commonly made on thermally
damaged blanks. If this is not the case, the possibility of recycling
cannot be dismissed.
We found that not all tools were equally manufactured on
recycled items. According to the data we have presented here,
backed tools and truncations were rarely produced on burned
blanks. As mentioned earlier, truncations are abundant in the lower
archeological layers (unit B), which seem to be characterized by
lower recycling indexes. However, backed elements are well represented at all the stratigraphic levels and temporal changes in
recycling intensity therefore cannot explain their low MRI. Backed
tools were used as hunting armatures and were blades and bladelets blunted on one or two sides by small steep removals. The
aerodynamic requirements related to their use as projectile tips
and the need to ﬁt a preexisting shaft cause a high degree of formal
and metrical standardization, higher than those found in other
tools. In addition, they can be considered a good example of
a “reliable artifact” in the sense described by Bleed (1986), that is,
they are designed to minimize the risk of failure in stressful situations. As a consequence, backed tools would be one of the most
curated components in Late Upper Paleolithic technical systems.
Furthermore, manufacture and use locations are clearly different,
since projectile points have to be made in advance and their
production process therefore has to be more planned and scheduled. Backed elements are more demanding in terms of the kind of
blanks that are suitable for their manufacture, since they are made
on blades or bladelets. The probability of ﬁnding a suitable blank
among the previously discarded artifacts would be lower compared
to other tools that can be made on any kind of blank. This is
particularly true in a technical context like that of the Molí del Salt,
in which blade/bladelet production is not dominant and blade/
bladelets represent less than 20% of the discarded blanks. It is
particularly signiﬁcant that of the three backed elements made on
burned blanks, one of them is a backed point made on a naturally
backed blade in which only a small part of the back has been shaped
by retouch (Fig. 7). These partially backed points are unusual
among backed elements and this underscores the expedient character of artifacts made on recycled items.
The Molí del Salt evidence suggests that recycling is more
closely linked to domestic tools, which show a coincidence
between the context of manufacture and the context of use and
are less demanding in terms of the metrical and formal characteristics of the blanks used for their production. Recycling seems
to be a way of meeting immediate needs. As mentioned earlier, the
highest recycling indices are associated with the least formalized
tools e retouched blanks, denticulates, abrupts e which supports
the expedient nature of recycling. In this sense, recycling cannot
be linked to a curated technology, since the most curated
component of a technical system would be the least affected by
recycling. On the contrary, as the expedient character of a technical system increases, a higher frequency of recycling should be
expected. This brings additional support to the differences
between recycling and resharpening, since the latter, aimed at
extending the use life of artifacts, seems more likely in a curated
context.
The higher incidence of recycling among double tools is
particularly important in the interpretation of lithic assemblages,
as it suggests that a high proportion of these tools were not the
expression of well-deﬁned mental templates. This is especially
signiﬁcant in Upper Paleolithic assemblages, in which it is normally assumed that artifacts were manufactured according to
preconceived morphological designs. The degree of standardization exhibited by many Upper Paleolithic tool types indicates that

of the point. This expedient procedure for manufacturing backed tools is uncommon at
Molí del Salt.

such mental templates are beyond doubt in most instances.
However, the temporal nature of at least some double tools
suggests that artifact history is also an important factor in the
typological variability of Upper Paleolithic assemblages. In this
context, composite tools can be considered as indicative of an
economizing or expedient behavior. We obviously need more
cases to conﬁrm this relationship between recycling and multiple
tools. However, if this is corroborated by additional data, the
proportion of multiple tools could therefore be considered as
a proxy of recycling in assemblages in which this practice cannot
be identiﬁed by other methods.

5. Conclusions
The study of burned tools from the Molí del Salt site suggests
that ﬁre damaged artifacts may be a useful approach towards
understanding the phenomenon of recycling in Paleolithic assemblages. Our data indicate that recycling was an important component in the technological behavior of Late Upper Paleolithic huntergatherers. Although the recycling indices derived from burned
artifacts should be considered an underestimation of the actual
importance of recycling, the Molí del Salt data indicate that
a signiﬁcant proportion of tools are associated with the scavenging
of previously discarded blanks. The use of sites as lithic

M. Vaquero et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 39 (2012) 2785e2796

provisioning points was probably an additional reason for the
reoccupation of sites over the millennia, but at the same time such
temporal dynamics changed the relationships between the site and
its landscape, at least as far as lithic provisioning is concerned.
Regardless of geological origin, all lithics should be considered as
local once discarded at the site. In such a context, provisioning
behavior would be less constrained by the distribution of primary
raw material sources. The correlation of recycling with long-term
trends associated with an increasing emphasis on economizing
behaviors, although outlined in this paper, remains an open question and will be the subject of further research.
The Molí del Salt data have also provided some insight into the
technical context associated with recycling, especially concerning
the relationship between recycling and curation. Contrary to
previous assumptions, recycling does not seem to be related to
curated technologies, but would be rather more common in
expedient situations typical of domestic contexts. It would be an
easy form of supplying blanks as needs arose in situations in which
tool manufacture and use were carried out in the same place.
Recycling was particularly suitable for the production of expedient
tools that demanded little in terms of blank form or/and size. On
the other hand, reliable tools that required a more scheduled
production and were made on speciﬁc kinds of blanks were rarely
manufactured on recycled artifacts. The importance of recycling is
therefore conditioned by the organization of technology. It should
become less common as the number of curated components
increase in a technical system.
Recycling appears as just another dimension of the dynamic and
temporal nature of archeological entities, both assemblages and
single artifacts, and emphasizes the need to “temporalize” interpretations in order to understand the behavioral signiﬁcance of
assemblages. Although it seems clear that many Upper Paleolithic
tool types correspond to well-deﬁned mental templates, the
morphology of some artifacts may be the unplanned outcome of
different and successive modiﬁcation events. The artifacts that were
retouched both before and after thermal damage indicate that this
may be the case in particular with multiple tools, especially those in
which the presence of a formalized tool type e endscraper, burin,
truncation e is associated with a more expedient and unformalized
tool type. Increasing proportions of expedient and multiple tools
would therefore be the consequence of a growing emphasis on
recycling in the archeological record. However, additional studies
on burned tools will be needed in order to verify whether these are
general trends in Upper Paleolithic industries or if they are
restricted to speciﬁc chronological or geographical contexts.
