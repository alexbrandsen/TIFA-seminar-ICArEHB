Abstract
The archaeological record attests to the signiﬁcance of ostrich eggs as a valuable resource for the people of the Later Stone Age.
People over a broad geographic range used ostrich eggs to provide nourishment, storage and ornamentation. This paper focuses on
the production, use and discard of ostrich eggshell beads recovered from open-air sites in the Geelbek Dunes of the Western Cape,
South Africa. We present a comprehensive production chain for analyzing the manufacture of beads and introduce the concept of
a heuristic production value for evaluating the degree of completion reﬂected by an assemblage. The pattern of fabrication and the
distribution in size allow for a detailed analysis of the beads that points to speciﬁc behavioral patterns involved in their production.
This analysis yields information about the duration and intensity of site use, as well as the individual members and cultural aﬃnities
of the groups who made the beads. We document the intentional use of ﬁre to blacken the majority of the beads as an aesthetic
choice. Combined with the results from AMS radiocarbon dating, the majority of the beads from Geelbek provide insight into the
socio-economic identity of their manufacturers: small groups of hunteregatherers who inhabited and used speciﬁc locations on the
strandveld near Langebaan Lagoon.

1. Introduction
In 1998 the Department of Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology of the University of Tübingen began the
Geelbek-Anyskop Ausgrabungs und Survey Projekt
(GAASP) in the West Coast region of Western Cape
Province, South Africa (Fig. 1). Over the course of the
eight intervening ﬁeld seasons, a team of archaeologists
from Tübingen surveyed and monitored 114 deﬂation
hollows within the Geelbek Dunes of the West Coast

National Park (Fig. 2) and excavated ﬁnds from 23 of
these open-air localities [6,7,15,17]. These localities
include Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone
Age (LSA) sites selected from both archaeological and
paleontological settings of varying ﬁnd density. Although these localities are presently covered by highly
mobile sand dunes, during most periods of occupation,
the modern set of dunes had not yet migrated into this
region, according to G. Franceschini’s Doctoral Thesis
(2003) from the University of Cape Town. Instead, the
area was characterized by strandveld vegetation of low,
scrubby brush, as evinced by calciﬁed rhizoliths
(fossilized roots) that are visible in the loosely consolidated, uppermost, geological horizon named Ancient
Dune II (AD II) by Felix-Henningsen et al. [9]. Our

whale [16], seal, penguin, ﬁsh, crustaceans and mollusks.
Marine shells also provided the raw material to create
scrapers and ornaments.
The presence of numerous stone features shows that
the LSA people often returned to this area. Burned
concentrations of calcrete blocks mark locations of
stone hearths that often form a focal point for scatters
of many classes of ﬁnds [16]. Unburned concentrations
of calcrete may indicate unused hearths, working areas
or living areas [1]. The presence of plain, spouted and
lugged ceramic vessels may attest to occupations by
herders at some of the localities, but the importance of
pottery as an indicator of herders is contested [22].
Finally, various historical artifacts from the 18th to 20th
centuries bring the scope of archaeological remains into
the present. In 2003, A. Malan and J. Klose from the
University of Cape Town analyzed the modern ﬁnds,
which include artifacts such as clay pipes [18], Chinese
provincial ware, reﬁned industrial ware, a bone pen
knife, powder tins and a coin minted in 1843 among the
shards of ceramic, glass and metal.

research strategy uses the devegetation and deﬂation
caused by mobile sand dunes as a means of sampling the
otherwise invisible archaeology of the strandveld.
The most frequent inhabitants at Geelbek during the
LSA were hunteregatherers who knapped stone tools
characterized mainly by segments, backed bladelets and
small scrapers made from silcrete, quartz and several
other ﬁne grained raw materials. They also utilized
ground stone tools made on coarse grained rocks
including metamorphosed greywacke, quartzite and
granite. Their use of terrestrial resources focused on
small animals such as tortoise, small bovid and dune
mole rat. Less frequent remains of medium and large
sized bovid, as well as rhino and elephant, attest to the
use of larger fauna for subsistence. Domesticated
species, which would indicate the presence of herders,
are rare. From ostrich eggshell (OES) they produced
small and occasionally large beads. The LSA inhabitants
of Geelbek also used marine resources, despite their
location 5 km from the sea. Marine resources included

The production and use of OES beads have been well
documented ethnographically [4,24,25]. Although ostrich eggs may have originally met nutritional needs or
been utilized for storage purposes [19,24], the beadmaking process begins when an ostrich egg breaks,
either intentionally or accidentally. Larger fragments
can be directly processed into ornaments such as discs
and pendants [31]. The smaller pieces may be used as
they are or further fragmented to a desirable size. The
resulting OES pre-forms, or blanks, were often stored in
OES containers [23]. Starting with the blanks, the
production chain takes one of two typical directions.
One entails the initial drilling of angular blanks followed
by rounding, while the other involves the initial rounding of blanks followed by drilling [8,20,31]. Intentional
burning to darken the beads could, in theory, occur at
any point during the sequence.
Beck [3] devised a system to describe any type of bead
based on its form, perforation, color, material and
decoration. With speciﬁc reference to OES beads, Plug
[20] deﬁned nine production stages, including broken
ones, outlining the steps associated with bead preparation. For the purpose of this analysis, we expanded
Plug’s [20] system, incorporating a total of 12 forms into
a sequence that describes the production of a single bead
from initial blank to ﬁnished product (Table 1 and
Fig. 3). In this paper, ‘‘blank’’ (stage 1) signiﬁes an
angular, unmodiﬁed, fragment of OES of appropriate
dimension to enable the manufacture of a ﬁnished bead.
A ‘‘bead’’ refers to any stage of production, while
‘‘ﬁnished bead’’ (stage 11) designates only the ﬁnal,

completed form. A broken, ﬁnished bead (stage 12)
represents the ﬁnal stage in the system of production,
use and discard.
In order to describe and compare the localities at
Geelbek we introduce a heuristic term, the production
value (pv), to quantify the degree to which a group of
beads has reached the endpoint of manufacture. The pv
ranges from 1 to 12 and represents the arithmetic mean
of the analytical results. Thus, a pv of 1 indicates
a group of blanks, while a pv of 12 represents a collection
of broken, ﬁnished beads. The pv is a code that
represents the process involved in the transformation
of a piece of OES into a ﬁnished bead. In the same way,
we employ the standard deviation as a heuristic means

of describing the range of production stages present in
a population of beads. Thus, a lower standard deviation
indicates a greater degree of uniformity in production.
Our reason for conducting such an analysis is based
on Jacobson’s [11] premise that the presence of certain
bead production stages indicates the length of occupation and the extent to which speciﬁc activities occurred
at a given locality. Incorporating ideas about bead
manufacture from the descriptions of Drury [8] and
Schapera [24] among others, Jacobson associates bead
production with places where women lived. Where
blanks are absent, for example at a site used brieﬂy,
such as a kill site, he infers the absence of women. At
sites occupied for a short duration where a small family

group might be present, such as where meat processing
occurred or at a transit camp, he suggests that ﬁnished
beads would be more common, while unﬁnished beads
would be lacking. For sites of long occupation, such as
base or aggregate camps, he expects a greater range of
forms to be present. Thus, Jacobson correlates a wider
spectrum of production forms and sizes with more
intense and longer use of a site. Jerardino [13]
emphasizes the usefulness of this approach in trying to
calculate ﬁnd densities in relation to the duration and
intensity of an occupation.

Jacobson [11,12] argues that the production of
ﬁnished beads in the LSA contains a temporal dimension that relates their maximal diameter to diﬀerent
cultural groups. In his analysis he observed three types
of sites that are characterized by a tendency towards the
production of: (1) predominantly small ﬁnished beads;
(2) a mixed distribution of small and large ﬁnished
beads; and, (3) predominantly large ﬁnished beads.
Jacobson surmised that the small ﬁnished beads were
associated with groups of pre-pottery hunteregatherers
(Type I). A mixture of smaller and larger ﬁnished beads
(Type II) indicated a contact or mixed period, while
groups of earlier (Type IIIA) and later (Type IIIB) postpottery herders preferred increasingly larger forms of
ﬁnished beads. Although Jacobson [11] posits 7.5 mm as
the division between small and large beads, the
boundary separating the majority of beads appears
between 5 and 6 cm. Smith and Jacobson’s [27] report
on the excavations at Geduld (Namibia) supports the
validity of this approach. Yates’ [33] stratigraphically
controlled statistical analysis of the ﬁnished beads from
Geduld conﬁrms that bead size increases with time.
Yates’ results also show that a divide at 5 cm is
appropriate.
Smith et al. [29] propose a model to conceptualize the
material diﬀerences between hunteregatherers and
herders, incorporating average OES bead size, as well
as ﬁnd densities of domesticated stock and pottery. Yet
even within this conceptual framework, the results

A.W. Kandel, N.J. Conard / Journal of Archaeological Science 32 (2005) 1711e1721

presented by Smith et al. [29] suggest that variability in
bead size can be expected. This model seems plausible,
as subsequent studies have demonstrated [26,34]. However, Sadr et al. [22] note that diﬀerences in material
remains at Kasteelberg, about 45 km northwest of
Geelbek, at least during the past two millennia, may
portray diverse economic strategies and not necessarily
separate cultural groups. Sadr [21] argues that pigeonholing speciﬁc attributes as indicators of huntere
gatherers or herders may be too arbitrary and unproductive.
To test these diﬀerent models we plan to compare the
conclusions about production of OES beads at Geelbek
with the results obtained from other ﬁnds, including
faunal remains, lithic artifacts and pottery. Only by
using multiple lines of evidence we can assess the role of
these sites in the LSA economies and settlement
dynamics of the West Coast.

3. Methods
The GAASP team surveyed an area of 400 ha in the
Geelbek Dunes and succeeded in identifying open-air
localities suitable for detailed investigation. The ﬁeld
work entailed the careful recovery of ﬁnds from 23 of the
selected localities (Fig. 2). Using a total station, the
excavators piece-plotted materials, including all lithic
artifacts, faunal remains (O2 cm), marine shell (O1 cm),
OES fragments (O1.5 cm), all beads, all pottery and all
ﬁnd classes from the colonial and modern eras. The
GAASP team also documented and measured features
of burned and unburned calcrete and excavated 1695 m2
units chosen mostly in areas of higher ﬁnd density. By
dry sieving the buckets of sand through 10 and 1.0 mm
screens, the excavators were able to recover the majority
of lithics and OES beads, as well as representative
samples of bone, tortoise, microfauna and marine shell.
The use of very ﬁne screens led to the successful recovery
of very small OES beads and fragments that researchers
often overlook [33].
The incorporation of all information into MS-Access
databases created the framework for subsequent dataentry during laboratory analysis. Using ESRIs ArcMap
8.2, the team integrated the ﬁeld and laboratory
databases into a GIS that includes aerial, topographic,
orthographic, geologic and Landsat maps. The result is
a single, geographically referenced, mapping system that
can be applied regionally. As far as we know, this type
of detailed spatial analysis of large, open-air localities
has not been previously conducted in Southern Africa
[6,7]. The use of such a comprehensive mapping system
allows the dataset of each ﬁnd to be easily accessed and
correlated to its precise geographic setting. Widespread
use of such a system would facilitate inter-site comparison in the West Coast region and beyond.

In the laboratory, GAASP members measured,
weighed and described the OES beads. For each bead,
the team recorded external diameter, thickness and
internal aperture to the tenth of a millimeter and
measured weight to the hundredth of a gram. To
separate small from large beads, GAASP used a limit of
5 cm following Yates’ [33] work. For every bead
analyzed, the team recorded the following attributes:
 complete circumference (yes/no)
 complete aperture (yes/no)
 type of perforation (none, drilled from one side,
drilled from both sides)
 direction of perforation (none, from inside of shell,
from outside of shell, both sides)
 production stage code (1e12)
 color (white, beige, light brown, brown, light gray,
gray, gray/black, black, indet.)
 patina (yes/no)
 burned (yes/no)
 polished (yes/no)
 bead code (1 Z OES bead, 1.1 Z small OES bead
!5 mm, 1.2 Z large OES bead R5 mm)
 additional comments (e.g., indication of wear
facets).
In 2000, C. Weiss of the University of Tübingen
applied this system in her Master’s Thesis to analyze
1780 OES beads from Mumba Cave in Tanzania. Based
on our experience the system is applicable to any
assemblage of OES beads.

4. Results
The following summarizes the results of the analysis
of the beads (Table 2). Of the total number of OES
beads (n Z 1045) from Geelbek, the small beads
(!5 mm) vastly predominate (n Z 1024). Although the
team recovered beads from seven localities, almost all of
the small beads come from three localities, Pottery,
Shelly and Nora (n Z 1019) with the remaining small
beads (n Z 5) from Loop and Toaster. The size
distribution of the 272 small, ﬁnished beads from all
localities yields an average diameter of 3.10 G 0.32 mm
and an average aperture of 1.52 G 0.33 mm. The team
found 66% of the small beads in the 1.0 mm screens
(n Z 675). The high recovery of small beads underscores
the importance of using such a ﬁne mesh.
Of the 21 large beads found at the localities of Toaster,
Stella, Loop and Snoek, ﬁve ﬁnished beads were present,
with an average diameter of 6.68 G 0.99 mm and an
average aperture of 3.04 G 0.73 mm. As one might
expect, a smaller proportion of large beads (29%) came
from the ﬁne screen (n Z 6) as compared to the small
beads. This bias is clearly related to the size of the beads.

Aperture (mm)

Diameter refers to the maximum external dimension of a ﬁnished bead. The aperture of a ﬁnished bead is the maximum internal diameter of the hole
drilled into it.

In all, 60% of the beads are visibly burned, either
black or gray, while the remainder appear unburned
(Fig. 4). Among the assemblages of small, ﬁnished
beads, 91% are burned at Pottery, 28% at Shelly, but
none at Nora. Nor are any of the large, ﬁnished beads
burned. In contrast to the high degree of burning at
Pottery, only 20% of faunal remains and marine shell
appear burned. Additionally, the presence of the entire
range of production forms, from blank to ﬁnished bead,
for both burned and unburned beads suggests two
separate chains of production. The favoring of small,
burned beads at Pottery indicates a stylistic choice by
the individual manufacturers.
Plots of the size of the ﬁnished beads indicate several
interesting trends. First, the diﬀerence in size between
small and large, ﬁnished beads is distinct (Fig. 5),
supporting the division at 5 cm. Second, the diameters
of burned, ﬁnished beads overlap the range of unburned, ﬁnished beads (Figs. 5 and 6A), indicating
a similar mode of production regardless of whether
a bead was burned or not. Third, the apertures of
burned, ﬁnished beads are generally larger, but exhibit
a bimodal distribution, whereas the unburned, ﬁnished
beads display a unimodal distribution (Fig. 6B) that
corresponds to the smaller size range of burned
apertures. The dual size range of burned apertures
could indicate two separate modes of production, or
may merely result from the enlargement of some of the
apertures from use, a consequence of wearing strung
beads. Finally, burned, ﬁnished beads are thinner than
unburned, ﬁnished beads (Fig. 6C) because the eggshell
begins to delaminate during the process of burning.
Among the localities Pottery, Shelly, Nora and
Toaster, analysis of the production stages underscores
the dissimilarities among the respective production
chains, an indication that they represent separate events

(Fig. 7aed). Detailed analysis of the three localities,
Loop, Stella and Snoek, with fewer than 10 beads is not
included here. The deﬁnition and use of production
value (pv) and standard deviation are explained in
Section 3 of this article.
At Pottery (n Z 613) the majority of the small beads
are burned and exhibit a polished patina on the inside
surface of the eggshell. The distribution is unimodal and
demonstrates a production chain that is strongly skewed
toward just the ﬁnal stages (Fig. 7a), with
pv Z 9.08 G 2.01. Almost complete (stage 9) and
ﬁnished beads (stage 11) vastly predominate. Although
most of the intermediate stages are present, they
represent proportionately far fewer beads.
In contrast, early and late stages of small, unburned
beads predominate at Shelly (n Z 219), with the production stages distributed more uniformly than at
Pottery (Fig. 7b). Finished beads (stage 11) and blanks
(stage 1) are most frequent, and the intermediate forms

a wider range of distribution.
At Nora (n Z 187) unburned small beads predominate (Fig. 7c). The curve is unimodal, but in contrast to
Pottery, illustrates a trend toward earlier stages of
production. Burned examples are present only in the
earlier production stages. Intermediate forms are also
more frequent, as indicated by pv Z 3.91 G 2.91. Blanks
(stage 1) and broken, perforated forms (stage 6) are
most common.
At Toaster (n Z 13), where large, unburned large
bead production prevailed, ﬁnished beads (stage 11) and
complete, perforated blanks (stage 5) are most frequent

(Fig. 7d) with pv Z 7.82 G 2.64. Only two small ﬁnished
beads are present with pv Z 11. The population of beads
from Toaster is too small to make more speciﬁc determinations about bead production.
4.1. Burn experiment
To complement the archaeological research, the
GAASP team conducted two series of burning experiments. The ﬁrst attempted to recreate the observed
range of OES color and texture by varying the intensity
of burning, regulating the oxygen concentration and
manipulating the organic content. The second examined
natural variation in the color of OES fragments which
burned as a result of a natural bush ﬁre. The results
indicate that intentional use of ﬁre at a low to moderate

temperature under a reducing atmosphere with the
addition of organic materials enabled the makers of the
beads to control their color. High temperature and long
exposure resulted in pronounced delamination and
subsequent deterioration of the OES, making it unsuitable for further use. These results will be reported in
greater detail in a subsequent publication.
4.2. Radiocarbon dating
Here we present the results of AMS radiocarbon
dating conducted on six of the OES beads at the Leibniz
Laboratory in Kiel (Table 3). A correction factor of
180 G 120 was ﬁrst subtracted for OES [10,30], and then
the result was calibrated using CalPal 2004-SFCP [32].
The combined error was determined by adding the
uncertainties of the individual values in quadrature. The
small beads from the localities of Pottery, Shelly and
Nora cluster in a time range from 550 to 380 cal BC,
placing them in the period of pre-pottery huntere
gatherers before either herding or ceramics became
established in the southwestern Cape. These dates
coincide with the coastally oriented ‘‘mega-midden’’
period of the 1st millennium BC [5,14]. Although a bead
blank from Nora was analyzed, we assume a relationship
to the small beads because only small beads are in
evidence there.
The large beads from Toaster and Snoek date to the
late 1st and mid-late 2nd millennia AD, respectively and
fall into the period after herders and pottery entered the
southwestern Cape. In this case, the economic identity
of the bead makers cannot be securely ascertained.
However, the analysis of the other cultural remains from
Toaster and Snoek will shed light on this question.
Finally, a single, large bead from Loop with a diameter of 7.40 mm yielded an early date of 1820 G 150
cal BC, placing it ﬁrmly within the period of pre-pottery
hunteregatherers. Although this single piece of data
appears to contradict the expectations of Jacobson
[11,12] and Yates [33], it falls within the expected range
of variability reported by Smith et al. [29: Fig. 6a] for

pre-pottery hunteregatherer sites at Paternoster and
Kasteelberg C.

5. Conclusions
At Geelbek all of the small beads (!5 mm) from
Pottery, Shelly and Nora fall into Jacobson’s [11] Type I
site which was occupied by pre-pottery hunteregatherers.
No large beads were recovered from these localities. The
14
C dates of 550e380 cal BC support this interpretation
and correspond well with radiocarbon dates on marine
shell obtained from these localities. The good agreement
of these dates and the similarity of cultural remains at
Pottery, Shelly and Nora suggest that groups of huntere
gatherer occupied these three localities episodically.
Further observations can be drawn about the site-speciﬁc
behaviors involved in the production of ostrich eggshell
beads at these Geelbek localities.
At Pottery, 613 small beads are present in three
separate areas. Despite a signiﬁcant investment of time,
the inhabitants abandoned, discarded or lost these
almost ﬁnished and ﬁnished beads. The predominance
of burned beads and their presence through all stages of
production indicate that burning was an intentional part
of the process. Based on Jacobson’s [11] model, these
results suggest that Pottery served as a short-term camp
for a small family group of pre-pottery huntere
gatherers. Although the analysis of bead manufacture
indicates a predominance of almost complete forms, the
strong skewing of the production curve towards the later
end suggests that some of these beads may have been
manufactured elsewhere. However, clear indications of
wear facets were not evident.
In an attempt to quantify variability in bead making,
Smith et al. [28] analyzed two separate strands of beads
from an ethnographic collection, one small and one
large. They concluded that an individual bead maker
controls 92% of an assemblage of beads to within 1 mm,
assuming that these strands were indeed made by one
person. If the observations made by Smith et al. [28] are

applied to the assemblages from Geelbek, the small
beads from Pottery, and the other localities as well, are
consistent with their stemming from a single strand.
The largest of the three scatters of beads at Pottery is
associated with several large, ﬂat blocks of unburned
calcrete that may represent working surfaces. The
second scatter is associated with a concentration of
lithic artifacts and some burned and unburned OES
fragments, possibly representing the source material for
the manufacture of the beads. The third and smallest
scatter of beads is associated with burned calcrete
blocks. This feature represents a hearth around which
cluster a rich concentration of lithic artifacts made from
diverse raw materials, as well as the remains of tortoise
[2], small bovids, marine shell and most notably, whale
barnacles [16]. The richness and diversity of these ﬁnds
suggest that the Pottery locality was used intensively
during this occupation.
Based on its bead production curve, Shelly oﬀers
evidence that a family group of pre-pottery huntere
gatherers used this site as a comparatively long-term
base camp where the activity of bead-making occurred.
Here the production stages are more evenly distributed,
as shown by an intermediate production value. In
contrast to Pottery, unburned bead production clearly
outweighs the burned component. Two distinct activity
areas can be recognized in Shelly, both of which are
associated with a midden-like accumulation of marine
shell and faunal remains around which a rich scatter of
lithic artifacts is present. Again, the high density of ﬁnds
supports an intensive use of the locality, in this case, as
a comparatively long-term camp.
At Nora, the inhabitants produced small beads in two
areas. The beads from Nora are distinguished from the
other localities by their general state of incompleteness,
as shown by a low production value. Although many
production stages are present, few of the beads
correspond to categories beyond stage 6: since they
broke during drilling, the beads were discarded. The
beads are associated with a hearth of burned calcrete
that also serves as a focal point for intensive stone
knapping. Other classes of ﬁnds include faunal remains,
OES fragments and shell, but these are distributed
evenly across the surveyed area. Jacobson’s model
suggests that Nora served as a comparatively long-term
camp for a family group. Whether the makers of the
beads were ‘‘beginners’’ or only engaged in the earlier
stages of bead production is not clear.
Most of the beads from Toaster correspond to
Jacobson’s Type III site occupied by post-pottery
herders. The radiocarbon date of a bead and the large
number of pottery shards support this conclusion. The
large beads are scattered loosely across the locality in
possible association with the widespread concentration
of pottery. Nonetheless, the economic identity of the
manufacturers of these beads remains unclear. Domes-

ticated livestock have not yet been identiﬁed among the
faunal remains, while lithic artifacts seem to be present
in quantities and types similar to other Geelbek
localities where hunteregatherers are indicated. The
population of beads is too small to deﬁne speciﬁc
activities related to the production of beads.
Due to the small number of beads found at the
remaining localities, Stella, Loop and Snoek, Jacobson’s
model cannot be readily applied, nor can a meaningful
production value be determined. Nonetheless, certain
information can be gleaned from the evidence. For
example, despite the young radiocarbon date on a large
bead from Snoek, the presence of cut-marked eland
remains and a lithic assemblage dominated by backed
bladelets suggest that post-pottery hunteregatherers
contributed to this assemblage. At Loop the unexpected
pre-pottery date on one large bead also indicates that its
manufacturers were hunteregatherers and not herders.
However, it is also possible that an older source of raw
material, found on the landscape, was used to manufacture the bead [15]. Nonetheless, these results indicate
that the chronology of small vs. large beads cannot be
viewed as universal.
Tools associated with the manufacture of beads, such
as grooved stones or drills, are present at several
localities at Geelbek, but they are not always associated
with the beads themselves. Grooved and smoothed
stones are known from Pottery and Shelly while drills
have been documented at Nora, Toaster and Rhino. This
is somewhat puzzling, since our interpretation of the
production chain points to the manufacture of beads at
these localities. One explanation is that the tools
associated with bead manufacture were not recovered
because they were transported elsewhere.
In closing it is clear that the small ﬁnished beads oﬀer
very speciﬁc insights into the habits of their manufacturers. The people who made the small beads were prepottery hunteregatherers, as supported by the results of
the radiocarbon dating. However, the makers of the
large beads cannot always be identiﬁed. In fact, the date
on the oldest large bead indicate that hunteregatherers
were responsible for its manufacture and contrasts with
the presently accepted model. Finally, while our results
point to the utility of Jacobson’s model, we still need to
compare the interpretations derived from the OES beads
with those resulting from diverse analyses of faunal
remains and lithic artifacts that are currently underway.
