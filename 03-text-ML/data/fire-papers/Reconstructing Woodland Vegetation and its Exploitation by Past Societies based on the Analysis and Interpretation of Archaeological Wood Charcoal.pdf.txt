Reconstructing Woodland Vegetation and its
Exploitation by Past Societies, based on the
Analysis and Interpretation of Archaeological
Wood Charcoal Macro-Remains
Eleni Asouti and Phil Austin

Abstract
In this paper the significance of the analysis of archaeological wood charcoal macro-remains as a tool for the
reconstruction of woodland vegetation and its exploitation is discussed. Drawing from both older and more recent
publications a number of theoretical and methodological approaches are examined. It is suggested that greater
integration of charcoal and archaeological data is needed when evaluating charcoal preservation and sample
composition, and that a more coherent theory of the complex ecological and cultural processes affecting species
availability and firewood management needs to be developed.

Introduction
The analysis and interpretation of wood charcoal
macro-remains from archaeological sites has been
extensively used over the past 60 years by archaeobotanists and palaeoecologists as a means for
reconstructing past vegetation and, by inference,
climate patterns (see reviews in Smart and Hoffman
1988; Figueiral and Mosbrugger 2000). One such
example is the detailed palaeoenvironmental sequences built for the western Mediterranean basin
by archaeobotanists trained at the University of
Montpellier II, France (henceforth collectively referred to as the "Montpellier school"), through the
analysis of wood charcoals from multiple sites
covering a wide range of time periods (e.g. Heinz
and Barbaza 1998; Heinz and Thiebault 1998).
Charcoal analysis has been also successfully applied in arid environments, where wood charcoals
derived from stratified archaeological deposits may
represent the only reliable source of palaeoenvironmental information in the absence of well-preserved
pollen sequences with adequate temporal and spatial resolution (e.g. Neumann 1992;Cartwright and

Parkington 1997;Willcox 1999;Asouti and Hather
2001; Tengberg 2002).
This proliferation of research has co-existed
however with the questioning of the value of charcoal
analysis, specifically its reliability as a tool for
reconstructing palaeoenvironments, at least within
the Anglo-American research tradition (see Smart
and Hoffman 1988for a general overview). Serious
debate began in the 1940s in Britain following the
publication of Salisbury and Jane's (1940) analysis
of charcoals from Maiden Castle, Dorset, and the
critical response to it from Godwin and Tansley
(1941).The core of this debate is whether or not the
observed frequencies of individual tree and shrub
species in an archaeological wood charcoal assemblage reflect accurately their actual proportions in
past vegeta tion, and could therefore be used to infer
climate conditions in the past. The objection was
raised that any such correlation is likely to be heavily
distorted by the influence of differential wood combustion alongside ecological (e.g. structure of plant
communities and species physiology) and cultural
variables (wood selection), all affecting species

availability and representation. This remains a
salient criticism of charcoal analysis within the field
of environmental archaeology, particularly in the
UK. A consequence of such criticisms, evident in
many of the standard environmental archaeology
textbooks, is that little explicit reference is made to
charcoal analysis as a distinct discipline (e.g. Evans
and O'Connor 1999)save (in older publications) for
wood identification (e.g.Shackley 1981;Schoch 1986).
In effect, charcoal analysis is largely dismissed as a
credible area of palaeoenvironmental research.
The aim of this paper is to offer a fresh perspective
into the potential of charcoal analysis in the wider
context of environmental archaeology. Two particular issues will be explored in greater detail:
•

•

A critical discussion of the interpretative models,
sampling methodologies and decision-making in the
field and in the laboratory that are used by charcoal
analysts in order to reconstruct past environments.
A consideration of the influences that cultural
formations may exert on fuel collection and consumption practices.

It will be argued that an approach to the subject
which emphasises a multi-layered interpretation of
ecological processes and related human activities,
may enable a more widespread recognition of the
potential of charcoal analysis for the investigation
of palaeoenvironments and their interaction with
past societies.

Vegetation Reconstruction
Macro-remains

from Fuel

Wood charcoals represent one of the most ubiquitous
types of archaeobotanical remains found in archaeological sites. As such they have been used for a
variety of purposes in archaeological and archaeobotanical research, including dating (radiocarbon
and dendrochronology) (e.g. Kuniholm and Newton
1996),the reconstruction of woodland management
practices and deforestation processes (e.g. Miller
1985;Kreuz 1992),the charting of exchange patterns
for valuable timber species in antiquity (e.g. Asouti
2003a), and the analysis of the influences of fuel
selection and context-related variation in the preservation of wood fuel remains (e.g. Pearsall 1983;
Johannessen and Hastorf 1990;Asouti 2003b). One
of the most widely recognised contributions of
charcoal analysis is however the reconstruction of
past woodland and forest vegetation (see references
above). Vegetation reconstruction has been the main
objective of specialists working in this field from its
earliest stages. As early as the 1960sthe French wood
anatomist M. Couvert drew attention to the potential
of charcoal macro-remains for providing a high

resolution picture of past vegetation at a temporal
scale congruent with that of prehistoric habitation,
a trait rarely shared by off-site pollen sequences that
(even when adequately dated) offer a conflated
picture of the local and regional woodland composition (Couvert 1968).
As most specialists working in the field of charcoal
analysis recognise, the availability of woody plants
in the habitation environment is one of the most
important factors determining their ease of collection
as fuel by prehistoric communities. Availability
therefore has been widely used for developing
functionalist interpretations of archaeological wood
charcoal assemblages. The basis for such interpretations is the belief in the existence of a deterministic
relationship between wood selection by prehistoric
societies and the species composition of woodlands,
known as the "Principle of Least Effort" (Tusenius
1986;Scholtz 1986;see also Prior and Price-Williams
1985;Tusenius 1989).According to this hypothesis,
firewood collection in the past occurred in those
wooded areas situated closest to the habitation site
and all species were collected in direct proportion to
their occurrence in woodland vegetation. Hence the
frequencies of individual taxa in any given assemblage, allowing for potential biases introduced by
differential preservation, rates of charcoal deposition
and sampling strategies, can be considered as an
accurate reflection of their proportions in woodland
vegetation at the time of site occupation.
Based on this principle, over the last three decades the Montpellier school has developed a methodological and theoretical approach that has resulted
in the construction of an elaborate model for the
application of charcoal analysis as a method of
palaeoenvironmental research (cf. Chaba11988;1992;
1997;Chabal et aI. 1999). Two particular aspects of
their approach merit mention here. First, the contention that wood charcoals fragment in a mostly
uniform way. This has been expressed in the "law of
fragmentation", originally formulated by L. Chabal
(1988; 1992) based on the statistical analysis of
complete archaeological assemblages. In essence this
law states that charcoal, irrespective of species, tends
to fragment by producing a high number of small
fragments and a low number of large ones. That is,
in an archaeological wood charcoal assemblage mass
(charcoal weight) and number of fragments are
correlated (Chabal 1988; 1992). Secondly, this law
states that the variable effects on charcoal decay of
less controlled parameters involved in combustion,
such as mass reduction (which may be affected
simultaneously by factors such as species anatomy,
moisture content, size of the logs etc.), are independent of the overall fragmentation status of the
archaeological wood charcoal assemblage. Thus, for
the total mass of a charcoal assemblage retrieved

Reconstructing

(a)g g

from an archaeological layer, the law of fragmentation
determines the relative proportions of large and small
fragments for all taxa. That mass reduction and
fragmentation are separate processes is indicated by
the fact that the total mass and the total number of
fragments in the charcoal assemblage are correlated
(see also Fig. 1. For a detailed presentation of the
related statistical analyses see Chaba11988; Chabal
et ale 1999,77-79). Any random biases that (although
rare) might occur in species representation, as a result
of mass reduction or other parameters, can be
compensated for by the application of a strict sampling protocol both in the field and in the laboratory.
This protocol emphasises the identification of sufficiently large assemblages; in temperate and Mediterranean Europe a minimum of 400 fragments per
stratigraphic unit is recommended (Chabal 1988;
Chabal et ale 1999).
Central to the Montpellier school approach is the

deposition plays in the formation and representativeness of a wood charcoal assemblage. Chabal (1992;
Chabal et al. 1999) has argued consistently that no
sound evaluation of the composition of a charcoal
assemblage is feasible, unless the type and duration
of the human activities associated with fuel consumption and the presence of charcoal debris in the
archaeological sediments are adequately understood.
This necessitates differentiating between long- and
short-lived contexts, domestic and external spaces,
and different types of refuse deposits (Chabal et al.
1999; see also Table 1). In summary, archaeological
charcoal assemblages must fulfil three criteria to
qualify for the purpose of palaeoenvironmental
reconstruction:
To represent charcoal deposits accumulated over a
prolonged period of time (secondary refuse, i.e.
scattered charcoal), not short-term or episodic events
(primary refuse, e.g. hearth deposits). Secondary
deposits are more likely to produce a high diversity
of woody taxa thus maximising the potential of
analysis for vegetation reconstruction. They can also
be expected to have been subject to broadly the
same range of post-depositional alterations. By
contrast, even if substantial quantities of charcoal
are retrieved from short-term deposits and a high
degree of taxonomic diversity is established, the
probability that these are related to the specific
circumstances of the last firing event, and do not
represent a lasting trend, cannot be eliminated.
Furthermore, with regard to preservation conditions, short-term deposits may have been subject to
diverse post-depositional transformations.
To be primarily the result of domestic fuel burning
activities. Depending on the predicted frequency of
the disposal events (day-to-day or at longer intervals), they are more likely to characterize lasting
patterns of fuel-related activities.

allow statistically meaningful analysis.

The impact that human selection may have on species
presence and the difficulties inherent in reconstructing it accurately (particularly for prehistoric sites) is
recognised in principle (Chabal 1992). Chabal
however chooses to focus on burning qualities as the
principal factor that may affect human choices, in
order to demonstrate that ecological imperatives (i.e.
availability) will eventually overtake any concept of
"preferred species". Thus she emphasises that the
burning properties of each type of wood depend
more on physical parameters, like pole size and

diameter, its status as fresh or deadwood, moisture
content, fire temperature etc., than on the inherent
characteristics (anatomical, physiological and chemical) of the species from which it derives (Chabal
1992). Based on this reasoning she argues that, for
domestic firewood, the spectrum of taxonomic frequencies observed in a selected sequence of samples
represents in every case a compound picture of the
source plant communities. Therefore, it is not methodologically valid to assume that a list of taxa and
their respective frequency values (measured as
percentage fragment counts) can be directly translated into specific ecological units (the analogy here
to research paradigms familiar from pollen analysis
is evident). Such values can only be used to infer
palaeoenvironmental change over time through the
application of the appropriate ecological theory. The
ultimate aim of the analysis is to reconstruct as
accurately as possible past vegetation by removing
each· of the cultural, analytical and taphonomic
filters" intervening between the extant charcoal
assemblage and the source area (vegetation) from
which firewood derived (Chabal1992; Chabal et aI.
1999; see also Fig. 2).
The main critique of the approach of the Montpellier school, particularly among Anglo-American
research, has focused on the perceived inappropriateness of charcoal macro-remains for reconstructing
palaeovegetation based on quantitative analysis
(particularly percentage fragment counts), due to the
differential responses of individual taxa to the effects
of burning (e.g. Zalucha 1982;Lopinot 1984, 130-1;
Rossen and Olsson 1985;Smart and Hoffman 1988;
Keepax 1988).Thus some researchers have promoted
1/

deposits for charcoal analysis (drawing from

different forms of quantification. One relatively
common method is by weight (e.g. Miller 1985,
Cartwright and Parkington 1997). However, the
Montpellier school has objectivelydemonstrated that
fragment numbers and weight measurements represent in nearly all cases co-varying parameters
(see discussion above, Fig. 1).Another is by ubiquity
analysis (see Willcox 1974,Smart and Hoffman 1988,
Thompson 1994).There have also been suggestions
for the complete rejection of quantitative methods, as
they are deemed unreliable for reconstructing either
past vegetation or wood use; instead the adoption of
qualitative means of vegetation description is promoted (Zalucha 1982).Ubiquity analysis and qualitative vegetation descriptions may be appropriate
for reconstructing past vegetation in certain environmental contexts (see below) or when considering
regional assemblages that have been studied with
variable sampling and analytical techniques (cf
Hubbard 1980).However, ubiquity analysis may also
obscure patterns relating to the intensity of fuel
exploitation, especially when the frequency of use of
individual taxa remains broadly the same but
abundance changes (cf Popper 1988, 64). In other
words, what the analyst may end up with is a more
or less even distribution of charcoal taxa across the
sampled sequence, with little, if any, information as
to their relative input to sample composition. Although the influence of the charring process and
related methodological issues are no less important
(cf Asouti 2001, 86-88), it is our opinion that
approaches to the quantification of charcoal macroremains could substantially benefit from closer
scrutiny of the methodological suggestions of the

Montpellier school (particularly those concerned
with sampling in the field and the number of
fragments to be microscopically analysed; see below).
That such an understanding has, in many cases,
failed to materialise is evident in those charcoal
studies that opt for an outright rejection of any
quantitative approach, without considering the
effects of parameters such as sample size, depositional context, and hearth type and function on taxon
representation (e.g. Zalucha 1982; cf Asouti 2001,
102-5).
Ultimately, the suitability of different quantification techniques (and hence the very utility of the
method) for the purpose of vegetation reconstruction
can only be assessed through the evaluation of the
practical application of charcoal analysis and its
actual results. In the Western Mediterranean, where
the Montpellier school has been mostly active, a
number of parameters have contributed in the
production of reliable palaeoecological sequences
from quantified charcoal macro-remains (based
always on the percentage fragment counts of charcoal taxa). These can be summarised as follows:
•

•

•

The adoption of a strict sampling protocol in the
field, targeting long-term deposits (general charcoal
scatters) and excluding short-term ones like hearths
(see discussion above and Table 1).
The sampling of a number sites and the comparison
of charcoal assemblages among sites in order to see
whether common patterns emerge concerning taxon
representation.
The consideration of detailed descriptions of modern

•

vegeta tion types. These consist of the number and
the autecology and synecology of species per woodland habitat type, as these can be inferred from
modern ecological studies. The main aim here is to
see how the ratios observed in the charcoal assemblage between individual taxa compare to those
observed in known modern woodland environments.
The availability of other sources of palaeoenvironmental information that may complement charcoal
data in inferring past environmental change (mostly
pollen but also snails, other archaeobotanical remains, fauna etc.).

Studies where these particular methodologies have
been systematically applied in temperate Europe and
west Mediterranean environments, have demonstrated that the results of charcoal analysis correlate
very closely with those of off-site pollen studies (e.g.
Chaba11997; Heinz and Thiebault 1998;Heinz and
Barbaza 1998; Pernaud 2001). In addition, these
studies have shown that, depending on the type of
habitation site (permanent or seasonal), any differences observed between the two sources of palaeoecological information can be almost always explained adequately as the result of either localised
vegetation responses to human activities (e.g. clearance), or of the predicted distance of particular
woodland species and vegetation types from the
habitation sites (hence explaining the absence from
the charcoal record of certain taxa present in pollen
diagrams). It follows that the end result of a systematic
application of charcoal analysis may provide a

6

E. Asouti and P. Austin

picture of past vegetation considerably more precise
in terms of the physiognomy, composition and
changes in the local vegetation catchments, than that
available through off-site palynology.
This last point becomes even more pertinent for
sites in arid and tropical environments. In these
areas, well-preserved and dated pollen sequences
are nearly universally absent, owing to sedimentary
conditions and the general rarity of suitable coring
sites. Particular types of vegetation communities (e.g.
the oak park woodland and the woodland steppe in
Southwest Asia) tend to be under-represented in
regional palynological studies because many of their
constituent taxa (e.g. Rosaceae) are insect-pollinated
rather than wind-pollinated (Asouti and Hather
2001; Wold ring and Cappers 2001). Perhaps the
greatest obstacle to vegetation reconstruction in arid
and, more so, in tropical regions is the high floristic
diversity which can inhibit precise botanical identifications (Thompson 1994;Scheel-Ybert 2001).This
aside, the methodologies followed for interpreting
the frequencies of charcoal taxa derived from stratified deposits depend largely on the specificvegetation
types predicted for each area under investigation. In
areas where a homogeneous forest cover and/ or
uniform vegetation types are predicted, an approach
similar to that described for temperate environments
may prove productive. By contrast, for areas where
there is sharp vegetation zonation (resulting for
example from localised differences in rainfall and/
or soil types across the territory of the site and the
presence of a high diversity of microenvironments
and ecotonal zones), the archaeological wood charcoal assemblages may well be very diverse, containing taxa from a series of spatially distinct woodland
types. Such a pattern was identified, for example, in
the analysis of charcoal from six shell-mound sites
in the southeast Brazilian coast, where taxa deriving
from a variety of woodland habitats and plant
communities were represented in nearly equal proportions through the timespan covered by the sampled sequence (Scheel-Ybert 2001). In principle
therefore, it is very likely that what will be reflected
in the charcoal sequence is not so much a "dominant"
vegetation type and its transformations (human and/
or climate induced) through time, but instead the
compound picture of a series of vegetation habitats.
Provided that indicator species and/ or distinct
vegetation types (necessarily based on modern
ecological analogues) can be securely defined, their
fluctuations in the sequence are thus more likely to
reflect the varying degrees and intensity with which
they were exploited for fuel collection in the past,
than long-term vegetation changes attributable to
climate change (Willcox 2002).
An example of a similar situation is presented by
the charcoal assemblage derived from the large early

Neolithic tell-site of ~atalh6yiik, in the Konya plain,
south-central Anatolia (Asouti and Hather 2001;
Asouti in press). Given the location of the site and
the complex configuration of its environs (comprising
a variety of riverine, marsh, steppe and park woodland habitats), it was originally predicted that wood
derived from all these different catchments could be
represented in the charcoal samples. Therefore,
abundance data (i.e. percentage fragment counts)
were deemed largely unsuitable for defining and
reconstructing woodland composition and structure,
since fuel wood might have been collected from a
mosaic of different vegetation types. Furthermore,
with the exception of riverine trees and shrubs, most
of the taxa encountered in the charcoal assemblage
could have occurred in more than one vegetation
type (e.g.certain members of the Rosaceae family are
found in woodland steppe vegetation as well as oak
park woodland; Hillman 2000). Therefore, in this
case, the combined use of taxon presence data,
modern analogues for community and individual
species ecology, field observations and comparisons
with the extant palaeoenvironmental record, seemed
to be a much more useful avenue for reconstructing
the composition and structure of the diverse woodland types. However, quantified taxon frequencies
(percentage fragment counts) were found useful as a
tool for reconstructing how intensively each of these
vegetation catchments was exploited in the past, and
the long-term effectsof human activities and environmental change (as far as these could be disentangled)
on woodland structure and composition (Asouti and
Hather 2001; Asouti in press).

Some Methodological

Considerations

An important consideration in wood charcoal studies concerns the size and number of samples that are
likely to provide statistically meaningful results about
sample composition. In principle, optimal sample
size (the number of fragments per sample required
for obtaining a reliable picture of taxon presence and
their relative proportions) varies depending primarily
on the degree of accuracy required (cf van der Veen
and Fieller 1982).For charcoal analysis, some authors
have suggested that (where modern vegetation
communities can be studied in detail or quantitative
analyses of community ecology are already available)
estimating sample efficiencycan be achieved through
the use of the Gini-Lorenz concentration curves.
These can allow the identification of standard
numbers of fragments common for most types of
analyses, through the estimation of generally acceptable levels of accuracy corresponding to different
vegetation types (for a detailed description of its
application in the analysis of west Mediterranean

Reconstructing

Woodland Vegetation and its Exploitation

assemblages see ChabaI1997). The method consists
of plotting the floristic diversity of the vegetation
sample against the number of charcoal samples as a
"saturation curve". "Saturation curves" derive from
the work of several authors who have observed that
taxonomic recovery follows an exponential curve:
the number of taxa present in a sample rises sharply
as the first few charcoal specimens are examined
and then settles down as more fragments are identified (cf. Keepax 1988,44; Smart and Hoffman 1988;
Chabal et al. 1999, 67).
For temperate environments, Keepax (1988,1204) has suggested that a minimum of 100 fragments
per sample should be examined, which can be
extended up to 300-400 fragments per stratigraphic
level. Based on their experience of west Mediterranean sites, Chabal et al. (1999, 66) raise this
lower limit to 250fragments, with 400-500fragments
considered as the optimal subsample size per
excavated level. Such differences in the recommended minimum numbers of identifications reflect
of course different levels of floristicdiversity between
the UK and mainland Europe. For tropical regions,
characterized by high floristic diversity, Scheel-Ybert
(2002)has calculated the minimum subsample size
in the range of 200-300 charcoal fragments per
sample. Subsamples in this range gave species
concentration indices similar to those found in
modern vegetation units (for further details on
sampling and the statistical procedures followed in
this particular study see Scheel-Ybert 2002).
Other researchers have observed that the point
when taxon recovery curves level off is not solely a
function of the number of examined fragments, but
also depends on the spatial extent of the sample
population across the excavated level (Badal Garcia
1992). Provided that results are replicated across
samples for each level, such a strategy may also
prove useful for suggesting possible targets for
sample identification. By maximising the spatial
coverage of sampling within each excavated and/ or
stratigraphic level, it is also possible to compensate
for temporary and, for that reason, largely unpredictable "levelling-off" sometimes observed in
individual recovery curves (FigueiraI1992). Keepax
makes a similar point when she states that" overidentification of individual samples does not compensate for insufficient sample number ... A certain
number of samples must always be identified to
account for between-sample variation" (Keepax1988,
45). However, it should be kept in mind that more
extensive spatial coverage may mask (if applied
without careful consideration) variation between
samples that could otherwise be very informative,
for example when considering context-related variation in sample composition and comparing different
context types.

Equally important in terms of subsample determination is the size range of the fragments chosen
for analysis. Such a selection can be achieved through
splitting the sample and randomly choosing a portion
of it (Willcox 1974), "grab-sampling" fragments of
different size and shapes (Miller 1985) or passing
the dry flot through a stack of sieves of graded mesh
sizes and subsampling each size fraction (Zalucha
1982,79). Of all three methods, dry sieving is by far
the most efficient for charcoal analysis. Grabsampling suffers from a lack of standardisation thus
being inherently subjective, whereas splitting the
sample with a riffle-box will invariably result in
further fragmentations. The use of grid systems can
prove very time-consuming without also being
altogether free of similar subjective elements (van
der Veen and Fieller 1982). Depending on the
preservation of the material, it is generally considered
preferable to concentrate on the >4mm fraction of
dry-sieved material as smaller fractions (>3mm >1mm) are likely to contain too many unidentifiable
fragments (due to their size) (Keepax 1988;Chabal et
al. 1999).However research constraints or particular
project requirements may necessitate including
<4mm fractionsif,for example, not enough fragments
of >4mm are available due to preservation conditions
(e.g. Asouti 2003a) or the analysis also aims at
plotting the presence and frequencies of small-sized
woods such as shrubs whose charcoal is more likely
to be retained in <4mm fractions (e.g. Asouti and
Hather 2001; Asouti in press).
As to the number of samples to be analysed
(depending on the research objectives and the
available resources), ideally the recovery from
twenty-five to fifty samples on average may be
considered as a reasonable minimum, whereas for
more complex archaeological sites with a greater
variety of depositional contexts, one hundred or more
samples may be required. This may not always be
possible, particularly for sites that do not have wellpreserved charcoal assemblages (see Asouti 2003a).
Therefore the results derived from such necessarily
limited assessments of sample composition should
be viewed with caution with regard to their environmental interpretation. For multi-period settlements,
intra-site comparisons between contexts and/ or
excavated levels necessitate similar provisions
(Keepax 1988, 45-47).

Reconstructing

Firewood

Exploitation

Many scholars, now and in the past, have stressed
the unique character of archaeological wood charcoals derived from fuel use, representing the product
of purposeful human action within the period of site
habitation, and have thus cautioned against their

8

uncritical use as climate indicators in a manner like
that of off-site pollen sequences (e.g. Western 1971;
Smart and Hoffman 1988; Thompson 1994; Figueiral
and Mosbrugger 2000). This observation does not
diminish the value of charcoal analysis as a tool for
vegetation reconstruction (see previous sections). It
does point however to the necessity for developing
specific theoretical and methodological models that
will deal with small-scale processes of vegetationculture interactions, in order to address questions
relating to local vegetation change and the interpretation of prehistoric firewood management. The
rest of this paper will therefore concentrate on the
issue of human selection and attempt to place it in
its proper ecological and cultural context.
The availability of species for firewood exploitation is not solely a function of net species abundance.
Usually it reflects a synthesis of complex ecological
processes affecting species representation
in ways
that may be unrelated to large-scale environmental/
climate change (Shackleton and Prins 1992). Ethnographic and archaeological research has established,
for example, that factors such as the abundance of
dry dead-wood, which poses almost minimal requirements concerning its ease of collection and transportation, may be the most influential factor in
firewood collection (e.g. Heizer 1963; Ford 1979;
Scheel- Ybert 2001; Asouti in press; Austin unpublish-

ed material; see also Fig. 3). Where this is the case it
can affect the range of taxa collected as fuel, not least
because different species may shed parts more readily
than others, either spontaneously or due to stress of
competition for light and seasonal deficiencies in
ground moisture (Godwin and Tansley 1941; Millington and Chaney 1973).
Furthermore, the rate by which certain species of
trees and shrubs regenerate
and colonise new
habitats as a response to disturbance (woodcutting,
land clearance, browsing etc.) can also stimulate
periodic increases in their exploitation as easily
renewable firewood resources (Minnis and Ford
1977). Other important
factors affecting species
availability include the age and structure of the tree
stands and their seasonal transformations
(Austin
2000). Old-growth stands, comprising mature to overmature trees, will provide ample quantities of deadwood in the form of dying or dead branches in the
canopy, fallen lateral branches, snags (standing dead
trees)/boles and down logs (fallen trees) (Kirby 1992;
Peterken 1992). Also, disturbed areas (e.g. forest gaps
created by wind, fire of natural and/ or anthropogenic
origin, clearance etc.) will accommodate fast growing,
light-demanding
trees and shrubs, which could be
relatively easy to harvest considering parameters
such as pole size and height. They can also provide
habitats characterized by increased availability of

Reconstructing

Woodland Vegetation and its Exploitation

herbaceous graze for woodland mammals and a
higher diversity of plant and animal resources
compared to undisturbed, "climax" forests (Barkham
1992; Ratcliffe 1992). Such environments are therefore
amenable to exploitation for a combination of purposes including hunting, plant gathering and fuel
collection, which are furthermore likely to be organised on a seasonal basis.
Species availability may also be linked to cultural
perceptions of woodlands, which can actively encourage or discourage the distribution of particular
species across the landscape (Unruth 1994). Trees
and shrubs may be preferentially selected for their
burning qualities, the physical properties and size
of wood, and the cultural beliefs attached to them
(Austin 2000). Smart and Hoffman (1988) also cite
many examples from the ethnographic record whereby certain types of wood are seasonally collected on
such a basis. Inherited perceptions or differences in
social status may also exert an important influence
on fuel acquisition practices among different groups
(Ford 1979). A careful consideration of the charcoal
record in relation to the information available on the
archaeological context of the charcoal remains, and
any intra- or inter-site variations in sample composition may provide a good starting point for addressing
such questions from a sound factual basis (Chabal
1992).

Charcoal analysts have at their disposal an
increasing body of literature describing small- to
medium-scale ecological processes such as those
described above, which is also complemented with
a wealth of anthropological studies on human
perceptions of trees and woodlands (e.g. Rival 1998).
What however seems to be ill-represented in the
relevant literature is a systematic concern with the
construction of models for addressing the influence
of cultural formations on fuel collection,consumption
and discard. Important exceptions are analyses that
deal with archaeological case studies of the impact
of permanently settled communities on past vegetation (e.g. Miller 1985; Willcox 2002), statistical
approaches to the investigation of local vegetation
changes in relation to firewood management (e.g.
Pique and Barcel6 2002), and methodological studies
concerned with the representativeness of hearth
charcoal assemblages (e.g. Ntinou 2002, 117-22).
Aside from achieving a more balanced understanding
of the palaeoenvironmental representativeness of
archaeological charcoal assemblages, such considerations could enable the meaningful integration
of charcoal macro-remains in the currently available
models of ancient subsistence economies. For this
purpose, it is necessary to recognise that fuel remains
represent the material residues of a complex interplay
between long-term environmental change, localised
ecological/vegetation processes, economic produc-

tion and cultural formations.
To illustrate the value of such an approach, three
general categories of subsistence adaptations (mobile
hunter-gatherers, nomadic pastoralists and settled
agriculturalists) are presented here. Whilst "most
living peoples combine these subsistence practices
in various ways" (David and Kramer 2000, 227) by
focusing on these established analytical units of
archaeological enquiry, such a survey can be used
for developing appropriate interpretative models. It
should be noted that these models have mainly
heuristic value, in that they are based on a limited
number of extant ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological studies concerned directly with fuel collection and consumption or, more generally, with
resource procurement and the spatial organisation
of fire-related activities. Future ethnoarchaeological
research (backed by experimental studies on the
effects of different burning environments on sample
composition) would certainly enhance any predictive
value held in the proposed models.

Predictive model 1: mobile hunter-gatherers
(Table 2)
In general, hunter-gatherer groups can be expected
to rely for their needs in firewood mainly on what
is available in the immediate vicinity of the campsite and to use local vegetation on a quasi-opportunistic basis. However, differentiation within this
general model could also occur, depending on the
range of the exploited resources, their frequency of
exploitation and patterns of mobility (cf Binford
1980). Thus, it has been observed that "foraging"
groups (characterized by high residential mobility,
low-bulk inputs and regular daily forays for food
procurement) are very different in this respect from
"collecting" groups. The latter may be much more
selective in their choice of resources, extract them
in bulk quantities, and also invest in complex
arrangements of resource storage and sharing (Binford 1980).
Non-permanent habitation sites may also introduce perceptions of resource" affluence" which could
encourage fuel collectors to apply very selective
criteria in their choice of firewood species. However,
species may not be the sole or even the main criterion
for choosing fuels: fuel exploitation strategies may
target easily collectable wood (e.g. dry deadwood,
fallen branches, driftwood etc.). It has also been
observed that concepts of "preferred firewood"
among hunter-gatherers are more likelyto correspond
to the functions of multi-purpose hearths (e.g. for
lighting, smoking, cooking, protection etc.), instead
of modern concepts valuing heating efficiency and
the ease of ignition of individual species (Thery
2002).

Table 2. Predictive model 1: mobile hunter-gatherers.

Most of the hearths used by mobile groups are
characterized by variable lifespans and are typically
located outdoors. Intermixing and displacement of
deposits may occur as a result of cooking activities,
shifts of activity spots, and the trampling of habitation deposits (Binford 1983, 157; O'Connell 1987).
On the other hand, covered hearths are more likeIy
to retain wood charcoals in a good state of preservation (March 1992). Fuel debris may be cleaned from
hearths on a daily basis, or (for open-air hearths) at
longer intervals. It may be scattered around activity
areas (appearing as charcoal and ash concentrations
around hearths) or beyond the limits of the living/
working space (forming sometimes distinct ash
dumps) (cf O'Connell 1987; O'Connell et al. 1991;
Bartram et al. 1991).

Predictive model 2: nomadic pastoralists
(Table 3)
Nomadic pastoralists rely on firewood not only for
satisfying daily heating and cooking requirements
but also for production purposes, i.e. the preparation
and processing of milk-products (Martin 1980).
Converting milk into various products that can be
stored for later consumption and exchange requires
large amounts of firewood, preferentially gathered
from areas within easy walking distance from the
campsite (Cribb 1991). For example, extant estimates
from northwestern Iran report that the maintenance
of 250 milking animals requires some 21 tons of fuel
per season most of it expended in milk processing
(Horne 1994, 62-64). Given the demands in fuel of
milk processing activities and their seasonal nature,
what matters most from the pastoralist's viewpoint
is the actual quantity of biomass available rather than
the form or species of fuel. Fuel is collected and burnt
indiscriminately and may comprise live and dead
vegetation alike (Martin 1980). Such a process could

also result in the accumulation of large quantities of
bulk fire debris near processing areas, especially in
the case of repeated visitations to the same spots.

Predictive model 3: settled agriculturalists
(Table 4)
For sedentary farming communities firewood related
activities are altogether more complex. With regard
to the spatial distribution of fuel waste, additional
sources of patterning may represent the variable
cultural contexts affecting discard practices, and the
reworking of fuel debris (cf Watson 1979, 37-39;
LaMotta and Schiffer 1999). From an ecological
perspective, permanent settlements exert a significant
and, sometimes, irreversible impact on their environments, which is further conditioned by the range of
demands placed on vegetation (e.g. for fuel, fodder,
timber, pasture etc.). These demands are in turn
determined by the complex set of economic activities
and social relationships taking place within the
community. We have isolated three main themes
relevant to the understanding of the attitudes of
farming communities towards woodland resources:
resource ownership (determining access to woodlands), the contribution of deadwood and woodcutting, and the seasonal scheduling of firewood
collection.
woodland accessibility and resource ownership
In sedentary communities access to woodlands is
primarily a function of ownership (individual or
communal). There are several kinds of individual
ownership, including household, lineage or community property, which can determine the right to
own, inherit, plant or dispose of trees (cf Horne 1982)
and may include diverse units such as gardens, fields
or entire woodlands (Devres Inc. 1980). Communal
ownership has been far more common in societies

where the institution of "common lands" exists
(reserved for firewood, grazing, hunting, fodder
provisioning, wild plant foods, timber, medicinal
plants etc.) (Devres Inc. 1980;Michael Arnold 1997;
Scherr 1997).Restrictions on woodland exploitation
can be realised through the exertion of authoritative,
religious or hereditary rights, which aim at the
preservation of woodland resources (e.g. Dei 1992;
Unruth 1994;Smith et al. 1996).Conservation practices may also incorporate notions of recycling and
economic behaviour (e.g. through the re-use of
defunct structural timber as fuel, the adjustment of
cooking practices in order to minimise loss of heat,
and the proscription of burning objects fashioned in

wood) (cf Chapman 1948;Devres Inc. 1980;van Beek
and Banga 1992).Hearths may be used for composite
purposes too such as cooking, food processing and
small-scale industries (Devres Inc. 1980;Horne 1994).
the relative contribution of deadwood and wood
harvesting
Burning qualities and ease of collection may influence agriculturalists in choosing which species or
even plant parts will be harvested as firewood.
There seems to be a universal agreement concerning
the qualities of "ideal" firewood (dense, burning
with a strong hot flame, and drying rapidly), but
there may also exist several variations with regard

12

E. Asouti and P. Austin

to the ease of collection of particular types of wood.
Deadwood (fallen branches and trunks) is always
highly ranked, followed by twigs and live branches
and, when communities are faced with severe fuel
shortages, cutting of saplings and trees proper.
Deadwood may be "manufactured" by girding or
ring-barking trees when insufficient quantities of it
are naturally available, or groups face official restrictions (Devres Inc. 1980). Practical considerations can also dictate the size of the firewood
gathered, such as the type of tools used and the
distance of the collection point from the settlement.
When tree cutting is deemed necessary, species cut
may be those at the pole stage, which is also likely
to enhance woodland regeneration and stimulate
biomass production (Shankar et al. 1998).
seasonality and scheduling of firewood collection
Fuel gathering may be combined with seasonal tasks
such as land clearance and fodder collection (Ben
Salem and van Nao 1981; Horne 1982; Townsend
and Guest 1980; Ertug-Yaras 1997, 183-4). In arid
environments the dry season, after harvest, may be
the preferred period (wooded areas are easier to
access, days are longer and dry wood is more
abundant) (Devres Inc. 1980). In temperate regions
the preferred season is late winter or early spring,
particularly where pruning, coppicing and pollarding are involved, in order to avoid damage to trees
during the growing season (in arid regions the
growing season may be further constrained by
extremely dry summers). Fuel collected on a seasonal
basis is commonly stored for consumption during
the rest of the year. Small amounts of firewood (twigs,
branches and bark) can be collected and brought
back to the settlement throughout the year (Fleuret
and Fleuret 1978).

Archaeological

Case Studies

To demonstrate how a multi-layered approach to the
reconstruction of past vegetation and firewood
collection practices may be applied to archaeological
material, two case studies are presented in which an
explicit attempt to incorporate these principles in
the analysis and interpretation of the archaeological
charcoal assemblages was made. The sites selected
are two Anatolian Neolithic sites that conform to
predictive models I, 3 (mobile hunter-gatherer,
pastoralist) and 2 (permanent agricultural settlement). These are, respectively, a complex of seasonally
occupied campsites at Plnarba~l (Watkins 1996;
Asouti 2003b)and the tell site of ~atalh6yiik (Mellaart
1967;Hodder 1996;Asouti and Hather 2001;Asouti
in press). A further advantage for selecting these
sites was that they occupy broadly the same environmental setting (the open woodland/ steppe / wetlands

ecotone of the south-central Anatolian plateau) thus
offering an opportunity for a meaningful comparison
of their results.

Mobile hunter-gatherer/pastoralist
Plnarba§l (PN)

settlement:

The PN wood charcoal assemblage comprised 7,197
fragments derived from 36 flotation samples. Two
sites (PN A - an open-air site situated on a lakeside
location and, nearby, PN B - a rockshel ter facing
PN A) were sampled, with the majority of samples
originating in PN B. The characterisation of PN A
as a hunting and PN B as a hunting and pastoralist
campsite has been based primarily on the lack of
substantial architectural remains and the results of
faunal analysis (Watkins 1996; D. Carruthers pers.
comm.).
taphonomy
The earliest Neolithic deposits (PN A) were extremely
poor in charcoal. The most likely explanation for
poor preservation is the sedimentary environment
(limestone, responsible for the abundance of mineral
precipitates in the charcoal fragments) and bioturbation. Therefore the frequency values of the taxa
found in these samples were not considered as
reliable indicators of the proportions of taxa burnt in
the past. By contrast, in PN B the late Neolithic
(discarded bulk charred debris and animal bone
derived from the infill of a dry-stone revetment wall,
and from activity areas external to the wall) and the
Chalcolithic deposits (activity spots and fire installations) gave enormous quantities of wood charcoal.
The faunal analysis has indica ted that the rockshelter
hosted a seasonal camp, inhabited for short periods
of time (D. Carruthers pers. comm.). A few slabcovered hearths (Chalcolithic) preserved in very low
quantities rare taxa such as juniper, wild plum and
oak. The frequency of occurrence of reeds and small
sized woods (e.g. low shrubs), all likely to have been
consumed entirely in open fires, was also very low.
woodland vegetation and exploitation
Sample composition was uniform across phases,
particularly with regard to the frequencies of the
dominant taxa (terebinth and almond, followed by
rose and tamarisk) (see Fig. 4). The fact that the
rockshelter was used only as a temporary station
may explain the absence of evidence for any mediumto long-term impact on local vegetation (a mixture of
open woodland steppe and lakeside halophytic
vegetation). The charcoal evidence suggests an
opportunistic pattern of woodland exploitation,
centred on the irregular collection of readily available
branch wood (both cut and collected as fallen and/
or standing deadwood; see Asouti 2003b, 1199).

change and fuel exploitation. Midden areas have
been identified in CH as the main communal repository of domestic refuse. By contrast, very low
densities of charred debris were obtained from built
spaces and other context types such as external
areas used for the burning and preparation of lime
plaster, domestic hearths, feature and building
infills etc.

In CH 28,959fragments of charcoal were examined,
derived from 126 flotation samples belonging to
various context types. Given the enormous contextual variation, it was decided to prioritise for
analysis midden samples that could furnish reliable
information on long-term patterns of vegetation

taphonomy
Midden samples were the richest and most consistent
in terms of taxonomic composition. Their reliability,
compared to other deposits, was also higher: a high
number of taxa were retrieved (see Fig. 5) whereas
taxon proportions between samples were also
established to be approximately the same (Asouti in
press). It thus seems likely that the charcoal from
midden samples is a reliable indicator of the relative
proportions of the different taxa used as fuel by the
Neolithic inhabitants of CH. Such consistency was
not achieved for samples deriving from short-lived
and/ or specialised context types (details on the
different preservation regimes encountered in CH
and their quantitative description are given in Asouti
in press).
woodland vegetation and exploitation
With the sole exception of wetland plants (e.g.
willow / poplar) all other tree and shrub taxa present
in the CH samples belong to drier vegetation types
such as oak park woodland, steppe and woodland
steppe (modelling of vegetation distributions was
based on soil maps, geomorphological and pollen
reconstructions, and modern vegetation analogues;
for full references to the sources used see Asouti and
Hather 2001;Asouti in press). The co-occurrence in
the archaeobotanical samples of fruits from the same
range of tree taxa, as well as independent evidence
for the long-distance procurement of game and
seasonal variations in grazing patterns (Fairbairn et
al. 2002;in press; Russell and Martin in press) suggest
a pattern of seasonal variations in resource exploitation that could have accommodated firewood collection as well, taking place at variable distances from
the settlement. That dung fuel was consistently used
alongside wood throughout the lifetime of the
settlement may further underline the relative distance
of the settlement from dry woodland vegetation (e.g.
oak park woodland). Distance therefore could have
hindered the exploitation of drier areas on a day-today basis. No direct evidence was obtained concerning fuel storage although it remains plausible:
deadwood (particularly from oak and wet woodland
species such as willow/poplar) was commonly
present, thus indicating non-destructive patterns of
woodland exploitation and/or at least some opportunistic exploitation of the local riverine environments (through the removal of dead vegetation in the
event of river floods). This factor may also be responsible for the lack of evidence for soil erosion and
large-scale deforestation in the local pollen diagrams
and sedimentary records covering the early-middle
Holocene period (cf. Roberts et al. 1996).
An important temporal change was observed in
the taxonomic composition of midden samples
approximately halfway through the lifetime of the

settlement (Fig. 5). This manifested as a clear increase in the presence and frequencies of oak charcoal
(much of it appearing in the form of deadwood) and
a simultaneous decrease of riverine taxa. The rise in
oak frequencies has been interpreted (based on the
charcoal, stratigraphic and off-site palaeoecological
evidence) as the result of the spatial expansion of
human activities on the hill zone, possibly due to the
overexploitation of the riverine vegetation (Asouti in
press), which is further suggested by other lines of
subsistence-related evidence (Russell and Martin in
press). Archaeological evidence from the same levels
has indicated that oak and juniper timbers were frequently re-used, and their abundance may also reflect
episodes of timber recycling (possibly when defunct
timber was used as fuel). Many of the less frequent
taxa were only present in the late (post-B,OOO BP)
assemblages, thus indicating a greater diversity of
collected wood species (see Fig. 5). The gradual
increase in the proportions of juniper and shrubs
(legumes, chenopods, labiates etc.) may also indicate
increasing human impact on the landscape (through
animal grazing on the plains and selective oak
logging on the hills) albeit one of relatively low
intensity compared to large-scale deforestation (cf
Asouti and Hather 2001; Asouti in press).

Conclusion
In closing this pa per we wish to emphasise the
following points:
•

•

•

Charcoal analysis is a viable methodology for
investigating past vegetation and its exploitation by
human societies, provided that the appropriate
sampling, subsampling and analytical procedures are
followed with due consideration of the settlement
pattern, context of deposition, and the duration and
types of activities associated with fuel use (domestic,
industrial etc.). Also important is evaluating the
likely post-depositional disturbances in sedimentary
matrices that may have been unfavourable to
charcoal preservation.
In most cases, charcoals retrieved from archaeological contexts are a product of purposeful human
action. In this they diverge crucially from off-site
pollen cores in that they present a composite picture
of local vegetation and related human activities
contemporary to the period of site use. These properties allow the detailed reconstruction of past
vegetation and people-environment interactions at
a timescale congruent with that of the human habitation.
Following from the previous point, as the examination of the ethnographic record and the review of
the archaeobotanical case studies indicate, at the
site level the environmental (availability, form and
distribution of woodland vegetation) and cultural

(subsistence economy) aspects of fuel collection and
consumption are interlinked. In order to attempt
long-term vegetation reconstructions, it would be
preferable to obtain fuel remains derived from long
stratified sequences or multiple sites belonging to
different periods, particularly when inferences about
regional climate change are sought from the charcoal record.
