Water management and labour in the
origins and dispersal of Asian rice
Dorian Q Fuller and Ling Qin

Abstract
Asian rice occurs in two wild types with diﬀering ecologies that would have necessitated rather
diﬀerent systems of exploitation among early hunter-gatherers and cultivators. The monsoonadapted ancestors of indica-like rice were readily gathered, whether unmanaged or managed
through simple burning regimes, and as such might be expected to have long been gathered or
cultivated without domestication. By contrast the perennial wetland rice that was ancestral to
japonica necessitated more intensive forms of management, especially in terms of water regimes, for
its productivity to be increased. This encouraged water-management systems that increased in
complexity and labour requirements over time and can be linked to the evolution of domestication
traits in Yangzte rice between 6000 and 4000 BC. The spread of rice from its Yangzte core seems to
have occurred after the development of paddy-ﬁeld cultivation systems. Meanwhile in India the
spread of rice out of the Ganges towards South India, mainly after 1000 BC, may also have occurred
only after more intensive irrigated systems of cultivation had developed. These are inferred from the
archaeological weed ﬂora of north India to have developed during the Chalcolithic to Iron Age (after
1400 BC). We suggest that the spread of rice, which has played an important role in models of
Neolithic population dispersal in Southeast Asia, may have been triggered by the development of
more intensive management systems and thus have required certain social changes towards
hierarchical societies rather than just rice cultivation per se.

Introduction
Rice is a highly productive crop, but this productivity is paid for with labour and water.
Rice is the staple crop of the world’s most populous countries, India and China, and the
most densely populated agricultural regions. For the most part these regions are
dominated by rice-paddy agriculture, in which landscapes are modiﬁed to retain water in

which rice can grow and to release water as rice plants come into full maturity. Thus the
management of water is central to rice agriculture, and in this paper we will consider the
ways in which water management may have been crucial to the domestication of rice, at
least in east Asia, and potentially to the delayed domestication elsewhere, such as in South
Asia. We will argue that it was the intersection of varying regional ecologies, and their
potential for producing wild rice, together with societies that were more or less prepared
for major labour investments that structured the process and timing of rice domestication.
Once established, the high productivity of rice agriculture may provide the surplus to fuel
population growth, and the demographic imperative of rice has been seen as causative to
population expansion and migration that shaped the cultural geography of Asia through
sequences of migrations, such as the Austronesian dispersal through Island Southeast Asia
(Bellwood 1997, 2005), the Austroasiatics through mainland Southeast Asia (Higham
2005; Bellwood 2005), and even the Sino-Tibetans/Sinitic in China and Burma (Van Driem
1998). But we will question whether it was the potential of rice per se, or the potential of
social systems, with suﬃcient population already, to mobilize the labour needed for rice
production.

Water in wild rice ecologies and foraging
In recent years traditional morphological taxonomy of the wild members of the sativacomplex has separated annual, more commonly self-pollinating forms adapted to the
seasonally drought-prone monsoon regions as Oryza nivara, keeping perennial wetland
forms as O. ruﬁpogon sensu stricto (Vaughan 1994; Plate 1). Some geneticists, however, use
Oryza ruﬁpogon (sensu lato) for both groups. While rice has a complex evolutionary
history it is clear that at a whole genome level indica and japonica are highly diverged

(Cheng et al. 2003; Garris et al. 2005; Londo et al. 2006; Vaughan et al. 2008). It has been
postulated on the basis of such genetic data, as well as archaeological evidence for rice
present in human economies by c. 7000/6000 BC in both Yangzte China (Lu 2006) and the
Ganges, India (Saxena et al. 2006; Saraswat 2005), that separate traditions of rice foraging
and early cultivation developed in these two regions (Fuller 2006: 39–46, 2007; Fuller et al.
2007). However, this is complicated by recent data indicating that a few key selected
domestication genes, including one of two that control panicle shattering (Li et al 2006;
Konishi et al 2006; Onishi et al 2007) and one that causes grains to be white (Sweeney et al.
2007), are shared across indica and japonica, with plausible origins with or after japonica
domestication. This can be explained either by separate origins of cultivation and
subsequent hybridization of cultivars (preferred by Kovach et al. 2007) or by rapid early
geographical dispersal and large-scale introgression from local wild populations in
Myanmar and India (Sang and Ge’s (2007) ‘snowball model’; Vaughan et al. 2008).
The two ecotypes of wild rice are expected to have provided diﬀering opportunities and
constraints for foragers and early farmers. O. nivara, as an annual grass, is adapted to
large-scale seed production, and as such would be an attractive resource for huntergatherers. It tends to grow in low-growing clumps and may be widespread on land that is
monsoon-inundated and then dried, including around lake edges in the elevations between
low-water and high-water shorelines (White 1995: 48). Ethnographically, groups which
utilize wild rice in eastern India visit stands when they are green and tie panicles into knots
to minimize the loss of grain to shattering; these tied plants can then be harvested by
pulling up of tied bundles (into which most early shattered spikelets have fallen), which
may or may not involve uprooting (cf. Vaughan et al. 2008: 395). Grain lost to shattering
ensures continuity of the wild populations, while harvested grains may be dried and
stored. Like the progenitors of the Near Eastern cereals, the annual habit makes these
attractive grain sources, and O. nivara tends towards self-pollination, which in theory
should lend itself to rapid domestication (Zohary 2004), if it were brought into cultivation,
especially on new plots of land free of the wild progenitor. On the other hand, the
potentially high productivity and predictability of this species in its natural habitat may
mean that it could be eﬀectively exploited in its wild state, which may have discouraged
intensive cultivation or translocation to new environments (for example, during lower
Mesolithic population densities of the early-mid Holocene Ganges). Simple management
might have taken the form of the removal of competing vegetation, such as by burning
during the dry season after wild rice grains were embedded safely in the soil. In this regard
it is worth noting that recent palynological studies in the Ganges plain indicate signiﬁcant
microcharcoal levels that suggest regular anthropogenic burning from the Terminal
Pleistocene warm period c. 14,500–13,000 BP at Sannai Tal through the early and midHolocene, with similar evidence from the end of the Pleistocene at Lahuradewa (Singh
2005; for site locations, Fig. 1). These charcoal levels from the terminal Pleistocene are
accompanied by the presence of Oryza bulliform phytoliths from c. 8000 BC, which show
increased levels and morphological diversity from c. 7000 BC (Saxena et al. 2006). Whether
some of these bulliforms represent cultivated rice, or not, requires further investigation.
By contrast, perennial Oryza ruﬁpogon is generally a less proliﬁc seed producer
(Vaughan et al. 2008; White 1995: 48). As a perennial that grows in permanently wet soils,
this species uses the strategy of perennial growth, through rhizomes and new tillers, to

persist. Grain production is often limited, and may be variable year to year. As such
O. ruﬁpogon may have provided unreliable wild grain sources, especially when growing in
ideal habitats with perennial water. Gathering these populations may have required
wading or even approaching them by boat. Under these conditions the natural shedding of
mature grain would have presented a particular challenge to foragers as it would not have
been easy to gather shed grain from the water or mud. We might expect this rice to have
been gathered opportunistically when available in wetland areas that would in any case
have been frequented in the late summer/post-monsoon season for gathering other regular
foods, such as water chestnuts (Trapa spp.) and foxnuts (Euryale ferox). An important
realization must have been that stands under more water-stressed conditions, where the
water table dried back, produced more seeds. This may have encouraged ﬁrst the planting
of rice seeds in more water-stressed conditions, and subsequently the manipulation of
water to create and extend such conditions. As White (1995: 58) argues, early rice
cultivation was more about management of environment than about individual plants.
Environmental manipulation to produce more rice may have involved several strategies,
but water control must have been one of them. We expect such manipulation to have
included clearing shallow wetland vegetation and adjacent vegetation, especially shadeproducing trees. Burning during the dry season might be one method. Burning would have
also facilitated the collection of acorns, by clearing undergrowth, as documented in
ethnohistoric sources on aboriginal California (Anderson 2005: 262). It is tempting to see
the pollen and microcharcoal evidence adjacent to the Kuahuqiao site as indicating this
(Zong et al. 2007), as archaeobotanical evidence indicates that both acorns and rice were
consumed (Fuller et al. 2007: table 1). However, as the evidence comes from only a single

sedimentary proﬁle, it is diﬃcult to extrapolate this accurately to a regional scale. Other
cores associated with archaeological sites in the region in the region include variable
evidence for burning (Atahan et al. 2008; locations indicated in Fig. 2). Thus
microcharcoal is consistently high from more than 8000 BC at Loujiang, and from c.
4000 BC at Qingpu. At the Guangfulin site low levels of burning are indicated from c. 5000
with a marked increase around 2400 BC (the Liangzhu period). Despite variability, this
implies a tradition of burning in the region since the early Holocene, and this can be
plausibly associated with early wild rice management. A further step would be to
manipulate drainage to encourage areas to be ﬂooded during the rainy season and dry out
at the end of summer. Such practices would be expected to increase Oryza ruﬁpogon grain
yields, probably including selection for genes involved with increased grain production
and decreased perenniality. One of the major contrasts between O. ruﬁpogon and O. sativa,
is that the cultivar is annual; and this change must have been selected for early in rice
management, perhaps even before domestication (in the strict sense).

Yangzte pre-domestication cultivation and early paddy-ﬁelds (to 4000

BC)

It remains problematic how early and how many times this domestication actually took
place (Fuller et al. 2007, 2008; Liu et al. 2007). There are a number of issues relating to the
status of rice ﬁnds, whether wild gathered, morphologically wild but cultivated or obligate
cultivars that are morphologically domesticated. Models of domestication have lacked
clear support from systematic archaeobotany, either in terms of large sampling
programmes with quantitative study or in terms of detailed documentation of
domesticated morphology. For example, there have been no analyses of weed ﬂoras that
might indicate cultivation, as has been documented in the Near East (Colledge 1998;
Hillman et al 2001; Willcox et al. 2008). There has also been no systematic study of rice
spikelet bases that preserve hard evidence for whether wild-type or domestic-type seed

dispersal was present (for criteria, see Thompson 1996; Fuller and Qin 2008), until recent
work in the Lower Yangzte (Zheng et al. 2007; Fuller and Qin 2008; Fuller et al. in press).
Less direct sources of evidence, such as changes in grain size/shape and phytolith
morphometrics, may nevertheless be taken as indicating directional evolutionary changes
in rice, and linked hypothetically to domestication processes. In Table 1, we outline a
hypothetical sequence from initial rice use by foragers through intensiﬁed use, cultivation,
domestication and agricultural intensiﬁcation, indicating expected archaeological indicators and where available interpret existing archaeological evidence in relation to them,
especially for the Lower Yangzte region. As the earliest stages of this, and the shift from
foraging to initial cultivation, remain obscure, we focus on the ﬁnal developments of the
domestication process.
This model for the evolution of domesticated rice in this region accepts that the process
was completed by c. 4000 BC (Fuller et al. 2007; Fuller and Qin 2008). Cultivation had
begun already by 6000 BC, indicated by the presence of a minority of domesticated rice
spikelet bases at Kuahuqiao (Zheng et al. 2007; but for other spikelet base identiﬁcation
criteria, see Fuller and Qin 2008). Subsistence at this time and through to 4500–4000 BC
was still heavily oriented towards wild gathered foods, of which acorns and Trapa water
chestnuts and foxnuts (Euryale ferox) featured prominently (Fuller et al. 2007). Animal
subsistence was focused on ﬁshing and hunting, although small numbers of domesticated
pigs were kept (Yuan et al. 2008). In addition to these wild resources, however, rice was
planted and cultivated, with gradual evolution towards a domesticated state (Fuller et al.
in press). Within the Lower Yangtze region there was a marked shift in rice-grain length,
but especially the more informative grain width, over time, both within one stratigraphic
sequence (at Lonqiuzhuang, with a transition around 4000) and within the Zhejiang/
Jiangsu region by contrasting grains from Kuahuqiao (6000–5400) with those from
Chuodun (c. 4300–4000) (Fuller et al. 2007). This shift in grain size is consistent with
morphological change under domestication, but it might also include some shift due to the
ability to harvest fully mature rice (with predominantly/wholly non-shattering/domesticated) panicles, on account of domestication. Other lines of evidence, including unﬁlled
spikelets and spikelet morphologies, also suggest that a proportion of the rice, perhaps c.
20–30 per cent, was being harvested before the grains had matured. In the same region
there was also a trend in the evolution of bulliform phytolith morphometrics, towards
larger sizes, with smaller bulliforms disappearing from assemblages after c. 4000 (Fuller
et al. 2007; cf. Zheng et al. 2004). Although the precise causes of this change in phytolith
size are unclear and require research, it can be suggested to include both directional
evolution (as by selection during domestication) and change in harvesting practices (such
as timing and/or harvest height). Taken together all these data ﬁt with an interpretation in
which rice was morphologically wild but under cultivation practices between 6000 and
4500 BC and subsequent to that came to be predominantly of domesticated morphology.
Correlated with these several morphological changes is evidence for an important
development in cultural practice: the creation of paddy-ﬁeld systems. Two sites east of
Taihu Lake of the Late Majiabang cultural period (4300–4000) have produced evidence
for ancient ﬁeld systems (Zou et al. 2000; Cao et al. 2006; Li et al. 2007a). First at
Ciaoxieshan and later at Chuodun, excavations have revealed the small artiﬁcial features
of ﬁeld units and connected canals and reservoirs dug into the natural sterile soil (Fig. 3).

96

Dorian Q Fuller and Ling Qin

Figure 3 Paddy-ﬁeld systems at Chuodun (after Cao et al. 2006).

Analyses on phytoliths, including high densities of rice-leaf bulliforms, and soil chemistry
match those expected from rice paddy-ﬁelds (Cao et al. 2006; Li et al. 2007a). The ﬁeld
units comprise small dugout features, with variable square or rectangular shapes, ranging
in size from roughly 1 square meter to approximately 15 square meters (Chuodun S27).
Such ﬁelds were then connected by channels to some deeper ‘water pits’ that are
interpreted as reservoirs in which water was retained. Water could be moved from the
reservoirs into the ﬁeld by bucket lifting, and surplus water could be allowed to ﬂow into
and out of ﬁelds through the interconnecting canals, as can be seen in a photograph from
the excavations at Chuodun (Plate 2).
These small ﬁelds would have allowed for tight control on water levels in small ﬁeld
units of rice. The layout of the ﬁelds appears more organic, rather than centrally planned,
and is tied to local topography. The small size of individual units, and excavation evidence
indicating that house units were dispersed among the ﬁeld systems, suggests a noncentralized household unit of production. While manipulation of the water table had
probably been important for increasing grain production in Oryza ruﬁpogon in earlier
periods, the late Majiabang ﬁeld systems would have ensured tight control of water levels,
thereby ensuring productivity. Another potentially important outcome of these ﬁeld
systems would have been the separation of cultivated and partially domesticated

populations from wild stands of rice, reducing cross-pollination and gene ﬂow, and thus
speeding up ﬁxation of domestication alleles, such as for non-shattering or thicker grains
(Fuller et al. 2007).
Evidence from the Middle Yangzte region suggests a number of parallels with the
Lower Yangzte. Although archaeobotanical data are far more limited, grain metrics
from Bashidang (7000–6000 BC) show a similar average and range as those from
Kuahuqiao (Fuller et al. 2007, 2008), whereas later grains from 4300–3500 show
signiﬁcant proportions of wider and longer grains, including some types at
Chengtoushan (Gu 2007) similar to those from Chuodun or from Longqiuzhuang
Layer 4. Chengtoushan also provides evidence for apparent rice-ﬁeld systems from its
Tangjiagang Culture (c. 4400) and Early Daxi period (c. 4300–4000) (Fig. 4; Hunan
Provincial Institute of Archaeology 2007: 164–7). This is perhaps slightly earlier than
those from the Lower Yangzte area. It is worth noting, however, that the nature of this
paddy ﬁeld is very diﬀerent from those of the Late Majiabang. Rather than small,
agglomerative ﬁeld units, the Chengtoushan ﬁeld is a long continuous ﬁeld for which the
ends were not found. It is demarcated on the east and west by linear embankments, with
a ﬁeld width of around 2.7 metres and a length of more than 20 metres (i.e. a ﬁeld area
of more than 54 square metres) (Fig. 4). This suggests involvement of a much larger
workgroup and a more communal/centralized organization of ﬁeld maintenance and
cultivation. Its association with a large walled settlement (Hunan Provincial Institute of
Archaeology 2007: 164–7; Yasuda et al. 2004) suggests a more centralized social system.
The diﬀerence from contemporaneous Lower Yangzte ﬁeld systems may suggest a
separate cultural tradition involved in the domestication of rice and the development of
rice systems.

distributional data indicate substantially more sites in the region around Tiahu Lake from
the Songze (4000–3300) and then the Liangzhu (3300–2200) periods (e.g. Tao et al. 2006:
ﬁg. 10). Cemetery sites indicate changes in social structure (Qin 2000, 2003). While a few
graves in the large cemeteries of the Majiabang period include some of the ﬁrst carved jade
in the region, there is little apparent diﬀerence in access to such wealth seen between
cemeteries or within cemeteries. One exception is the site of Lingjiatan, early Songze
period (Anhui Provincial Institute of Archaeology 2000, 2006), which is markedly richer
than any other site, and included distinctive jade ﬁgurines and ornaments. By the later
Songze period (c. 3500–3300), however, cemeteries had become smaller, with around 100
graves per cemetery, and within these cemeteries there are recurring patterns of diﬀerential
access to prestige objects such as jade ornaments and stone axes, and the total number of
ceramic vessels deposited in graves (Qin 2003).
Social diﬀerentiation became increasingly marked during the course of the Liangzhu
period (from 3300), with increasing regional population density and craft specialization,
especially evident in the production of prestige jade objects (Qin 2003, 2006). Cemeteries
in this period became signiﬁcantly smaller and more exclusive. Groups of graves
generally number between twenty and forty. The cemeteries occur in two types, those
dug into specially prepared clay platforms (e.g. Luodun site: see Suzhou Museum 1999)
and those dug adjacent to houses (e.g. Puanqiao site: see Archaeology Department of
Peking University et al. 1998). By the mid Liangzhu period (3000 BC) it is clear from
burial objects that the platform cemeteries have particular access to wealth, including
large numbers of jade objects produced by a very limited number of specialized
production centres that were probably linked to distinct, and controlled, geological jade
sources (e.g. Fanshan Site: see Zhejiang Province Institute of Archaeology 2005a; Qin
2003, 2006). The richest platform cemeteries are clearly located at the key regional
centres, much as proto-urban Liangzhu itself (Zhejiang Province Institute of Archaeology 2005b). By this period sites were widely distributed across the landscape, and with
quite small habitation structures located on low anthropogenic mounds. This pattern
suggests a high density of farmers practising more intensive agriculture, such as by
plough.
These social changes are accompanied by evidence for intensiﬁcation of rice agriculture.
In the later Songze period and Liangzhu phase, the ﬁrst stone plough tips occur, indicating
more intensive cultivation methods. The earliest plough tips are from a mid to late Songze
period cemeteries (see Administration of Cultural Heritage of Shanghai 1985; Zhejiang
Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology 2006). Stone plough tips become
more common and larger over the course of the Liangzhu period. Still mysterious is who
or what pulled the ploughs, as there remains no clear evidence for domesticated buﬀalos
(cf. Yuan et al. 2008; Yang et al. 2008), and it may be that labouring people pulled these.
There are also later developments towards more eﬀective harvesting methods. The ﬁrst
clear sickles, or harvest knives, in the Lower Yangtze date from the Liangzhu period
(Chang 1986: 256–2). Recent excavations at the site of Chenghu (Songze period) also
suggest some changes in the construction of individual paddy-ﬁelds (Ding 2007). Some
ﬁeld units have become much larger than those from earlier Caoxieshan or Chuodun
(nearly 100 square metres), and ﬁelds appear to be aligned in a more regular terrace-like
fashion (Fig. 5). This may indicate that some agricultural groups were able to mobilize
larger workforces for ﬁeld construction. In this regard is it interesting that some sites start

In the mid Yangtze area, sedentary settlements ﬁrst appeared during the Pengtoushan
period (8000–6000). At the Bashidang site, from the later part of this period, an encircling
moat and wall were excavated, as well as living and storage areas, and a cemetery. But
there is no evidence for social diﬀerentiation within the community or between sites. In the

regular ones began to be apparent. Chengtoushan and Yinxiangcheng sites are both more
than 100,000 square metres, and can be regarded as larger, central sites (Zhang 2003).
Chengtoushan site has a wide moat and wall, expanded four times during the occupation.
So far the only paddy-ﬁeld feature in the mid Yangtze area has been found at this site,
belonging to pre-Daxi levels beneath the earliest wall, and another possible ﬁeld from the
early Daxi period (Hunan Provincial Institute of Archaeology 2007; Yasuda et al.
2004: 150).
Rapid social change and rearrangement of regional settlement patterns all happened at
the next stage, the Qujialing culture. A series of city-sites appeared in this period and
continued to be used until the early and mid Shijihe phases (2800–2400 BC), when the sites
can be divided into three or four distinct levels (cf. Zhang 2003; Yasuda et al. 2004: 155–6).
Shijiahe, a central proto-urban site, is about one million square metres. It produced many
ﬁgurines and hundreds of thousands of ritual vessels (a red cup type) in one area of the
site. This social diﬀerentiation continued to intensify from the Qujialing to the early
Shijiahe period, similar to contemporary developments of the Liangzhu culture in Lower
Yangzte, until these processes were interrupted by the expansion of inﬂuence of the late
Longshan period (from 2300) of the central plain. At the moment, no direct evidence
documents the role of rice agriculture over this period in the middle Yangzte, but it is
likely that the increase of population, the development of specialization and the
organization of labour for public construction imply rapid development of agricultural
societies in this area. This became possible only after the establishment of a rice-paddy
system in the earlier Daxi period.
It was only after systematic cultivation of domesticated rice populations was
established, perhaps from c. 4000, that we ﬁnd evidence for the spread of rice beyond
its Yangzte core (Ruddiman et al. 2008). By, or after, 3000 BC rice as a crop had spread to
many sites in the Yellow river basin (Li et al. 2007b; Lee et al 2007; Fuller and Zhang 2007;
Jin et al. 2007), Taiwan (Bellwood 2005: 134) and possibly to Korea (Ahn 2004). The
earlier ﬁnds of this rice dispersal go back into the fourth millennium BC, as at Shixia in
Guangdong (Zhang et al. 2006, 2007), South China and Nanjiaokou in Henan (Wei et al.
2000). Although there are a few even earlier ﬁnds of rice, older than 6000, at Jiahu and
Yuezhuang, these do not seem to form a continuous tradition of cultivation, and have
been suggested to be wild (Fuller et al. 2007, 2008). This spread of labour-intensive paddyﬁeld cultivation systems over large areas of East Asia then appears to have occurred
rapidly once full domestication and intensive cultivation was established (during the Late
Majiabang period). It is probably no coincidence that this spread of paddy-ﬁeld
cultivation correlated with an unexpected rise in global methane levels that started after
3000 BC, and for which rice-paddy agriculture is a likely source (Ruddiman et al. 2008).
The long-distance dispersal of rice and farming from Taiwan into Island Southeast Asia
(Bellwood 1997) and through the river valleys of mainland Southeast Asia proceeded from
this period, reaching central Thailand and Cambodia by c. 2000 (Higham 2005). But
rather than marking the beginnings of rice cultivation and agriculture per se this
process seems to happen after the integration of fully domesticated rice and labourintensive paddy-ﬁeld systems that relied on increasingly hierarchical labour mobilization
strategies.

State formation and the spread of indica rice in South Asia
South Asian archaeologists generally accept that indica rice was domesticated in the
Ganges plain (e.g. Allchin and Allchin 1997: 94–8; Chakrabarti 1999: 205–7; Possehl 1999:
246–8), although disparities remain as to when and where it was under cultivation and
when domesticated (for sites, see Fig. 1). Possehl concluded that cultivation ‘preceding the
Mature Harappan cannot be supported on current evidence’ (1999: 246), while Allchin
and Allchin cautioned that ‘there may have been long periods when people collected and
consumed the seeds of wild rice’ (1997: 97). Nevertheless, the possibility of much earlier
rice cultivation has been raised again recently based on new, well-dated ﬁnds from the site
of Lahuradewa (Tewari et al. 2006; Saraswat 2005; Saxena et al. 2006), which include
AMS dates on Oryza grains back to c. 6400 BC and the earliest ceramics in South Asia. It
remains uncertain, however, whether this rice was gathered or cultivated, and there is no
hard morphological evidence that it is of domesticated type (Fuller 2006, 2007). Tewari
et al. (2006: 49) argue that some of the grains resemble domesticated type while others are
of weedy/wild types, but more data are needed.
Later evidence from the region, such as Lahuradewa period 1B and Senuwar Period 2
(Saraswat 2005), suggests that rice was a major food resource, probably cultivated, before
crops from other regions were adopted, most notably free-threshing wheat and barley
adopted in the region between 2400 and 2200. From this period and into the early second
millennium BC, agriculture is not in doubt, including both native species and introduced
cultivars; after 2000 peninsular Indian cultivars were adopted, such as mung bean and
horsegram (Fuller 2006). Earlier cultivation of rice by c. 3000–2600 is implied by recent
ﬁnds beyond its probable wild zone at Early Harappan Kunal (Saraswat and Pokharia
2003), and perhaps the third millennium in the Swat valley of Pakistan (Costantini 1987).
The available morphometric evidence for Neolithic Gangetic rice (collected in Harvey
2006) indicates that grains are on the small side, congruent with morphologically wild rice,
and perhaps immature grains, being present. All of this evidence could be seen as
indicating a long history of cultivation and/or gathering of morphologically wild rice in
the Ganges, with the evolution of non-shattering forms occurring quite late after the
introduction of domesticated japonica rice carrying the key mutations, especially the
recessive sh4 allele, and perhaps the white pericarp rc mutation (cf. Kovach et al. 2007;
Sweeney and McCouch 2007).
What is striking in the Indian archaeobotanical record, however, is the rapid spread of
rice in the second and ﬁrst millennia BC (see Fuller 2002: 316, ﬁg. 7). In north-western
South Asia, including the greater Indus valley, Gujarat and Rajasthan, secure ﬁnds of rice
date from the Late Harappan period (cf. Fuller 2002; Kharakwal et al. 2007). Based on
grain-shape ratios (Costantini 1979, 1987) and bulliform phytoliths (Fujiwara 1993; Sato
2005), however, this rice appears to include japonica types, which may indicate diﬀusion
from China via central Asia by this period (also suggested by the occurrence of Panicum
miliaceum, Cannabis and harvest knives in the Late Neolithic of Kashmir (Fuller 2006:
36)). By the start of the second millennium rice cultivation was also established in Orissa,
although better evidence for a mixed agricultural system, including peninsular
Indian pulses and rice, dates from the mid-second millennium (Harvey et al. 2006;
Harvey 2006).

Water management in the origins and dispersal of Asian rice

Further south, in the Deccan, however, rice cultivation takes oﬀ in the Iron Age. Earlier
ﬁnds are few and problematic, including three grains in the Late Jorwe at Inamgaon
(Kajale 1988) and plausibly wild grains in low numbers at Hallur in Karnataka (Fuller
2003: 378). However, from Iron Age and Megalithic sites along the eastern peninsula, such
as Bhagimohari and Veerapuram, it is clear that rice had been adopted as a major crop
(Kajale 1984, 1989), while further south rice-husk-tempered pottery and systematic
archaeobotany from sites in southern inland Tamil Nadu indicate the establishment of rice
cultivation before the end of the ﬁrst millennium BC (Cooke et al. 2005; Fuller 2006: 53–5).
In central India the spread of rice has been attributed to the spread of elite-supported
Buddhist establishments and urbanism, and it is associated with major irrigation works
(Shaw and Sutcliﬀe 2003; Shaw et al. 2007).
Similarly, the spread of rice in the south is associated in the emergence of Tamil city
states, around the hinterland of which craft crops like cotton were also cultivated. Cotton
had already been adopted into a South Deccan agriculture based on a range of monsoonadapted savannah millets and pulses. In the case of southern India, rice appears to
have been adopted by established, Dravidian-speaking groups (Fuller 2007), and its
adoption was connected to new forms of food consumption (Fuller 2005: 769), presumably
as rice was a high-status food (Smith 2006). The spread of rice thus indicated the social
readiness to deploy more labour-intensive agriculture and the expansion of tank-based
irrigation.
The roots of this South Indian rice lay in the earlier Ganges region or Orissa, and
evidence from the weed ﬂora suggests that it was the development of irrigated rice that may
have been crucial. Table 2 summarizes the archaeobotanical evidence for a selected roster of
weed species, including those which are plausibly summer weeds of rice, and indicating a
division into those which are typical of wetland or irrigated rice and those which are more
likely associated with dry cultivation or upland rice. What can be seen is an overall increase
in the number of weed species, but in particular an increasing frequency of occurrence of
wetland weeds, while the only species that seem to disappear with time are dryland species
(Silene, Ischaemum) or the perennial Coix (which should decrease with more intensive
ploughing). Available data are limited but nevertheless suggest a diversiﬁcation of
cultivation regimes including an increase in irrigated/wetland cultivation.

Discussion: implications for agricultural dispersal models
Our current understanding of rice domestication suggests key diﬀerences from conventional accounts. First the beginnings of rice agriculture were gradual, the domestication
process was slow and ﬁnished signiﬁcantly later than often assumed. Over the course of the
Chinese Neolithic nut-gatherers switched to being farmers, certainly by 4500–4000 BC. In
the Ganges plain groups were also using rice by 7000, but between this time and better
evidence for agriculture from 2500–2000, we have little evidence from which to infer
cultivation practices or the evolution of rice domestication traits. Once domesticated, rice
seems to have spread rapidly, especially through East and Southeast Asia, although it was
not merely rice that spread but systems of labour-intensive cultivation. This may indicate
that, rather than the beginnings of agriculture per se, it was the development of certain

social systems that could mobilize labour to create paddy-ﬁeld systems and/or irrigation
works that was the key transition. The creation of these paddy-ﬁeld systems may also have
been a tipping point in the rice domestication process in East Asia. Similarly in South Asia,
the period which saw the major spread of rice, during the Iron Age, may be one that was
linked to the development and spread of more labour-intensive irrigated rice systems, such
as the tank systems documented in central India (Shaw and Sutcliﬀe 2003; Shaw et al. 2007)
and the presumably tank-irrigated rice of the later Iron Age of Tamil Nadu (Cooke et al.
2005). In peninsular India, especially the Dravidian south, it is clear that rice was adopted
into existing systems of cultivation and that population movement was not involved in its
dispersal; see the linguistic evidence (Fuller 2007).
Labour-intensive forms of rice cultivation would have been highly productive, and can
be suggested to have fuelled demographic expansion, but it may well be that it was the
social changes towards hierarchy and new means of labour organization that were the
turning point in the development and expansion of rice agriculture. Rather than
attributing population spread and growth merely to the possession of rice, as implied by
Bellwood (2005) or Higham (2005), it is necessary to factor in the social system and how
labour was deployed to control and manipulate water. Rice, unlike the cereals of the Near
East, followed a trajectory into cultivation and domestication in which the manipulation
of water and the deployment of intensive agriculture were central.
