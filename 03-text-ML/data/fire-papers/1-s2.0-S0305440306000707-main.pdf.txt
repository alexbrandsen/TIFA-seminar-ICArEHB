Abstract
In the Pacific region, the onset of modern El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity at approximately 5000 years ago may have played
a significant role in the development of cultures in the Pacific basin. Within Australia, similar trends in population and resource use have been
identified but largely ascribed to cultural changes. To test human responses to changing ENSO activity through the Holocene we analysed a comprehensive suite of 710 radiocarbon ages from archaeological sites in ENSO-sensitive Queensland. We observe a dramatic and sustained increase
in landscape activity at inland sites from 4860  15 years ago, statistically indistinguishable from the timing of the onset of modern ENSO
activity. Subsequent changes in long-term activity directly impacted on human populations indicating that once established, ENSO maintained
a continuous influence on disparate cultures throughout the Pacific basin.

1. Introduction
The changing dynamics of the atmosphereeocean system
driven by the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has
received considerable research interest in attempting to understand past climatic, environmental and archaeological changes
[9,12,22,27]. Major climatic perturbations associated with
the ENSO phenomenon are known to have taken place at
a range of different timescales, including the last glaciale
interglacial cycle [30,31], the mid-Holocene [10], and in the
recent past [15,23]. In the Pacific region, the onset of modern
ENSO activity appears to have commenced approximately
5000 years ago [18,20,25], thousands of years after human
populations became established over much of the region
[1,19,20,28,32].

Forcing changes in human settlement and resource use, the
onset of ‘modern’ ENSO activity may have played a significant
role in the development of eastern Pacific cultures [27,29].
Within Australia, similar trends in population and resource
use have been identified but largely ascribed to cultural
changes, such as stone tool development, economic intensification, changes in settlement patterns and/or exploitation of
seashore resources [16,21,27]. Although these all have merit
in explaining different aspects of the Australian archaeological
record, the potential role of environmental change in contributing to these developments has been often neglected or relegated to a minor role (for exceptions see [8,12,26]).
During El Niño episodes, a northward movement of the
Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone and a northeastward
migration of the South Pacific Convergence Zone results in
a significant decrease in summer precipitation (typically
150e300 mm below seasonal average) over much of Queensland [5,11,18], making it extremely sensitive to changes in
ENSO activity. Furthermore, Queensland has a rich archaeological record spanning over 35,000 years [6] that has been

C.S.M. Turney, D. Hobbs / Journal of Archaeological Science 33 (2006) 1744e1748

extensively radiocarbon dated since the 1960s, providing an
excellent opportunity to test hypotheses regarding human responses to ENSO variability in the southwest Pacific region.
2. Methods
A principal indicator of mid-Holocene change in Australian
Aboriginal activity is the significant increase in the number of
radiocarbon ages reported from archaeological contexts. Although this has often been interpreted as reflecting a major
population increase [21], it is unlikely that a simple relationship exists between population and the number of radiocarbon
ages. Although a precise interpretation is probably not possible, the increased number of ages from the mid-Holocene
most probably reflects greater activity in the landscape [12,17];
something that does not preclude an increase in population. Individual sites and the generally limited number of associated
radiocarbon ages, however, make it difficult to precisely date
the onset of increased activity and test whether the timing
was synchronous within and across Australia. Where compilations of radiocarbon ages have been investigated they have
largely been undertaken on an uncalibrated timescale
[12,17], precluding robust comparisons to independentlydated reconstructions of change outside Australia.
To test human responses to changing ENSO activity
through the Holocene [20] we analysed a comprehensive suite
of radiocarbon ages obtained from Queensland archaeological
contexts (Fig. 1) [33,34]. A total of 710 radiocarbon ages were
calibrated to 2s using the IntCal04 and Marine04 datasets [24]
with a Southern Hemisphere offset of 40  13 years and the
probabilities of individual age distributions for the separate
categories summed and normalised to unit area using
CALIB5. Sites were independently categorised as inland and

1745

coastal (<1 km from present day coastline) [33,34], with the
latter separated according to marine (e.g. marine shells) or terrestrial (e.g. charcoal) as a measure of resource use. No selection criteria were used for the available radiocarbon ages; the
large number in this study precludes significant skewing of the
dataset and provides an excellent opportunity to identify longterm trends. For marine samples, the ages were calibrated
against Marine04 with a DR for the east central Australian
coast of 12  6 years. All ages are given as calibrated years
before AD 1950.
3. Holocene changes in landscape activity and ENSO
variability
Elevated probability values from 4860  15 years ago indicate a marked increase in landscape activity at inland sites
(Fig. 2A), possibly as a result of a significant expansion in
the Aboriginal population. Prior to this time, relatively little
activity is recognised, which we interpret to reflect a low population density. Activity at coastal locations occurs significantly later in time, however. A small change in probability
values at coastal locations characterised by a dominance of
terrestrial resource use is broadly coincident with the time of
inland expansion (Fig. 2B) but only significantly increases
from 3210  10 years ago. In contrast, coastal locations characterised by a dominance of marine resource use (Fig. 2C) are
not intensively utilised until much later, with the first significant sustained period of increase commencing around
2140 years ago and culminating 1400 years ago. From this
time, there is an almost exponential expansion in activity in
both inland and coastal locations (Fig. 2). Differences in the
timing of expansion recognised here as a result of sampling
bias can be discounted. Any continental shelf population

increase prior to the mid-Holocene would have generated the
opposite pattern to that observed following sea level stabilisation in the region 5800 years ago [14].
Summing the probabilities of the different site locations
(Fig. 3), we find that the increase in Queensland values is statistically indistinguishable from the onset of modern ENSO
conditions reported for the mid-Holocene [20]. The timing

4. Potential effects of ENSO activity on resource
exploitation
An increased frequency of ‘warm’ ENSO events from the
mid-Holocene appears to have led to a considerable increase
in activity in the landscape. A shift to more frequent ENSO
activity would have led to drier conditions across Queensland
[5], implying a reduction in the carrying capacity of the
land. There are several mechanisms, however, by which subsistence strategies may have been adapted to effect greater resource exploitation. An increased frequency of ‘warm’ ENSO
events in the mid-Holocene would have greatly increased the
efficacy of using fire as a regime for managing the inland landscape of Queensland, improving hunting success rates and

C.S.M. Turney, D. Hobbs / Journal of Archaeological Science 33 (2006) 1744e1748

regenerating plant food [8]. In areas of rainforest, expansion of
this vegetation type would have been limited from this time.
The drier conditions in combination with increased burning
in the landscape would have led to the fragmentation and
opening up of rainforest [18] and increased the populations
of certain marsupial species [13] potentially allowing greater
exploitation of a resource not previously used significantly
by indigenous peoples. Such a scenario is consistent with
the mid-Holocene development of the first Australian rainforest culture populations at this time [3]. The implied role of
ENSO activity suggests that Australian Aboriginal tropical
rainforest culture developed independently of other Pacific
areas as an adaptation to changing environmental conditions.
With the onset of modern ENSO activity and the adaptation
of subsistence strategies, a considerably greater expansion appears to have taken place, implying increasing movement of
people across the landscape. Strategic lessons were probably
learnt in resource exploitation to sustain a continued expansion
that eventually translated into greater colonization and exploitation of coastal locations. The increased use of coastal areas
occurred at broadly the same time as subsequent changes
recorded at inland locations, suggesting an ENSO link.
Resource-rich coastal locations, such as mangroves, had
developed significantly earlier than the changes reported
here [4] but the onset of modern ENSO activity would have
resulted in reduced flooding [9] and muted changes in daily
sea level [2,7]. These might have allowed longer periods for
more sustained exploitation of the inter-tidal zone that were
sufficient to support intensified activity in these areas.
Although strategic lessons must have been learnt, periodic
changes in ENSO after 5000 years ago appear to have been
sufficient to have directly impacted on the activity in the landscape. During periods of reduced ENSO activity, there are substantial decreases in the probability distribution of calibrated
radiocarbon ages (Fig. 3), implying less need to forage as
widely across the landscape at these times.
Aboriginal populations therefore appear to have successfully
adapted to and exploited changing ENSO variability, utilising
larger areas of land and resulting in greater activity in the landscape. Future work is now critical to refine the selection and calibration of radiocarbon datasets to determine whether such
patterns are manifested across Australia, particularly during
earlier periods of known changing ENSO activity [6,31].
5. Conclusions
The onset of modern El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
activity at approximately 5000 years ago is believed to have
played a significant role in the development of cultures in
the eastern Pacific basin, but is largely discounted when interpreting change in the Australian archaeological record. By
analysing Queensland radiocarbon dated archaeological
sequences as a proxy of Aboriginal activity in the landscape,
we show a dramatic and sustained increase coincided with
the onset of modern ENSO activity. The increasingly variable
climate appear to have forced populations to develop new and
varied strategies for survival and unwittingly this may have

1747

provided the necessary platform to enable populations to
more efficiently extract energy from the environment, potentially supporting a larger population. Subsequent changes mirror ENSO variability and indicate that once established, ENSO
maintained a continuous influence on populations throughout
the Pacific basin.
