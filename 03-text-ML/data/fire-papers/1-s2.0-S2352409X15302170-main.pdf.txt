Recent exploratory drilling at Abric Romaní reveals that carbonate tufas similar to the archeologically rich levels
excavated to date extend at least 30 m beneath the current base of excavation. The present project focused on
sampling and measuring a suite of new U-series dates on core samples to determine whether reliable dates
could be obtained from the older tufas and, if so, their temporal extent.
Using relatively small (~100 mg), carefully selected samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, we obtained a total of 20 dates for 10 core samples and one sample near the base of the current excavation. Corrections for thorium from contaminating detritus were generally negligible, as indicated by a median
230
Th/232Th activity ratio of 360. At selected levels in the sequence, two or three coeval samples were prepared
and analyzed in order to determine the reproducibility of their dates. Reproducibility at most levels was similar
to analytical errors, consistent with rapid carbonate deposition followed by evolution of closed U–Th systems. In
contrast in the sample nearest the base of the core, scatter of dates beyond analytical errors was observed among
sub-samples, probably indicating failure of the U–Th system to remain closed.
The dates, which preserve stratigraphic order in all cases, range from ~55 ka for a sample from level N of the
existing excavation to ~110 ka at the base of the core. The new dates show that tufas at Abric Romaní extend
at least to early Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. Mean accumulation rates in the core varied widely, from a minimum of 17 cm/ka during the later parts of MIS 5 to a maximum of 130 cm/ka during the Last Interglacial in
early MIS 5, suggesting that a wetter hydroclimate prevailed in the region during periods of low global ice volume. The new dates show that burned travertine and sand intersected by the drill-core, which are likely indicators of human presence, are as old as ~100 ka. Thus, evidence for human presence at Abric Romaní now extends
over ~60 thousand years.

1. Introduction
1.1. Site history and character
Abric Romaní is the best known of a series of rock shelters along the
Cingles del Capelló cliff, near Capellades, some 45 km west of Barcelona
(Fig. 1, location map). The exposed section at Abric Romaní consists of
over 17 m of carbonate tufas that contain Mousterian occupation levels
rich in animal bone, tools, and charcoal. The deposit was discovered in

1909 by Amador Romaní who carried out intermittent excavations
over the succeeding 20 years. In 1956 E. Ripoll, H. de Lumley, and G. Laplace resumed excavations that continued until 1962. This later excavation extended into the ﬁrst few meters of the Mousterian, the industry
of which was attributed to the Denticulate facies (de Lumley and
Ripoll, 1962), while the Upper Paleolithic artifacts were attributed to
the Gravettian and Aurignacian (Laplace, 1962; Soler, 1986; Vaquero,
1992). The present program of research is a large-scale interdisciplinary
project initiated in 1983 under the direction of Carbonell et al. (1985);
Mora et al. (1988); and Muro et al. (1987). Sixteen archeological levels
have been excavated thus far (from A to P) and additional archeological
layers below the current surface of the main excavation are exposed in a
hand-dug test pit known as the Romaní well. All the exposed and excavated archeological horizons correspond to the Middle Paleolithic, except the uppermost level A, attributed to the Early Upper Paleolithic.
Unfortunately these upper levels were almost totally removed by

Amador Romaní and are poorly known. Most of the available
archeological observations come from levels comprehensively excavated since 1983 with a surface area of more than 200 m2. The excavation
of such a large area combined with the high temporal resolution of the
archeological units has provided a picture of the spatial organization
strategies of the Middle Paleolithic occupants. The occupations apparently focused around well-preserved hearths that form a clustered distribution on most archeological levels (Vaquero, 1999; Pastó et al.,
2000; Vaquero and Pastó, 2001). Thus, it seems that Abric Romaní was
essentially a residential campsite.
Most lithic remains come from reduction sequences carried out on
the spot in well-deﬁned knapping areas. The characteristics of the lithic
assemblages suggest marked technological changes throughout the sequence. The oldest levels so far excavated (O and P) exhibit an elaborated technology based on the use of the Levallois method, including
strategies for bladelet production in level P. Levels M to I show an expedient technical behavior, in which discoidal knapping is dominant. Hierarchical Levallois-like methods are again more common at the upper
Middle Paleolithic levels. Denticulates and notches are dominant
throughout the Middle Paleolithic sequence, although the percentage
of sidescrapers tends to increase at the youngest levels (from level E upwards). Finally, both technology and typology indicate a clear discontinuity between the Middle Paleolithic and the overlying Early Upper
Paleolithic of archeological level A (Vaquero, 1992).
Horse and Cervus elaphus (red deer) are the dominant fauna of all
the archeological levels, although minor Bovidae and Rhinocerotidae
bones are found in some layers. Zooarcheological and taphonomic analysis have shown that faunal assemblages were primarily anthropogenic
(Cáceres, 1998; Cáceres et al., 1998).
In addition, Abric Romaní has provided abundant charcoal fragments from hearths that are dominated by Pinus sylvestris (Scotch
pine), reﬂecting open woodland during cold and dry climate phases
(Burjachs and Julià, 1994, 1996; Allue et al., 1996). Moreover, tufa deposits covering most of the archeological levels allow the preservation
of wood imprints. This has made it possible to document the use of
wood by Neanderthals, both as fuel and raw material for artifact

manufacture (Carbonell and Castro-Curel, 1992; Castro-Curel and
Carbonell, 1995; Solé et al., 2013).
1.2. Previous dating
The moss-generated carbonate tufas of Abric Romaní are highly suitable for U-series dating (Bischoff et al., 1988a). Initial isotopic analysis of
this material yielded a series of 20 dates in correct stratigraphic order
that placed the upper 13 m of the sequence in the period between 60
and 40 ka. Over the intervening years additional samples have been
dated as ongoing excavations have exposed new areas. These dates include those obtained for the Mousterian–Aurignacian boundary exposed at the top of the sequence that ﬁrmly established its age as
43 ± 1 ka, thereby conﬁrming the great antiquity of the Aurignacian
in northern Spain and providing an early calibration point for the radiocarbon calibration curve (Bischoff et al., 1994). Recently, Higham et al.
(2014) have suggested a diachronous replacement of the Mousterian
by technologies associated with anatomically modern humans across
Europe during the interval from ca. 45 to 41 ka, placing the Mousterian–Aurignacian boundary at Abric Romaní near the beginning of the regional transition. Dates from Abric Romaní reported in Vaquero et al.
(2013) include those from the Romaní well, which extends ca. 6.4 m
below the current excavation ﬂoor and yields dates mostly in the
range from ~55 to 60 ka.
1.3. Drilling results and sampling of core
Core drilling was carried out in late May of 2010 in square P58 on the
current excavation surface of level P (13 m below datum; see Fig. 2,
photo and plan view of drill site). This location is considered to be at
or near the center of carbonate tufa deposition between the wall and
the drip line of the rock shelter in an area least exposed to alteration.
Continuous core, 4 cm in diameter, was obtained down to 47 m below
the datum and showed largely original depositional textures with little
visible alteration (Fig. 3, core log). Notably, the presence in the core of
burned travertine and sand at depths from ~ 13 to 18 m is strong

evidence of human presence at the site at levels far below the current
excavations. The core will also provide a record of past regional vegetation changes through time via pollen analysis (cf. Burjachs and Julià,
1994).
Twelve samples were cut from the 30 m of core using a rock saw. We
selected one additional sample from the wall of the excavation about a
meter above the current excavation ﬂoor (sample N). The selected intervals preserved primary depositional texture and included minimal
secondary inﬁlling of primary porosity. Based on visual criteria, the

samples are generally of high quality for U-series dating; that is, they
consist of micro-crystalline carbonate with primary algal structures
and show no evidence of recrystallization, secondary cementation, or
detrital contamination (Fig. 4, photo of drill core).
2. Analytical methods
U–Th isotopes in the tufas were analyzed via inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in the U-Daughter Lab of the

size pieces were hand selected under a binocular microscope and further cleaned by repeated cycles of ultrasonic treatment in de-ionized
water followed by alcohol.
Samples were totally dissolved in HNO3, equilibrated with a mixed
spike containing 229Th, 233U, and 236U. U and Th were isolated and puriﬁed using two steps of anion exchange chemistry. Samples were then
treated with perchloric acid to remove any remaining organic material.
Samples were analyzed as mixed U–Th solutions. Minor isotopes
(230Th and 234U) were measured sequentially on an ion counter while
232
Th, 235U, and 238U were measured on Faraday collectors. All isotopes
are measured relative to 238U to normalize any beam instabilities. Measured ratios were corrected for mass bias (using the known 233U/236U
ratio of the spike), minor amounts of naturally occurring U and Th
isotopes present in the spike, and element-speciﬁc ion counter yields
(by cycling 229Th and 233U between in the ion counter and Faraday).
Correction was also made for instrumental backgrounds (measured
prior to each sample, while aspirating the same high purity 2% HNO3 solution used to introduce samples), the effects on minor isotopes of the
peak-tails of more abundant isotopes (using measurements at six halfmass positions interpolated using a double exponential ﬁt), and isobaric
interferences produced by hydrides of U and Th (e.g., 229Th1H+ on
230
Th; using a tail-corrected measurement of the 238U1H+/238U ratio,
scaled to the other U and Th peaks).
The spike used was created by gravimetrically mixing near monoisotopic 233U and 236U solutions obtained from the New Brunswick Laboratory (NBL) with high purity 229Th. The 229Th concentration of the
spike was determined by analyzing solutions consisting of spike
mixed with 69 Ma Schwartzwalder Mine (SCH) uranium ore that yields
concordant U–Pb ages (Ludwig et al., 1985) and uniform 230Th/238U and
234
U/238U ratios for sub-samples, and is therefore considered to have
230
Th/238U and 234U/238U ratios in secular equilibrium. SCH solutions
were analyzed in every analytical session in order to monitor reproducibility. Accuracy of U isotope ratios was monitored by frequent analyses
of NBL CRM 145, which yields a mean 234U/238U ratio of (5.2910 ±
0.0020) × 10−5, within uncertainty of the certiﬁed value of (5.2841 ±
0.0082) × 10− 5. Activity ratios and ages were calculated using the
decay constants for 234U and 230Th of Cheng et al. (2000). Ages and errors were calculated using Isoplot/Ex 3.75 (Ludwig, 2010). During the
course of our study new 234U and 230Th decay constants consistent
with previous values though with smaller errors were published

(Cheng et al., 2013), however, we retain the earlier values for consistency with the existing literature.
3. Results
We analyzed ten samples distributed down the length of the core
and one sample from archeological level N of the excavation, about
one meter above the current ﬂoor. To evaluate the reproducibility of
the new dates and thereby aid in assessing their reliability, we analyzed
multiple fractions of ﬁve samples. These include the sample from level N
of the excavation and core-samples 1, 4, 5, and 12, making a total of 20
analyses in all. Depths of the dated samples, U–Th isotopic data, and derived ages are given in Table 1.
The analytical data indicate that the samples are generally highly
suitable for U-series dating. Median concentrations of uranium and thorium are, respectively, 770 μg/kg and 8 μg/kg. The relatively low Th concentration indicates that the samples contain very little alumino-silicate
detritus, and the median (230Th/232Th)act of 360 indicates that corrections for initial 230Th (using 232Th as an index of detrital contamination)
are generally quite minor. Corrected ages include a model correction for
initial 230Th derived from silicate detritus while uncorrected ages do
not; thus, their difference indicates the magnitude of the model correction applied to each sample.
The new ages range from ~ 55 to 110 ka and are plotted against
depth in Fig. 5. New dates for two fractions of the sample from excavation level N of 54.91 ± 0.07 and 55.08 ± 0.07 ka (errors are 1σ) are in
close mutual agreement and are similar to previously published Useries dates from above and below this layer (e.g., 54.1 ± 1.6 to
55.8 ± 2.3 ka; Vaquero et al., 2013). Except for samples 7, 8, and 11,
which have relatively large uncertainties (due to larger corrections for
initial 230Th from detritus), the analytical errors are smaller than the
plotted symbols in Fig. 5.
Ages increase with depth, as expected, with the single exception of
sample 4. Dates for coeval sub-samples from level N and core samples
1 and 4 are in close agreement in each case, consistent with closed
U–Th systems. Thus, we do not think the out-of-sequence age of sample
4 is due to failure of the U–Th system in this sample to remain closed.
Instead, we interpret sample 4 as a fallen block of older tufa. Such fallen
segments of the drip curtain are a common occurrence at Abric Romaní
during modern times as the cascading waters produce moss-generated

tufas draping from the top of the overhang. At times, these carbonate
drapes become too heavy and collapse to the ﬂoor of the rock shelter.
It is not surprising that such a block could go unnoticed given the limited exposure provided by the core.
The measured ages of coeval sub-samples of #5 and #12 scatter
somewhat more than expected from analytical errors. Such scatter
could be caused by minor post-crystallization mobility of uranium. We
note that two fractions of #5 (5a and 5b) are in good agreement, suggesting that perhaps only 5c has been perturbed. In the case of #12,
the lowest sample, none of the three fractions are in mutual agreement

and their ages range over about 3%, suggesting the sample has failed to
retain a closed U–Th system or contains variable amounts of secondary
carbonate.
Mean accumulation rates vary considerably over the dated stratigraphic interval. For the uppermost 14 m, (from ~1 m above the excavation ﬂoor to a depth of 13.4 m in the core-hole, deposited from 55 to
73 ka), this rate is 80 cm/ka. For the next ~4.6 m (to 18 m and 102 ka)
the apparent rate is only 17 cm/ka. This is followed by a rate of
130 cm/ka for the bottom-most segment of the core (to 28.5 m and
110 ka). There may be some missing section, or a hiatus, in the segments
between 5 and 6 m, and 13 and 18 m. The ﬁrst hiatus, between ca. 57
and 68 ka, was also suggested by previous dating of samples from the
Romaní well, which penetrates ca. 6.4 m below the current excavation
ﬂoor. In the well, the two lowermost dates indicated an age jump
from 61.0 ± 2.0 to 70.0 ± 2.0 ka over a stratigraphic distance of only
0.6 m (Vaquero et al., 2013). The strata with the highest accumulation
rate observed in the core-hole were deposited from 102 ka to ~110 ka,
coincident with the Last Interglaciation during early MIS 5. The lowest
accumulation rate, from 73 to 102 ka, coincides with the later parts of
MIS 5, including sub-stages 5a, 5b, and 5c. The relatively low accumulation rates during this interval indicate that dry conditions prevailed at
the site making it attractive for occupation, as indicated by the presence
of burned travertine and sand observed in the core.

drill core.

The lithology of the core and our new dates indicate that strata much
like the archeologically-rich strata excavated previously at Abric Romaní
extend a further N30 m below the current excavation level, with varying
accumulation rates, to an age of at least ~110 ka. Burned travertine and
sand observed in the core at depths of ~13 to 18 m below current excavation levels are dated to ages of ~73 to 102 ka, indicating that human presence at the site likely extends N 40 ka beyond that known from presently
excavated levels. Although Paleolithic archeological assemblages with
dates approaching 100 ka were formerly considered uncommon in Iberia,
there is now growing geochronologic evidence suggesting that humans
occupied Mediterranean Spain during the Last Interglacial. For example,

several sites in northeast Iberia contain archeological layers that can be
attributed to MIS 5, e.g., Pedra Dreta and Can Garriga (Giralt et al.,
1995), Arbreda (Soler and Maroto, 1987), Estret de Tragó (Martínez
Moreno et al., 2004) and Rinoceront Cave (Daura et al., 2005).
Our new dating shows that human habitation at Abric Romaní likely
extends over ~ 60 ka and that future excavation at the site will help
assess the presence and character of human occupation of the Iberian
Peninsula during MIS 5. The new dates provide a geochronological
framework for planning future excavations and show that Abric Romaní
will remain an archeological site with unusually reliable and precise age
control for many years to come.
