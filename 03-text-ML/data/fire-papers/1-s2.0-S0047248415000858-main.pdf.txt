When and how humans began to control ﬁre has been a central debate in Paleolithic archaeology for
decades. Fire plays an important role in technology, social organization, subsistence, and manipulation of
the environment and is widely seen as a necessary adaptation for the colonization of northern latitudes.
Many researchers view purported hearths, burnt wooden implements, and heated ﬂints from
€ ningen as providing the best evidence for the control of ﬁre in the Lower Paleolithic of Northern
Scho
Europe. Here we present results of a multianalytical study of the purported hearths along with a critical
€ ningen. We conclude that
examination of other possible evidence of human use or control of ﬁre at Scho
the analyzed features and artifacts present no convincing evidence for human use or control of ﬁre. Our
study also shows that a multianalytical, micro-contextual approach is the best methodology for evaluating claims of early evidence of human-controlled ﬁre. We advise caution with macroscopic, qualitative
identiﬁcation of combustion features, burnt ﬂint, and burnt wood without the application of such
techniques as micromorphology, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, organic petrology,
luminescence, and analysis of mineral magnetic parameters. The lack of evidence for the human control
€ningen raises the possibility that ﬁre control was not a necessary adaptation for the human
of ﬁre at Scho

1. Introduction
The origins of the use and control of ﬁre is one of the central and
most debated topics in Paleolithic archaeology and human evolution (e.g., Goudsblom, 1986; James et al., 1989; de Lumley, 2006;
Gowlett, 2006; Wrangham, 2009; Alperson-Aﬁl and Goren-Inbar,
2010; Roebroeks and Villa, 2011a; Sandgathe et al., 2011a; Gowlett and Wrangham, 2013). Fire use and control would have provided several crucial advantages to early humans: it can serve as a

light and heating source (Oakley, 1955; Bellomo, 1994; Gilligan,
2010), as a hunting aid (Goudsblom, 1986; Mallol et al., 2007),
can be used for cleaning occupation surfaces (Goldberg et al., 2009;
Wadley et al., 2011), as protection from predators (Goudsblom,
1986; Brain, 1991), as a means to improve tool technology
(Ahlers, 1983; Mallol et al., 2007; Brown et al., 2009), and as a way
to increase food range, its nutritional value, and preservation (Stahl
et al., 1984; Bellomo, 1994; Wrangham et al., 1999; Wrangham and
Conklin-Brittain, 2003; Mallol et al., 2007; Wrangham, 2009; for an
overview, see Clark and Harris, 1985). Because of these advantages,
archaeologists assign ﬁre use and control an important role in
human evolution. Brain (1991) suggests that ﬁre use and control
could have increased early humans' competitiveness (Brain, 1991),

182

and Gowlett (2006) and Wrangham (2009) amongst others
(Rolland, 2004; Pruetz and LaDuke, 2010) suggest that ﬁre use and
control impacted the evolution of biological traits, including brain
size and cognition.
Furthermore, several researchers see the use and control of ﬁre
as a precondition for the ﬁrst settlement of northern latitudes
(Oakley, 1955; Brace et al., 1987; Straus, 1989; Weiner et al., 1998;
Wrangham et al., 1999; Klein, 2002; Rolland, 2004; Gowlett,
€ ningen are referenced
2006; Preece et al., 2006). The sites at Scho
as among the earliest such examples (Mania, 1995; Thieme, 1997,
2005, 2007a, b, c, d; Klein, 2002, 2009; Goren-Inbar et al., 2004;
Alperson-Aﬁl and Goren-Inbar, 2006; Gowlett, 2006; Preece et al.,
2006; Berna and Goldberg, 2008; Wrangham, 2009; Daniau et al.,
2010; Roebroeks and Villa, 2011a; Gowlett and Wrangham, 2013;
Shahack-Gross et al., 2014). Northern latitudes present several
challenges to their occupants, having shorter duration of daylight in
winter, severely cold winters, a variety of large predators, and a
scarcity of edible plants during winter, consequently demanding a
stronger reliance on animal resources. According to Gilligan (2010),
these challenges can be answered through seasonal migration,
physical adaptation, or technological improvement in the form of
new hunting weaponry, clothing, use of shelters, and use of ﬁre.
Most evidence for early use of ﬁre relies on macroscopic, qualitative identiﬁcation of residues and objects that appear to have
been affected by ﬁre, often described as a change in color (e.g.,
Purdy and Brooks, 1971; Purdy, 1971, 1975; Shipman et al., 1984).
However, macroscopic observations of burning are often
misleading and need to be conﬁrmed by speciﬁc analyses, such as
micromorphology, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
organic petrology, analysis of mineral magnetic parameters, and
thermoluminescence measurements (e.g., James et al., 1989; Stiner
et al., 1995; Shahack-Gross et al., 1997; Richter, 1998; Goldberg
et al., 2001; Ligouis, 2006; Hanson and Cain, 2007; Roebroeks and
Villa, 2011a). In short, human control of ﬁre is best investigated by
employing a micro-contextual approach (e.g., Karkanas et al.,
2007).
Several researchers cite hearths, burnt wood, and ﬂint from
different localities and ﬁnd horizons as providing evidence for
€ ningen (e.g., Klein, 2002;
human use and control of ﬁre at Scho
Alperson-Aﬁl and Goren-Inbar, 2006; Berna and Goldberg, 2008;
Wrangham, 2009; Weiner, 2010; Roebroeks and Villa, 2011a).
However, apart from a preliminary and inconclusive micromorphological investigation of one of the purported hearths (Schiegl
and Thieme, 2007), only macroscopic, qualitative observations of
€ ningen (Thieme,
ﬁre use and control have been reported at Scho
1997, 1999, 2005, 2007b; Schiegl and Thieme, 2007). Here we
present the ﬁrst contextualized, multianalytical study of deposits,
€ ningen and show that
materials, and purported hearths at Scho
claims for human use and control of ﬁre are highly dubious.
1.1. Early evidence for human use of ﬁre
Evidence for ﬁre in the archaeological record can be the result of
either human action or natural ﬁre, and it is commonly difﬁcult to
separate the two. Therefore, the burden of proof rests on the archaeologists to demonstrate that the evidence for ﬁre clearly represents human action, and not a natural process. Identiﬁcation of
human use of ﬁre is further complicated by the possible human
exploitation of natural ﬁre. Archaeologists generally differentiate
three stages of anthropogenic ﬁre: (1) the use, (2) control, and (3)
production of ﬁre (e.g., Frazer, 1930; Pruetz and LaDuke, 2010;
Sandgathe et al., 2011a). Roebroeks and Villa (2011a) and
Sandgathe et al. (2011a, b) further differentiate between observations of sporadic ﬁre usedincluding the use and controlled use of
ﬁre from natural, more unreliable sourcesdand habitual ﬁre use,

which infers the production of ﬁre, in the archaeological record (see
also Shahack-Gross et al., 2014). In many cases, the stages of ﬁre use
can be differentiated from each other and from natural ﬁre by a
contextual analysis (e.g., Bellomo, 1994; Weiner et al., 1998;
Goldberg et al., 2001; Gowlett et al., 2005; Karkanas et al., 2007;
Roebroeks and Villa, 2011a; Berna et al., 2012; Shahack-Gross
et al., 2014).
1.1.1. Natural ﬁre The earliest evidence for naturally occurring ﬁre
are fragments of charcoal found reported in rocks dating to the
Devonian (Scott, 2000). Fires can be caused by lightning strikes
(which are the source for the majority of natural ﬁres), volcanic
activity, sparks from rock falls, spontaneous combustion, and
meteorite impacts (Batchelder, 1967; Tutin et al., 1996; Jones and
Lim, 2000; Scott, 2000). Tree-crown ﬁres, volcanic eruptions, and
lightning strikes can produce temperatures over 700 C, and tree
stumps, burning humus, or peat ﬁres can burn over elongated
periods (Davis, 1959; Stach et al., 1975; Isaac, 1982; James et al.,
1989; Scott, 1989, 2000; Pyne et al., 1996; DeBano et al., 1998;
Buenger, 2003; Christian et al., 2003; Fessler, 2006). Lightning
strikes and burning tree stumps can produce local heatalterations of sediments that mimic anthropogenic combustion
features (see also Isaac, 1982; Clark and Harris, 1985; Isaac and
Harris, 1997; Scott, 2000).
Evidence that archaeologists assume to be indicative of
anthropogenic ﬁredsuch as burnt bone or heated ﬂint or sedimentdcan also be produced naturally. For example, Hendey
(1976) reported Miocene burnt bone from the fossil bone bed of
Langebaanweg, whereas Avery et al. (2004) mention burnt tortoise
bones caused by bush ﬁres in South Africa and Bordes (1957) reported Miocene burnt ﬂint from Thenay, France. Clark et al. (1984)
and Clark and Harris (1985) reported Pliocene burnt sediment at
Middle Awash, Ethiopia.
1.1.2. Human use of ﬁre Human use or opportunistic use (Clark
and Harris, 1985) of ﬁre includes both conceptualization of ﬁre
and its collection from natural sources (Pruetz and LaDuke, 2010).
Fire use does not represent a unique human behavior, since
chimpanzees have been observed to show predictive behavior
towards ﬁre, and other species are known to exploit wild ﬁres for
warmth and food (Goudsblom, 1986; Wrangham, 2009; Pruetz
and LaDuke, 2010). Human knowledge of ﬁre is difﬁcult to
identify in the archaeological record, and most hypotheses
regarding early humaneﬁre interaction are based on inferences
or indirect data (e.g., Berna et al., 2012; Gowlett and Wrangham,
2013). Some of the earliest evidence for knowledge of ﬁre comes
from the ca. 1.0 Ma site of Wonderwerk in South Africa. Here,
Berna et al. (2012) described ash remains and burnt bone, as
identiﬁed by micromorphological and FTIR analysis, inside the
cave, arguing that one would not expect natural ﬁre in this
setting. Gowlett and Wrangham (2013), using observations of
changes in human morphology, argue that humans used ﬁre as
early as 1.5 Ma, despite the lack of direct archaeological evidence.
1.1.3. Human control of ﬁre Control of ﬁre or predetermined use
(Clark and Harris, 1985) means the maintenance of a ﬁre via fuel
provisioning and restraint. The control of ﬁre includes
preservation and transport of ﬁre from natural sources of ignition
and represents a much more complex and unique human
behavior, excluding some rehabilitated chimpanzees who are
capable of managing campﬁres (Brewer, 1978). Researchers have
argued for indirect evidence for the control of ﬁre, such as
selective burning of materials (Gowlett and Wrangham, 2013)
and materials heated to high temperatures at archaeological sites
(e.g., Brain and Sillen, 1988; Bellomo, 1993, 1994; Preece et al.,
2006; Backhouse and Johnson, 2007). The latter arguments
assume that high temperatures are only reached within campﬁres
and are not reached by natural ﬁres, which exhibit a shorter

M.C. Stahlschmidt et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 89 (2015) 181e201

burning time; however, this assumption is questionable (see above
and Gowlett and Wrangham, 2013).
Combustion features, in the form of structured hearths, provide
the most direct evidence for human control of ﬁre; however, they
can be difﬁcult to identify since they are often ephemeral features
subject to post-depositional alteration. Micromorphological analysis has proven useful in the analysis of archaeological combustion
features (Courty et al., 1989; Goldberg et al., 2001; Karkanas et al.,
2007; Wadley et al., 2011; Mentzer, 2012; Shahack-Gross et al.,
2014). Localized features consisting of heat-altered sediments that
excavators interpreted as the remains of hearths have been reported and subsequently criticized at the Lower Paleolithic sites of
Chesowanja (Gowlett et al., 1981, 1982; Isaac, 1982), Gadeb (Clark
and Kurashina, 1979; Barbetti, 1986), Koobi Fora (Isaac, 1984;
Clark and Harris, 1985; Barbetti, 1986), and Olorgesailie (Isaac,
1977, 1984) in Africa, and Zhoukoudian (Wu, 1985; Binford et al.,
1985; Weiner et al., 1998; Goldberg et al., 2001) in Asia (for a critical overview see James et al., 1989). Alperson-Aﬁl (2008) and
Alperson-Aﬁl and Goren-Inbar (2006), Alperson-Aﬁl et al. (2007)
proposed indirect evidence of hearths at Gesher Benot Ya'aqov,
dated to 800,000 BP. They inferred the former presence of hearths
using spatial analysis of burnt ﬂint, as veriﬁed by thermoluminescence analysis. However, in their discussion of burning by natural
ﬁre they only refute the possibility of an in situ natural ﬁre. Similarly, they do not discuss the possibility that nodules of raw material had been heat altered before human use.
In Europe, burnt sediment at the Lower Paleolithic sites of

€llo
€s (Ve
rtes and Dobosi, 1990), Menez-Dregan (Monnier
Ve
et al., 1994, 2001), and Terra Amata (Villa, 1982, 1983), an accumulation of purported burnt wood at Bilzingsleben (Mania, 1991;
Mania and Mania, 2000; but see Steguweit, 2003), and hearths at
€ ningen (Thieme, 1997, 2005) have been reported as evidence of
Scho
human control of ﬁre. However, the researchers at these sites do
not demonstrate that the purported heat-altered materials are
anthropogenic (see also James et al., 1989; Roebroeks and Villa,
2011a), and the dating of Menez-Dregan is still unclear (Mercier
et al., 2004). Gowlett (2006) and Preece et al. (2007) reported on
scatters of burnt ﬂint and bone next to possible hearths at Beeches
Pit, UK. To date, no data have been published to demonstrate that
the supposed hearths were formed through heating, and it is not
clear if the heated bones and lithic artifacts were produced by
human activities or natural ﬁres (see also Preece et al., 2007).
The most direct and unambiguous evidence for the control of
ﬁre and of habitual ﬁre use in the form of hearths and reused
hearths comes from Qesem Cave in Israel, dated to 400,000 and
300,000 BP, respectively (Karkanas et al., 2007; Shahack-Gross
et al., 2014). In the Middle Paleolithic and Middle Stone Age, evidence for control of ﬁre with discrete hearths is known in Africa
from Sibudu (Wadley et al., 2011), in Asia from sites such as Tabun,
Kebara, and Hayonim (Goldberg, 2003), and in Europe from sites
, Roc de Marsal (Goldberg, 2004; Aldeias et al.,
such as Pech-de-l'Aze
2012; Goldberg et al., 2012), and Abric Romani (Vallverdú et al.,
2010).
1.1.4. Human production of ﬁre Fire can be artiﬁcially produced by
wood-on-wood friction or stone-on-stone percussion in addition to
a tinder source (Hough, 1926; Weiner, 2003). Direct evidence for
this behavior is rare and so far has only been reported from the
Upper Paleolithic (e.g., Weiner and Floss, 2005; Sorensen et al.,
2014), with one possible exception from the Middle Paleolithic
site of Bettencourt, France (Rots, 2011, 2015). Habitual ﬁre use,
manifested in the archaeological record as a repetitive pattern of
ﬁre control, is often seen as a prelude to the production of ﬁre
(Frazer, 1930; Goudsblom, 1986; Gowlett, 2006; Pruetz and
LaDuke, 2010). Sandgathe et al. (2011a, b) maintain that habitual
ﬁre use presents indirect evidence for ﬁre production. They

183

further argue, based on a lack of evidence for habitual ﬁre use at
, that Middle
the sites of Roc de Marsal and Pech-de-l'Aze
Paleolithic humans in Europe still relied on scarce, natural
sources of ignition and that Neanderthals lacked the ability to
make ﬁre (Sandgathe et al., 2011a; but see Roebroeks and Villa,
2011b).

1.2. Scho
€ningen lies between the North
1.2.1. Setting and geology Scho
German Plain to the north and the Harz Mountains to the southeast
(Fig. 1) and is situated at the southeastern foot of the Elm, a
limestone ridge 25 km long and up to 8 km wide (Elsner, 2003)
at an altitude of 114 m above mean sea level.
€ningen is located on the southwestern syncline of the OffScho
leben salt wall and in the Helmstedt Staßfurt salt structure (Mania,
€ ningen is
1995; Brandes et al., 2012). Today the site complex of Scho
located in an open-cast lignite mine, which exposes Middle Pleistocene sites sandwiched between glaciogenic deposits of the
Elsterian and Saalian glaciations (Urban et al., 1991a; Mania, 1995;
Elsner, 2003; Ehlers et al., 2004). The Paleolithic site complex of
€ningen is preserved in an elongated trough, which dissects the
Scho
underlying Paleogene marine bedrock. Lang et al. (2012, 2015)
recently interpreted the trough as a tunnel valley that formed underneath the Elsterian ice shield. Mania (1995, 2007) interpreted
the formation of the trough as a result of salt dome solution, which
resulted in lowering of the basin. He suggested that recurring ﬂuvial
activity at the onset of a warm period would have eroded and
inﬁlled the trough during the interglacial following the Elsterian.
1.2.2. Stratigraphy The trough is ﬁlled with Elsterian glaciogenic
deposits that are unconformably overlain by a sequence of interglacial deltaic and lacustrine deposits. These deposits are in turn
capped by Saalian glaciogenic deposits and Weichselian loess

(Fig. 2). The interglacial Middle Pleistocene sedimentary sequence,
which contains the numerous Paleolithic layers, consists of three
major superimposed deltaic systems (Urban, 1995, 2007; Lang
et al., 2012; Figs. 2 and 3). Urban (2007) and Van Kolfschoten
(2014) assign the ﬁrst deltaic systems to the Holsteinian
interglacial and MIS 11. However, the correlation of the
Holsteinian interglacial with MIS 9 or 11 is still under debate
(Geyh and Müller, 2005; Ashton et al., 2008; Geyh and Krbetschek,
2012).
The second major deltaic system consists of a series of lacustrine
deposits (Figs. 2 and 3; Lang et al., 2012) and contains the materials
€ningen 12 B and Scho
€ningen 13 II analyzed in this
from sites Scho
€ ningen 13 II and 12 B in
study. Biostratigraphic evidence places Scho
the Reinsdorf Interglacial, which was most recently dated to MIS 9
(Urban, 2007; Urban and Sierralta, 2012; but see Urban et al., 2015).
Some researchers (Litt et al., 2007; Bittmann, 2012; Lang et al.,
2012) argue that the Reinsdorf Interglacial is a possible equivalent subset of the Holsteinian Interglacial. The sedimentary
€ningen 13 II consists of ﬁve lacustrine cycles of
sequence at Scho
gray calcareous mud that grade upward into dark brown organic
muds (Thieme, 2007c; Urban, 2007; Stahlschmidt et al., 2015).
Geological studies (Mania, 2007; Urban, 2007; Lang et al., 2012)
interpret the alternation between marl and organic mud at
€ ningen 13 II as a result of lake-level ﬂuctuations related to
Scho
variations in climate. Similarly, the sedimentary sequence at
€ ningen 12 B consists of sequences of calcareous muds and
Scho
organic rich deposits interpreted as the result of lake level changes
(Thieme and Maier, 1995).
Urban et al. (1991a) assign the third episode of deltaic inﬁll,
which has only been exposed in the northern mine, to the
€ ningen Interglacial, which they interpret as an equivalent of
Scho
marine isotope stage 7 (MIS 7). The same authors (Urban et al.,
1991a, b) also report travertine and peat in the northern part of
the mine, which they correlate with Eemian MIS 5e and substages
5d and 5c.
1.2.3. Archaeology During the course of mining, which began at
€ ningen in the 1970s, the miners artiﬁcially lowered the
Scho
groundwater table through the construction of several deep wells.
Starting in 1983 state archaeologist H. Thieme monitored operations at the lignite mine and discovered the ﬁrst Paleolithic artifacts
in 1992 (Thieme, 1997). Additional wells were then constructed to
facilitate subsequent archaeological excavation. Twenty-eight
Paleolithic sites and ﬁnd horizons were discovered in association
with the mine (Serangeli et al., 2012; Serangeli and Conard,

€ ningen sites discussed here (after Mania in Thieme, 1999:457
Figure 3. Map of Scho
€ningen sites are located in an open-cast mine
and Serangeli et al., 2012:14). The Scho
€ ningen 13 II and 12 B are associated with sediments from the second
and the sites Scho
major cycle of lacustrine deposition. The approximate 13 II proﬁle position refers to
Figure 2.

2015), most of which were excavated as salvage operations. The
sites contain lithic material, bone remains, and wooden artifacts,
the last being excellently preserved due to the waterlogged state
of the deposits. The materials discussed in this study come from
€ ningen 12 B and 13 II.
Scho
€ ningen 13 II Excavations at Scho
€ningen 13 II began in
1.2.4. Scho
€ningen 13 II-4
1994 and are ongoing. Archaeological artifacts at Scho
are mostly found at the contact of layer 4b/c, a calcareous marl,
with layer 4b, an organic mud (e.g., Stahlschmidt et al., 2015),
and consist of butchered horse remains, wooden spears, and
numerous ﬂint artifacts in addition to purported evidence for
anthropogenic ﬁre (Thieme, 1997, 2005, 2007b; Voormolen, 2008;
€ hner, 2012; Van Kolfschoten, 2014; Schoch et al.,
Serangeli and Bo
2015; Fig. 4).
€ningen 13 II-3 and 13 II-2 bone remains, lithic artifacts,
At Scho
and one wooden artifact were discovered (Thieme, 2002, 2007d;
€ hner, 2012). Here, the recent excavation team
Serangeli and Bo
observed an additional case of possible heat-altered sediment. They
noted a vertical crack several meters long through the calcareous
marl of 13 II-3 and across layers 13 II-2 that was ﬁlled with black
sediment (Fig. 5; see below).
€ ningen 12 B Scho
€ ningen 12 B was a rescue excavation,
1.2.5. Scho
and the locality contains two ﬁnd horizons. Find horizon 1 consists
of a sandy mud and ﬁnd horizon 2 of coarse detrital mud, both
containing bone remains and lithic material (Thieme and Maier,
1995). Mania (1995) and Thieme (2007c) reported an
accumulation of burnt wood in ﬁnd horizon 2 and interpreted
this accumulation of burnt wood as a possible hearth. The ﬁnd

185

Thieme (2007) conducted an inconclusive micromorphological

€ningen are based on
for the anthropogenic origin of ﬁre at Scho
the association of supposedly burnt materials with archaeological
remains (e.g., Thieme, 2005).
1.2.7. Evidence for ﬁre e hearths Thieme (1997, 1999, 2005,
€ ningen as hearths (see
2007b) interpreted four features at Scho
Fig. 4). His interpretation was based on macroscopic observations
of localized reddening of the calcareous marl, layer 4b/c, at the
contact with the organic mud, layer 4b, and on cracks in the
sediment at this contact (Thieme, 1997, 1999, 2005; Schiegl and
Thieme, 2007; Fig. 6). Thieme excavated the features only
partially and preserved the remaining sediment columns in
wooden cases for future analysis. The recent excavation team
reopened and excavated the hearth features between 2010 and
2012, noting that they had been affected by bioturbation and
drying (Fig. 6). No charcoal, burnt bone, or ash was recovered
from the features. Thieme reported that the hearths had a
dimension of 1 m2, whereas upon reopening the wooden cases,
the reddened area was up to 3 m2, thus presenting what would

(Richter and Krbetscheck, 2015). None of these pieces show clear
characteristics of having been worked or modiﬁed by humans
(Richter, 1998, 2007; Richter and Thieme, 2012; Richter and
Krbetscheck, 2015).
Since its discovery and the reporting of evidence for ﬁre,
€ningen has been cited in almost all of the major reviews of
Scho
early evidence for ﬁre (Gowlett, 2006; Klein, 2009; Wrangham,
2009; Alperson-Aﬁl and Goren-Inbar, 2010; Daniau et al., 2010;
Roebroeks and Villa, 2011a; Gowlett and Wrangham, 2013). Several
studies mention ﬁre-hardening of the wooden spears from
€ningen as evidence for human use of ﬁre (Rice, 2007; Berna
Scho
and Goldberg, 2008; Coolidge and Wynn, 2009; Alperson-Aﬁl and
Goren-Inbar, 2010; Weiner, 2010). Neither Thieme (1997, 2005) nor
any subsequent studies (Schoch et al., 2015) described the spears as
exhibiting evidence for heating.

be unusually large hearths (but see Shahack-Gross et al. [2014] for
similarly large hearths). Preliminary micromorphological analysis
by S. Schiegl on thin sections from hearth 1 detected the
presence of quartz grains with surface cracks, which she
suggested could have been caused by heating. However, Schiegl
and Thieme (2007) also pointed out that the mollusk shells
within the sediment from hearth 1 did not appear altered by
heat. The authors reported these results as inconclusive (Schiegl
and Thieme, 2007).

fragments of burnt wood from Scho

1995; Thieme, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2007a, b, c, d; W. Schoch,
pers. comm.; Table 1). Two accumulations of burnt wood in
€ ningen 13 II-2 Berm and 12 A ﬁnd horizon 2 were reported
Scho
as hearths, but no details were provided. Thieme (2005) also
reported a piece of wood that appeared to be worked by humans
and also possibly burnt. He interpreted this as a roasting stick, or
Bratspieß.

2.1.1. Hearths All four purported hearths from Scho
were sampled in blocks from various locations that encompass
the sediments of layer 4b/c, layer 4b, and their contact, where the
purported hearths are located (Fig. 6). Hearth 1 was analyzed by
all methods, whereas the remaining hearths were investigated
only with micromorphology. One bulk sample from layer 4b, two
block samples and one bulk sample from layer 4b/c, and one
block sample encompassing the contact of layer 4b/c with the
overlying sediments, layer 4b, with no reddening in between,
were additionally taken outside the hearths to serve as control
samples (Table 2). The control bulk samples were used for a
heating experiment, studied by micromorphology, FTIR, mineral
magnetic parameters, and thermoluminescence, and the control
block samples were studied by micromorphology and
thermoluminescence.
2.1.2. Burnt sediment Two bulk samples from the black, purport€ningen 13
edly burnt sediment from the crack running through Scho
II-3 and 13 II-2 were taken at the contact of an organic mud from 13
II-2 and studied by organic petrology.
2.1.3. Burnt wood A piece (2 mm3) of purported carbonized wood
€ningen 12 B and the
from a supposed wooden artifact from Scho
attached sediment were studied by organic petrology. Sampling
here was conducted by the Department of State Heritage Lower
Saxony.
2.2. Methods
Both micromorphological and organic petrology analyses were
employed to describe microscopic organic constituents. For clarity
and consistency between the two methods we employ the term
“plant tissue” for organic constituents originating from plants. This
term is similar to soil micromorphology terms such as “plant residue” (Stoops, 2003) and organic petrology terms such as “macerals” (Taylor et al., 1998).
2.2.1. Micromorphology Micromorphology is the study of intact
blocks of sediment and soils in thin section using a petrographic
microscope. It permits identiﬁcation of the composition, texture,
structure, and fabric of the deposits, as well as the observation of
pedogenic and anthropogenic features. Since the original integrity
of the sediment is conserved it is possible to determine the relative
spatial and temporal relationships among materials and voids in
the sample (e.g., Courty et al., 1989). The technique of

Note that only in one instance (burnt lithics 13 I) were analyses able to conﬁrm the burnt state of the material, while at the same time an anthropogenic involvement is doubtful.

micromorphology has proven to be a powerful tool for detecting
early ﬁre by revealing the presence of ash and the in situ
character of hearth-related features (e.g., at Sibudu [Goldberg
et al., 2009], Qesem Cave [Karkanas et al., 2007; Shahack-Gross
et al., 2014], Wonderwerk Cave [Berna et al., 2012], Kebara, and
Hayonim Cave [Goldberg and Bar-Yosef, 1998]); it was also
successfully applied to the correction of claims of ﬁre at
Zhoukoudian (Goldberg et al., 2001).
For the micromorphological study, oriented blocks of sediment
were collected in the ﬁeld and stabilized by plaster of Paris or
wooden containers. Sample preparation was conducted at the
Geoarchaeology Laboratory, University of Tübingen. Samples were
oven dried at 40 C for 1 day and then impregnated under a vacuum
with a 7:3 part mixture of unpromoted polyester resin and styrene,
catalyzed with methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP). After 5e10
days the samples were again heated at 50 C until they had hardened completely. The hardened blocks were then sliced into tiles of
50  75  10 mm. Thin sections were produced by Spectrum Petrographics, Inc. in Vancouver, Washington, U.S.A., and Th. Beckmann, Braunschweig, Germany. Analysis of the resulting thin
sections was conducted with a Zeiss Axio Imager petrographic
microscope under plane-polarized (PPL), cross-polarized (XPL), and
blue light ﬂuorescence, at magniﬁcations of 20 to 500.
Description and analysis follows Courty et al. (1989), Stoops (2003),
and Stoops et al. (2010).
2.2.2. Organic petrology Organic petrology is a branch of earth
sciences that is widely used in the study of peat, brown coal, and
hard coal properties with reﬂected light microscopy (Taylor et al.,
1998). The study of the reﬂectance and ﬂuorescence of organic
constituents can be informative about the presence of charred
plant material (wood, seeds, tissues etc.), which constitutes
important evidence for fuel use and combustion conditions (e.g.,
Schiegl et al., 2004; Ligouis, 2006; Goldberg et al., 2009; Clark
and Ligouis, 2010).
Organic petrological investigations are carried out on wellpolished surfaces of particulate- or block-samples in reﬂected
white light and in ﬂuorescence mode on organic particles known as
“macerals” (see Stahlschmidt et al., 2015:Table 3 for organic
petrology terms). Sample preparation for organic petrology was
conducted at the Laboratory for Applied Organic Petrology (LAOP)
at the University of Tübingen. Polarized light is used to assess the
properties (anisotropy, mosaic structure) of the carbon forms,
especially if they result from coal carbonization (coke) and from
incomplete combustion of fossil fuels (nonburnt carbon in the form
of char; Taylor et al., 1998). Analysis was conducted with a Leitz
DMRX-MPVSP microscope photometer equipped for reﬂected
white-light and blue-light illumination, and is set up with oil immersion objectives (20 to 50).
2.2.3. FTIR Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometric analysis was
performed on thin sections and loose samples. Fourier-Transform
Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is used in order to determine the
characteristic molecular absorptions of infrared radiation by
organic and inorganic material. The resulting infrared absorbance
spectra are used to understand the composition of archaeological
sediments and materials. Furthermore, FTIR spectroscopy is very
sensitive to variations in composition (substitutions) and
crystallography (atomic order) that result from diagenetic
processes such as heat alteration (e.g., Weiner, 2010).
Sample preparation was performed at the MicroStratigraphy
Laboratory at Boston University. Powdered aliquots of experimental
and archaeological samples were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy
using a Thermo-Nicolet Nexus 470 IR spectrometer. Representative
FTIR spectra were obtained by grinding a few tens of micrograms of
sample with an agate mortar and pestle. About 0.1 mg or less of the
sample was mixed with about 80 mg of KBr (IR-grade). A 7 mm

between layer 4b/c and layer 4b is overprinted by an indurated, reddened crust, which was interpreted as the result of heat alteration (Thieme, 1997, 2005). The squares show the
approximate locations of samples for micromorphology, FTIR, and organic petrology (all “M”), for study of mineral magnetic parameters (“P”), and for thermoluminescence analysis

collected between 4000 and 400 cm1 at 4 cm1 resolution. The
presence of FTIR absorption of organic and inorganic phases was

identiﬁed by using in-house or ad hoc spectral libraries (i.e.,
Weiner, 2010).

hard rocks that result from diagenetic redox-processes,
pedogenesis, and also thermal alteration. Thermal alteration leads
to an enhancement of mineral magnetic parameters caused ﬁrstly
by the thermal degradation of plant material and secondly by the
transformation of para- and/or antiferromagnetic iron minerals to
ferrimagnetics. This enhancement of mineral magnetic
parameters can be identiﬁed by low ﬁeld susceptibility and
concentration of independent interparametric ratios derived from
laboratory induced remanences (Dalan and Banerjee, 1998; Evans
and Heller, 2003).
Sample preparation was conducted at the Laboratory for Palaeoand Environmental Magnetism, Bayreuth University, Germany. The
low ﬁeld magnetic susceptibility was determined with a MAGNON
Susceptibility Bridge (MAGNON, Dassel, Germany) at AC-ﬁelds of
300 A/m at 0.3 and 3 kHz, respectively, and is given as mass speciﬁc
susceptibility (c). The frequency dependence of susceptibility (cfd)
(cfd% ¼ [c(0.3 kHz)  c(3 kHz)]/c(0.3 kHz)  100 in %) is a measure
of the relative contribution of SP-ferrimagnetica close to the SP-SD
threshold. c reﬂects concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals and
also grain size distribution. Fine-grained superparamagnetic (SP)
ferrimagnetica (<0.03 mm) have a 2e3 times higher c than stable
single-domain, pseudosingle-domain (SSD, PSD; ~0.03e10 mm),
and multidomain ferrimagnetica (MD, >~10 mm; Evans and Heller,
2003). Induced isothermal remanent magnetizations (IRMs) were
determined after exposing the samples to a pulsed ﬁeld of 2000
and 200 mT (back ﬁeld), respectively, along one spatial axis.
Magnetization was produced using a MAGNON PM II pulse
magnetizer and measured via an AGICO JR6-spinner magnetometer
(AGICO, Brno, Czech Republic). The IRM acquired in the 2 T ﬁeld is
regarded as saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM).
As the SP-size fraction is deﬁned by the absence of magnetic
remanence under room temperature, IRMs are essentially
controlled by the concentration of SSD to MD-ferrimagnetica.
Furthermore, IRMs depend on the mineralogical composition
with ferrimagnetica (magnetite, maghemite) being more easily
magnetized than antiferromagnetica (goethite, hematite; Maher,
1986). Therefore, the modiﬁed S-ratio (¼ ((IRM200mT/
IRM2000mT) þ 1)/2) is indicative of the relative abundance of
ferrimagnetica to antiferromagnetica and a concentrationindependent proxy (Walden et al., 1999; van Velzen and Deckers,
1999).
Anhysteretic remanent magnetizations (ARMs) were induced
with a 50 mT static ﬁeld and 100 mT alternating ﬁeld (AF) amplitude
using a Magnon AFD 300 demagnetizer. The ARM was produced
along one spatial axis, and remanent magnetization was measured
via the AGICO JR6-spinner magnetometer. Similar to the IRM, the
ARM reﬂects the concentration of remanence carrying magnetic
phases. However, the ARM decreases more strongly from the SSD to
the MD-fraction than does the SIRM. Therefore, the IRM/ARM ratio
is a useful concentration-independent proxy for detecting changes
in the ratio of SSD-MD fraction versus SSD fraction (Maher, 1986;
Evans and Heller, 2003).
2.2.5. Thermoluminescence Thermoluminescence (TL) analysis
can determine if sediment has been exposed to heating in the past
by analyzing the TL glow curve shapes and TL sensitivities. Luminescence has been frequently used to examine the presence of
temperature-induced changes in sediment and subsequently to
determine the age of heated sediment from archaeological
contexts (Aitken, 1985; Alperson-Aﬁl et al., 2007). Veriﬁcation of
prehistoric heating is usually done by the heating plateau test
(Aitken, 1985), where a ﬂat ratio of TL induced by artiﬁcial
irradiation versus the natural TL signal provides evidence of the
heating in the past. However, the material under study here is
sediment, and bleaching of the signal during deposition or
sampling could induce results comparable to heating. Therefore

the heating plateau test alone is not proof of a prehistoric ﬁring
event. However, heating of minerals changes the sensitivity of the
TL-signal and results in different shapes of the TL-glow curves,
which can indicate prehistoric heating.
Sample preparation was conducted at the Max Planck Institute
for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. TL measurements were performed on a Risø Da-15 luminescence reader at
5 K s1 to 450 C with immediate background subtraction. Luminescence detection with an EMI 9236QA photomultiplier was
restricted to the UV-blue wavelength range by Corning 5-58 and
KG-5 glass ﬁlters. Irradiations were performed with a calibrated
external 90Sr/90Y-source, and samples were stored at 50 C for one
week before measurement. Prior to the luminescence study, the
organic and carbonate content of this ﬁne grained sediment was
removed and the ﬁne grain fraction (4e11 mm) was extracted according to Stokes law.
2.2.6. Heating experiment Sample preparation and the heating
experiment itself were performed at the Geoarchaeology Laboratory, University of Tübingen. Sediment samples from layer 4b/c and
€ningen 13 II-4 were subjected to a stepwise
layer 4b from Scho
heating experiment. The samples were heated for 4 h in a mufﬂe
furnace to temperatures of 100 C, 200 C, 300 C, 400 C, 500 C,
700 C, 800 C, 900 C, 1000 C, and 1100 C, and subsequently
cooled down for at least 24 h in a desiccator. In a second run, no
desiccator was employed to account for possible variance, but
none was observed and only some test analyses of the mineral
magnetic parameters were carried out on these. Color change and
weight loss were recorded and further analyses were chosen
based on these observations. The samples of layer 4b were only
studied macroscopically. For the samples of layer 4b/c, study of the
mineral magnetic parameters was conducted on the whole
temperature range. Micromorphological analyses and FTIR
spectroscopy were also performed on the samples from layer 4b/c
between temperatures of 400 Ce1100 C. Thermoluminescence
analyses were conducted on samples from layer 4b/c heated to
400 C, 700 C, and 900 C. A non-heated sample from layer 4b/c

was analyzed with micromorphology, FTIR, by study of the
mineral magnetic parameters, and by thermoluminescence
analyses.

3.1. Hearths at Scho
Stahlschmidt et al. (2015) present a detailed analysis of the
geological context of the purported hearth features and the
following includes a short review of the geological context.
3.1.1. Geological context e layer 4b Layer 4b is composed of dark
brown (Munsell Soil Color Chart 7.5YR 3/2) organic silt, which
locally exhibits laminations. Layer 4b has a variable but maximal
thickness of 35 cm. Under the microscope, layer 4b is composed
mostly of small (<0.3 mm), slightly humiﬁed fragments of plant
tissue, with a minor portion of rounded, sand- to silt-sized grains of
quartz and mica (Tables 3 and 4). Framboidal pyrite, diatoms,
sponge spicules, and secondary nodules of gypsum were
additionally noted in thin section. The microstructure is massive
with some lamina distinguished by increased silt-sand-sized
quartz and clay content. No evidence for heat alteration was
found in this layer (Table 3).
3.1.2. Geological context e layer 4b/c Macroscopically, layer 4b/c
is a calcareous mud with some mollusks that represent the only
macroscopically identiﬁable materials in addition to the archaeological remains. Layer 4b/c exhibits minor soft sediment deformation, and it varies in color from brownish gray to gray (Munsell Soil
Color Chart 2.5YR 6/3, 5/4, 6/1, and 10YR 5/8 to 4/6), which results
from variable content of plant material, pyrite, and iron precipitations (see Stahlschmidt et al., 2015). Microscopically, layer 4b/
c consists of small (<0.3 mm), slightly humiﬁed fragments of plant
tissue, pyrite, silt- to sand-sized quartz grains, diatoms, and shell
fragments in a calcareous matrix (Fig. 7d, e; Table 3).
Below the strongly reddened features interpreted as hearths,
layer 4b/c appears slightly more red than the marls outside the

purported hearth areas (Munsell Soil Color Chart 2.5YR 5/3). Excavators initially thought that this was also a result of heat alteration. However, the micromorphological analyses revealed the
reddish colorations result from localized iron oxidation associated
with microscopic plant tissues and oxidation of the ubiquitous
pyrite (see above). The general reﬂectance value of the plant tissue
from layer 4b/c (0.17%Rr to 0.22%Rr) indicates humiﬁcation and
geliﬁcation, not charring (Fig. 8). Only very few, dispersed fragmented pieces of charred plant tissue were observed (Fig. 9). The
recorded ﬂuorescence color and intensity of the plant tissue are
typical for the peat stage of plant tissue and corroborate the
reﬂectance values. Micromorphological analyses on layer 4b/c from
outside the hearths showed no difference in components or
structures from within the four hearths. Similarly, thermoluminescence analysis showed no difference in the glow curve shape

purported hearths (Scho
The heating plateau test indicates an apparent zeroing of the
sample from hearth 1 (Fig. 10b), but the plateau is even more
pronounced in the sample outside the hearths (Fig. 10d). Furthermore, heating as a single cause is revoked by bleaching experiments that showed the bleachability of the TL signal. Consequently,
the presence of a plateau is not suited here for testing the occurrence of heating. A heating plateau is expected for luminescence
not in saturation, but changes in sensitivities and especially glow
curve shapes have to occur when sediment is heated. The sediment
from layer 4b/c from outside the hearths was experimentally
heated in the laboratory and shows an entirely different sensitivity
and rather different glow curve shapes (Sch 13 II-4 Br Ex 4b/c LS 39
BT-1080; Fig. 10e) compared to the samples obtained from the
€ ningen site (Fig. 10a and c). Taken together, these results
Scho
suggest that the samples from hearth 1 and outside the hearths did
not experience different temperatures.
3.1.3. Results of the heating experiment Table 5 provides an
overview of the results of the heating experiment. The heated
samples from layer 4b/c show a range of reactions starting from
100 to 300 , at which point destruction of ferromagnetic Fesulﬁdes occurs and neo-formation of para- and supermagnetic
phases (SP) takes place (Fig. 11). Stable single domain (SSD)
magnetite/maghemite forms at 400 C (Fig. 11). A macroscopic

color change from greyish brown to pale brown was ﬁrst
observed at 500 C (Fig. 7f). The color change continues to reddish
yellow (Munsell Soil Color 7.5YR 7/4-6/4) from 700 to 800 C and
to light gray (Munsell Soil Color 10YR 7/2) at 900 C. The change
in color noticed in our experiments is likely a result of 1) gray
shell fragments and orange staining by iron oxidation at 500 C,
2) blackened shell fragments and an increase in dark red and
orange staining from 800 C onwards, 3) calcite depletion from
700 to 800 C, and 4) destruction of magnetite/maghemite from
700 to 900 C with hematite formation at 800 C and 900 C
(Figs. 7g and 11). Furthermore, we observed that kaolinite is
absent from samples heated to 400 C, and that portlandite ﬁrst
appears at 700 C (Fig. 12) as a result of CaO re-hydration (Weiner,
2010). Finally, at 1000 C all Fe-bearing phases are transformed to
magnetite/maghemite (Fig. 11). The shape of the TL signal
changes as a result of laboratory heating as observed in the
samples heated to 400 C, 700 C, and 900 C (Fig. 10e).
Additionally, for an identical dose the sensitivity is raised by a

the purported hearths.
3.1.4. The reddening/purported hearth features The reddened
contact between layers 4b/c and 4b occupied horizontal spaces
of 1e3 m3, varying among the four hearths. The reddened
contact consists of a consolidated hard crust with a thickness of
2e3 cm and a brownish yellow to reddish yellow color (Munsell
Soil Color 10YR 6/8- 7.5YR 6/6). Microscopically, the reddening is
composed of amorphous iron that impregnated the groundmass
of layers 4b and 4b/c. This reddening is in fact composed of
several microlayers, which indicates multiple episodes of

formation (Fig. 7aec). Oxygen-rich water in combination with a
redox (reduction/oxidation) boundary at the contact of the two
layers brought about the massive precipitation of iron at the
contact. Other spatially extensive iron oxidation features at
similar sedimentary contacts were observed in the excavation
€ningen 13 II (Fig. 13). Moreover, the observation
area at Scho
by the excavators that the reddened contact has grown
vertically and horizontally over the years supports the
assumption that the reddening represents a recent, on-going
process, likely related to the recent groundwater lowering at
the mine.

Micromorphological analyses did not detect ash remains or
phytoliths associated with the reddening and revealed only a few,
isolated charcoal fragments. Reﬂectance values indicate generally
low humiﬁcation of the plant tissues. Organic petrology analysis
observed very few, small (<0.3 mm) fragmented, charred particles
and showed that the charred plant tissues are herbaceous (Table 4;
Fig. 14). Accordingly, they most likely derive from natural peat ﬁres.
Bone, ostracod, and mollusk shell fragments in thin section show
no evidence for heat alteration (Fig. 7d, e; Table 3). Furthermore,
FTIR analyses demonstrated the presence of kaolinite, which is not
stable above temperatures of 400 C (Fig. 12). None of the experimentally produced heat alterations (charring of plant tissue, color
change of shell fragments, formation of portlandite, hematite,
magnetite, or calcite depletion) were observed on the material
obtained from the purported hearths, and the local red staining
observed in the heating experiment is unlike the reddening at the
purported hearths (see above).

wood piece showed reﬂectance values that indicate combustion
(which would be >0.6%Rr). Brown ﬂuorescence of the cell walls
shows that the wood sample is composed of humic substances in
addition to lignin and cellulose.

Pit, Gowlett et al. (2005) identify hearths based on the presence of
oxidized sediments overlain by dark-colored deposits. They note
the spatial association of these features with clusters of burnt ﬂint
and bone. However, the inferred temperature of 350e800 C for the
bones and lithic material does not exclude natural ﬁres, and no
analysis of the purported hearth sediments has yet been presented.
A detailed micro-contextual analysis of the purported hearths, as
also proposed by Gowlett et al. (2005), would potentially be able to
differentiate between natural and anthropogenic ﬁre.

The lack of evidence for human induced ﬁre at Scho
the questionable evidence at Beeches Pit, leaves archaeologists
with no conclusive evidence for human control of ﬁre in northern
latitudes during the Lower Paleolithic (Roebroeks and Villa, 2011a).
This stands in contrast to the evidence for human occupation as
early as 800,000 years ago above the 50th degree of latitude in
Europe (Parﬁtt et al., 2010). The lack of evidence for human use and
control of ﬁre could be either a result of poor preservation, human
behavior, or both.

4.2.1. Preservation Surovell and Brantingham (2007) argue that
the archaeological record is subject to taphonomic biases, which
cause overrepresentation of younger periods relative to older
periods (but see Surovell et al., 2009). The lack of early evidence
for human use and control of ﬁre in northern latitudes might also
be a result of taphonomic processes erasing the evidence
(Sandgathe et al., 2011b). Hearths and burnt materials can be
subject to destructive processes, such as bioturbation, erosion,
and chemical alterations (e.g., Sergant et al., 2006; Mallol et al.,
2007; Braadbaart et al., 2009; Mentzer, 2012). Combustion
features can also be inﬂuenced by geochemical conditions and
modiﬁcations of the depositional environment (e.g., ShahackGross et al., 2004, 2014). For example, in northern latitudes acidic
soils predominate (e.g., Jones et al., 2010), which negatively
affects ash preservation. However, charcoal shows better
preservation under acidic, rather than alkaline conditions
(Braadbaart et al., 2009). Caves and rockshelters exhibit very good
preservation properties, as shown by the rich record of wellpreserved hearth features in Middle Paleolithic sites in Europe,

the Near East, and Africa (e.g., Goldberg and Bar-Yosef, 1998;
Goldberg et al., 2009; Wadley et al., 2011). However, Lower
Paleolithic sites in caves and rock shelters in Europe have not
been reported to contain any evidence for human use of ﬁre (e.g.,
Atapuerca Gran Dolina and Sima del Elefante, Arago,
Treugol'naya, and Visogliano; Roebroeks and Villa, 2011a).
Most Lower Paleolithic sites in northern latitudes are located in
open-air settings (e.g., Pakeﬁeld, Boxgrove, Happisburgh,
€ ningen, Bilzingsleben), and sites in open-air settings are subScho
ject to more pronounced post-depositional alterations, such as
bioturbation, erosion, and subaerial weathering (Goldberg and
Sherwood, 2006). Sergant et al. (2006), in their investigation of a
lack of Mesolithic hearths in the NW European plain, argue that
unstructured hearths rarely preserve in this type of setting, since
they are erased by bioturbation and erosion. Mallol et al. (2007) in
an ethnographic study on the use of ﬁre by the Hadza observed that
taphonomic processes, such as root invasion and erosion, can erase
hearths in open-air settings, but that microscopic traces are often
preserved depending on sedimentation rate. Supporting those
observations, Friesem et al. (2013) report on a Middle Paleolithic
hearth in an open-air setting, noting that it was likely preserved
because of rapid burial.
4.2.2. Human behavior Gowlett and Wrangham (2013) argue that
a lack of natural ﬁre in northern latitudes presented a limiting
factor for human settlement there. However, whereas most of the
Lower Paleolithic sites in Europe date to interglacials (e.g.,
€ ningen), there are sites
Boxgrove, Bilzingsleben, Pakeﬁeld, Scho
occupied during unfavorable climatic conditions, such as
Happisburgh (Parﬁtt et al., 2010). Sandgathe and colleagues
(2011a, b) claim that Neanderthals did not practice habitual ﬁre
use and that they depended on natural sources of ﬁre. However,
contradicting Sandgathe et al.'s claim, Rots (2011, 2015) presents
evidence for ignition activities on a Levallois point at the site of
Bettencourt, France. The current state of evidence strongly
suggests that the ﬁrst inhabitants of northern Europe did not
habitually use and control ﬁre (Roebroeks and Villa, 2011a).
An independence from ﬁre seems odd in the face of data indicating that modern humans cannot survive, even if fully acclimatized, to temperatures below 5 C without some kind of protection
against the cold in the form of clothing, ﬁre, or shelter (Hardy et al.,
1971; Gilligan, 2010). However, it is possible that archaic humans

might have had a different temperature tolerance. In this context,
providing warmth seems the most important application of ﬁre
next to providing nutritional improvement and light. Use of shelters, seasonal migration, a stronger reliance on animal food
resource, clothing, and physical and nutritional adaptation present
further strategies to cope with a colder environment (Gilligan,
2010).
Some Lower Paleolithic sites in Europe are situated in rock
shelters and caves that could have provided protection. However,
most of the known Lower Paleolithic record consists of open-air
sites. The analysis of sites in open-air settings have not yet yielded reliable evidence for the construction of shelters in the Lower
and Middle Paleolithic (cf. the controversial cases of Terra Amata
[de Lumley, 1969], Chichibu [Hadﬁeld, 2000], and Bilzingsleben
[Mania and Mania, 2000]). Constructed shelters become a common
feature of archaeological sites only in the Upper Paleolithic
(Iakovleva and Djindjian, 2005; Svoboda et al., 2005).
Seasonal migration in winter to areas with less harsh climate or
only ephemeral occupation have been suggested for Early Pleistocene occupation in northern latitudes (e.g., Roebroeks, 2001;
Dennell, 2003, 2013), but high resolution data on seasonal signals
and cold or warm phase occupation is often lacking. So far this
option has been explored in detail only from the later Middle
blot-Augustins, 1993). Similarly, the
Paleolithic onward (e.g., Fe
fossil record of the Middle Pleistocene in northern latitudes is too
sparse to ascertain a physical adaptation to colder climates,
whereas with the Middle Paleolithic a cold-adapted speciesdthe
Neanderthalsdappears in Europe (Sergi, 1944; Churchill, 1998;
Steegmann et al., 2002; Snodgrass and Leonard, 2009; but see
Rae et al., 2011).
Some researchers suggest that an increase in the consumption
of animal resources is a necessary adaptation in order to maintain a
high metabolic rate when confronted with the rarity of plant food
in northern latitudes (Snodgrass and Leonard, 2009; but see Speth,
2010). However, more detailed studies of edible plants in northern
latitudes are still in progress (Bigga et al., 2015). The lack of vitamin
C caused by the scarcity of plant food could have been answered
with an increase of rawdnot cookeddmeat, especially liver, as is
€ygaard, 1940; Draper, 1977). The spears
practiced by the Inuit (Ho
€ ningen are an excellent example of an improved hunting
from Scho
technology, and the richness of butchery remains at the site shows

198

good access to animal resources (see also Dennell, 2013). Horsehide
might also have been exploited as protection against the cold
(Voormolen, 2008), and it is generally assumed that Neanderthals
(e.g., Wales, 2012) depended on clothing to survive winter. The
origin of clothing is still an open question since its preservation in
Paleolithic context is very improbable. However, studies of needles,
depictions, textile impressions, and the evolution of lice have
provided some indirect evidence for Paleolithic clothing (e.g.,
Adovasio et al., 1996; Soffer et al., 1998; Soffer, 2004).

5. Conclusion
References
Since James et al.'s (1989) early critique on the various claims for
human use and control of ﬁre in the Paleolithic literature, the
evaluation of evidence for ﬁre has been approached in a much more
circumspect manner and the associated human behavior is carefully classiﬁed into ﬁre use, control, sporadic use and control,
habitual use and control, and ﬁre production. However, many
claims for early use of ﬁre still rest on unsubstantiated assumptions
and “intuitive” claims. Our multianalytical, contextualized study at
€ ningen is an example of a refutation of such types of unsupScho
ported claims. Our analysis on purported hearths, burnt sediment,
wood, and lithic material, along with a critical reassessment of
€ ningen, clearly show that the site
other claims for ﬁre at Scho
complex does not serve as an example of human use or control of
ﬁre in the Lower Paleolithic.
In order to investigate the human mastery of ﬁre, archaeologists
must conduct a three-step evaluation of their data. First, the
researcher must demonstrate that the material evidence was either
produced or altered by ﬁre. As shown in this study, macroscopic,
qualitative evidence for heat alteration is often ambiguous but can
be veriﬁed with such techniques as micromorphology, Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, organic petrology, luminescence, and analysis of mineral magnetic parameters. Second, the
researcher must demonstrate that the heat alteration is related to
human activity and is not the result of a natural process (e.g., forest
ﬁre or lightning strike); a micro-contextual approach presents the
most promising tool. Third, the researcher must evaluate whether
the evidence suggests use of ﬁre, control of ﬁre, production of ﬁre,
or habitual use of ﬁre.
The lack of direct evidence for human use and control of ﬁre in
northern latitudes does not serve as evidence for absence of such
behavior, and it is still debatable if this lack of evidence is related to
poor preservation or to human behavior. Accepting the null hypothesis would mean that unless material is proven to be burnt, it is
not burnt, and that unless human ﬁre use can be proven, humans
did not use ﬁre. Accordingly, the present data set in Europe suggests
the absence of ﬁre use and control in the Lower Paleolithic.
More in-depth research along the lines used in this study is
needed to ﬁnd and evaluate evidence for early ﬁre use in northern
latitudes.
