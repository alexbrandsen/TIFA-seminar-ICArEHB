This paper compares archaeobotanical and other data from new excavations at two Upper Palaeolithic
sites d Dolní Vĕstonice II and Predmostí I d in the Moravian Corridor, Czech Republic. Both contain the
traces of broadly contemporary ‘Gravettian’ occupations during the warmer episodes of the Pleistocene
which preceded the last glacial maximum. Yet their archaeobotanical remains show striking differences
d those from Dolní Vĕstonice II being dominated by large quantities of conifer wood charcoal, while
those from Predmostí I are much more scanty and dominated by vitriﬁed plant remains, in association
with large quantities of burnt bone. We argue that these differences between these two datasets arise
from different uses of fuel at either site: bone at Predmostí I and wood at Dolní Vĕstonice II. Subsequently, we explore the possible reasons for this difference and argue that once likely taphonomic
distinctions are accounted for, these data on fuel use offer fresh insights into the functions and durations
of these Upper Palaeolithic occupations of the Moravian corridor and some possible implications for how
archaeobotanical data from such sites should be interpreted.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
The natural corridor, sometimes known as the Moravian Gate,
linking the Danube basin with the North European Plain through
the gap between the Carpathian Mountains to the east and the
Bohemian Plateau to the west, is a major source of sites for the
European Palaeolithic. This corridor constrained the movements of
early human communities and the animals they followed (see
Svoboda et al., 1994: 457). Archaeological sites along this corridor,
from the Palaeolithic onwards, enjoy remarkable preservation by
virtue of substantial deposits of loess, which accumulated here over
this deep time period during recurrent episodes of periglacial

conditions and which form some of the clearest terrestrial records
of the Quaternary climate.
Two such clusters of sites are at Dolní Vĕstonice and Predmostí,
each situated on the slopes of limestone outcrops and in close
proximity to rivers: the Dyje and Becva Rivers, respectively (see
Fig. 1). Previous excavations at both locations have revealed several
sites having in common the distinctive, imported ﬂint artefact
assemblage deﬁned as ‘Gravettian’, in association with hearth
features and accumulations of mammoth and other animal bones.
Famously, ﬁndings at Dolní Vĕstonice have also included assemblages of ﬁred-clay ﬁgurines and fragments associated with larger
hearths, human burials and some evidence of ephemeral
constructions (see, for instance, Svoboda, 1991; Svoboda et al., 1994,
2007; Oliva, 2000). These sites are interpreted to be vestiges of
Upper Palaeolithic hunteregatherer societies, who pursued
a largely mobile lifestyle following migratory animal herds through
the Moravian corridor during the various warm phases which
preceded the last glacial maximum, but who returned continually
to certain strategic sites, perhaps according to seasonal rounds (see
Trinkaus and Svoboda, 2006: 6).

The variability in the selection and use of fuel is one of the less
well-explored lines of evidence from Gravettian sites in the
Moravian corridor. At sites along the southern part of the corridor,
both burnt bone and wood charcoal are encountered. The hearths
stonice I, Milovice I
of apparently dense occupation such as Dolní Ve
and the more recently excavated Milovice IV, are ﬁlled predominantly with burnt bone, while those at sites of more dispersed
stonice II contain wood charcoal. At
occupations such as Dolní Ve
Predmostí I meanwhile d another site of dense occupation and the
key site of the central zone of Moravia, burnt bone predominates
across the site, both in the hearths of the main occupation area
excavated in the 19th Century (see Svoboda et al., 1994: 459), and in
the adjacent mammoth bone deposits, excavated recently. Further
to the north of the corridor, the site of Petrkovice also documents
a dominance of burnt bone over wood charcoal, but, interestingly,
a few fragments of local black coal were also identiﬁed in some of
the hearths.
In this paper we present new ﬂotation results from recent
excavations in two selected sites of different regions and types d
stonice II in the south of the Moravian corridor as a typical
Dolní Ve
site with a dominance of wood charcoal, and Predmostí I in the
centre, with a dominance of burnt bone, which we use to explore
these apparent contrasts in fuel use.
1.2. The potential of bone as a Palaeolithic fuel
Bone has been demonstrated to be an excellent fuel (see, for
instance, Kretzoi and Dobosi, 1990; Pullen, 2005) and its use as such
is noted in the ethnology of some contemporary, cold climate
hunteregatherer groups. Birket-Smith (1929), for instance, notes
that Eskimo groups of the Alaskan north coast burnt bones and

blubber, when their usual sources of arctic bell-heather (Cassiope
tetragona) and driftwood, are unavailable.
Indeed, the excavators of a number Lower and Middle Palaeolithic sites in Europe have interpreted quantities of burnt bone in
those sites, as evidence of its use as fuel. These include: Vértesszöllös, Hungary (see Kretzoi and Dobosi, 1990); La Cotte de St
Brelade, France (see Callow and Cornford, 1986); Abric Romaní,
Spain (see Pastó et al., 2000); Denisova Cave, Russia (see
Baryshnikov, 1999); and Starosele, Ukraine (see Burke, 2000).
Varying degrees of certainty, however, attend such interpretations,
not least because burnt bone may, of course, enter the archaeological record in a number of ways, including cooking, the disposal
of food debris for hygiene or avoiding of scavengers, the building
hearths on top of previously deposited bone, or indeed, forms of
ritual (see Cain, 2005: 874; Costamagno et al., 2005: 51). Nonetheless, Schiegl et al. (2003: 542), for instance, conclude that the
use of bone as fuel was a “common behavioural pattern during the
Middle and Upper Palaeolithic in Northern Europe”.
For the Upper Palaeolithic, Schiegl et al. (2003: 554) review
German Gravettian sites, arguing that “the prominence of burnt
bone and the lack of charcoal clearly indicate the routine use of
bone as a fuel”. Théry-Parisot et al. (2005: 50) review the evidence
for burnt bone in an extensive list of Upper Palaeolithic (Solutrean,
Magdalenian and, especially, Aurignacian) sites in France,
concluding that “the hypothesis that bone was used as fuel appears
to be the most likely, in view of the considerable amount if burnt
bones, their close association with combustion structures and other
contextual arguments speciﬁc to each deposit”. Importantly for our
purpose here, at almost all of these sites, wood charcoals were also
recovered, sometimes in considerable quantities. So, while ThéryParisot (2002a: 246), for instance, notes “massive use of animal

D.G. Beresford-Jones et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 37 (2010) 2799e2811

bones as fuel” at Abri Pataud, she observes also that this was
certainly not due to any absence of available wood (see also ThéryParisot, 2002b; Théry-Parisot et al., 2005). Indeed, she (2002a: 246)
concludes that, “it is necessary to be cautious when establishing
a correlation between the scarcity of wood and the use of other
types of fuel”.
2. Material and methods
The archaeobotanical data presented here unfold from a larger
investigation of human ecology during the Gravettian Period d the
‘Moravian Gate Project’ d a joint project between the Centre for
Palaeolithic and Palaeoethnological Research, Brno, Czech Republic
and the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University
of Cambridge, UK. The ﬂotation results discussed here come from
the excavations of the Moravian Gate Project at Dolní Vĕstonice in
2005 (‘DVII-05’), and Predmostí in 2006 (‘PMI-06’).
2.1. Dolní Vĕstonice II-05 excavations
The DVII-05 excavation was carried out on the edge of the Dolní
Vĕstonice II site cluster (see Svoboda et al., 2007). Following
archaeological investigation in the 1980s (see Svoboda, 1991), most
of the former Dolní Vĕstonice II site was removed, along with its
overlying and underlying loess deposits for the construction of
dams across the adjacent river valley bottom. However, these
Gravettian deposits continue along a steep extant bank. This site
(DVII-05) was prepared for excavation by the removal of its overburden loess deposits, thereby cutting a large step into the bank.
That loess overburden varied in depth from 6 m at the inner,
southern edge of this step to zero (the surface) at its northern, outer
edge. The surface of DVII-05 prepared for excavation, was divided
by a 6.5  8 m grid, further subdivided into 50 cm2 sub-quadrants
and labelled following the nomenclature of the original Dolní
Vĕstonice II excavation (see Fig. 2). This surface represented the
upper surface of Gravettian deposits deﬁned by the frequent
occurrence of distinctive grey ‘Gravettian’ ﬂint artefacts originating
from distant Polish sources, animal bones and a few concentrations
of charcoals (see Fig. 3). It showed a gentle inclination from north to
south and the Dolní Vĕstonice limestone outcrop against which its
loess matrix had been deposited. Excavation of all contexts proceeded by 10 cm deep spits because of great subtlety in distinction
between stratigraphic units. The site’s stratigraphy was further
clariﬁed through the initial excavation of two sections along its
southern and eastern edges (AeA0 and BeB0 , respectively in Fig. 2).
In section the Gravettian deposits were also deﬁned by a slight
change in colour from the very pale brown (10 YR 7/3) of their
sediment matrix to light brownish grey (10 YR 6/2) silt loam of the
deposits themselves. Once excavated, the largest charcoal concentration of DVII-05 turned out to be that of a single hearth context
(see Fig. 2). Indeed, microstratigraphy in thin sections prepared
from the rubiﬁed loess deposits underlying this context conﬁrm
that at least two, and likely three, distinct episodes of ﬁre making
had occurred in this hearth context, each separated by a signiﬁcant
period of time, probably years (Paine epersonal communication).
2.2. Predmostí I-06 excavations
Intense loess extraction for brick making has exposed Gravettian
sites in the vicinity of Predmostí in the 1880s (see Svoboda et al.,1994:
457). Today, the area is urbanised following the expansion of the
Predmostí suburb of the city of Prerov. Perhaps uniquely, however,
Gravettian deposits have been preserved under a modern cemetery
close to the limestone outcrop of Skalka, against which these loess
deposits were once accumulated. Local authorities and the Komenský

2801

Museum at Prerov therefore decided to build a small museum
pavilion on this location: the site of PMI-06. The surface of PMI-06 was
divided by a three by eight metrem grid, further subdivided into
50 cm2 sub-quadrants (see Fig. 2). The Gravettian deposits themselves
were deﬁned by a very similar ﬂint assemblage to that of DVII-05, in
association with a large quantity of mammoth and other animal bone,
many of which showed cut-marks from butchering (see Fig. 3). This
surface showed a gentle inclination from the southwest to the
northeast and the Skalka outcrop (see Svoboda, 2008).
Excavation proceeded by 10 cm deep spits for the same reasons
as at Dolní Vĕstonice. Since the main purpose was to expose the in
situ Gravettian deposits for display, excavation proceeded no
further than the upper surface of this layer over most of the site.
However, two, three by one metre trenches were necessary for the
foundations of the pavilion (P and L in Fig. 2) and these were
excavated through the Gravettian deposits.
Large quantities of burnt bone were recovered in the PMI-06
excavations. Almost half (19,876) of 40,318 bone fragments recovered were either charred or calcined (see Fig. 4). Of the total PMI-06
bone assemblage, 1021 have been identiﬁed, 971 (almost 90%) being
of mammoth (Nývltová Fisáková e personal communication).
2.3. Extraction and identiﬁcation of organic remains
Samples of all excavated (spit) contexts from DVII-05 and PMI06 were ﬂoated in the ﬁeld using a robust version of the standard
Cambridge Flotation Tank, which proved an effective way of
extracting charred organic remains from their ﬁne, massive loess
sediment contexts. Given the investigation’s aims, ﬂotation
samples were as large as possible: generally the entire excavated
context following the removal of larger ﬁnds. All sample volumes
were recorded before ﬂotation. Light fractions were separated by
a 500 mm and 2.0 mm sieve stack, dried in their sieves and then
packed for transport. Heavy fractions were sorted and recorded onsite. Once transported to the George Pitt-Rivers Archaeobotany
Laboratory all samples were slowly dried further in a drying oven
on minimum setting over 24 h (see Hather, 2000a: 74 for the
methods followed). Light fractions were then sorted and identiﬁed
under low and high power light microscopy.
Wood charcoals were identiﬁed using Phillips (1948),
Schweingruber (1978), Gale and Cutler (2000) and Hather
(2000b). All wood charcoal fragments were identiﬁed as
belonging to a relatively small range of conifer genera (dominated
by species of Pinus, Abies and Picea/Larix).
Since one of the main aims of the Moravian Gate Project is to
investigate the possible use of plant foods in these Gravettian Period
sites, particular attention was paid to the identiﬁcation of charred
parenchymous materials using the guidelines set forth by Hather
(1993: 3). However, as Hather (2000a) puts it, “the certain identiﬁcation of some fragments as parenchyma and, in almost all cases, the
precise identiﬁcation of this category of material, requires the use of
SEM”. Thus materials preliminarily identiﬁed as parenchyma were
then examined using a Scanning Electron Microscope (‘SEM’), at
which point some were conﬁrmed to be parenchyma, while others
were revealed to be damaged wood charcoal fragments.
Other charred plant remains identiﬁed from these samples were
vitriﬁed plant remains, identiﬁed by the glassy appearance of their
melted silica phytolith structures, a very few seeds, and some Abies
sp. leaves (‘needles’).
2.4. Sample selection
For the purpose of this paper samples were selected to allow, as
far as possible, for a broad comparison between the organic
remains of both sites. Thus, from PMI-06, six samples were chosen

from a descending set of spit contexts within Trench L, which, as
described above, descended through the Gravettian deposits.
Together, these six samples, deﬁne the depth of those deposits at
this location. Sample selection from DVII-05 was less spatially
restricted because the entire Gravettian deposit was excavated.

Thus six samples were selected arbitrarily from those deposits
across the excavation (see Fig. 2), but excluding the deﬁned hearth
context described above, in which charcoal concentrations were
obviously very high. Light fraction contents from these contexts are
sorted for the purpose of this study only according to broad,

unequivocal categories of identiﬁcation, namely: wood charcoals;
vitriﬁed charcoals; parenchyma charcoals; charred seeds; charred
needles; charred bone; and, unidentiﬁed charred fragments.
3. Results
Table 1 shows the results of the sorting of light fraction, charred
organic remains from DVII-05 and PMI-06. Table 2 shows some
calculated totals and means from each for the purpose of comparison between the two sites. These totals and means are determined
by combining the sorted results from 500 mm to 2 mm fractions for
each sample.
Fig. 5 shows a breakdown of the total count of charred remains
from the light fractions of both sites.
A direct comparison between the charred light fractions from
Dolní Vĕstonice II-05 and Predmostí I-06 conﬁrmed the impression
of a clear contrast between the two sites in terms of charred
material. The mean averages for charred plant material are
163.94 mg/l for Dolní Vĕstonice, and 0.59 mg/l for Predmostí,
a difference of four orders of magnitude. No wood charcoal fragments of greater than 2 mm (the size allowing for possible identiﬁcation) were obtained from PMI-06 samples, while those from
DVII-05 contained an average of 81.23 mg/l of such fragments.
The breakdowns of the sorted contents of the samples from
these sites also show striking differences (see Fig. 5). The total
charred, light fraction remains from the DVII-05 samples are 88%
conifer wood charcoals, with small quantities of charred parenchyma fragments and some seeds, a few with sufﬁcient remaining

morphology to be tentatively identiﬁed to family level. In contrast
the far more scanty total of charred, light fraction remains from
PMI-06 are only 35% wood charcoals but 42% vitriﬁed charred plant
remains, with more unidentiﬁable charred plant remains and small
amounts of charred parenchyma, charred Abies sp. needles and
charred bone.
No vitriﬁed plant remains, charred needles or charred bone
were observed in the light fractions from DVII-05. The latter
difference was evident even during excavation, for the majority of
the PMI-06 Gravettian surface is characterised by a large deposit of
mammoth bone, much of it charred. Unsurprisingly then, burnt
bone is the most common item in the heavy fractions of all the
samples from PMI-06 discussed here, with all but one sample
containing charred bone in the category ‘much’ (over 100 fragments). By contrast, the fewer bone fragments noted in the DVII-05
heavy fractions showed few signs of charring.
4. Discussion
The hearth features at Predmostí are described by Krí
z (1894,
1896, 1903, cited in Svoboda et al., 1994: 459), as: “depressions
artiﬁcially hollowed into the loess, and measuring 1e1.5 m in
diameter. Such a place is covered by ash, mostly of bones, with
a grey, dark grey or black colouration. In the ash and around, there
lie a number of larger burnt bone fragments.” Costamagno et al.
(2005: 60) observe that the hypothesis that bone has been used
as fuel is most strongly supported in deposits with highly fragmented assemblages showing both, a clear “dichotomy between

the percentage of determined burned bones and the percentage of
undetermined burned bones”, and an “abundance of calcined
bone”. These are precisely the characteristics of the total Predmostí
bone assemblage and, together with the 19th Century descriptions
of the site’s hearth contexts, strongly suggest that bone was indeed
burnt here as fuel.
The method of volumetric ﬂotation and the graded mesh
sizes used to extract the charred remains from the excavated
contexts of Predmostí I-06 and Dolní Vĕstonice II-05 were
identical. Clearly, because of the nature of that excavation, the
samples of the Gravettian deposits from PMI-06 necessarily
come from a more spatially conﬁned set of contexts than DVII05. Thus we have attempted a useful comparison with DVII-05

by selecting arbitrarily from within a much wider excavation
area of Gravettian deposits, whilst avoiding the only obvious
feature within that site: that of a hearth. Moreover, we are
comparing quite signiﬁcant volumes of samples: almost 220 and
45 L, respectively, of the Gravettian deposits of PMI-06 and
DVII-05.
What then might be the reasons for these seemingly stark
differences between the preserved remains in the Gravettian
deposits of Dolní Vĕstonice II-05 and Predmostí I-06? Is it simply
a matter of different fuel sources, wood and bone respectively, or do
the details of the results presented here suggest other factors
accounting for the difference in organic remains at the two sites?
We consider these in turn.

4.1. Burning bone e the absence of trees?
It might be that bone was used as fuel at Predmostí simply
because its prevailing climate was too cold and dry for trees. For the
European Upper Palaeolithic, vague impressions have long persisted of a relentlessly cold and treeless landscape, swept by periglacial winds throughout the Late Glacial (w42e18 ka BP). And yet,
as Willis and Van Andel (2004: 2370) put it, “no long palaeoecological sequences from central and eastern Europe (east of 10 )
exist to support this interpretation”. The generally cold conditions
of the Late Glacial are now understood to obscure considerable
variations across time and space (see Voelker, 2002) and pollen
stonice (see Svobodová, 1991) and
evidence from both Dolní Ve
Predmostí (see Svoboda et al., 1994) has been used to argue that
trees were present in these landscapes.
Indeed, in and of itself, the signiﬁcant quantities of wood charcoal in the DVII-05 Gravettian hearth context is clear evidence of
trees growing nearby (see Beresford-Jones, 2006). For while these
were highly mobile societies, moving and using resources over
great distances d such as ﬂints from Polish sources some 250 km
away d it is highly unlikely that these included signiﬁcant quantities of expendable, heavy wood fuel. Many studies have shown
that, in almost all cases, wood is gathered within a radius of not
more than two hours walking from the hearth site (see Willis and
Van Andel, 2004: 2371 for a useful summary). At Predmostí,
meanwhile, while some wood charcoal is present (35% of a total
count of light fraction charred remains), its quantity per litre of
sediment sampled is absolutely tiny. If the reason for this distinction was a simple absence of trees at Predmostí, the Gravettian
deposits at PMI-06 and DVII-05 must be separated in time, since
Predmostí is only some 90 km northeast of Dolní Vĕstonice.
Previously published calibrated radiocarbon dates from the
various ‘Gravettian period’ deposits of Dolní Vĕstonice II and
Predmostí I cover an enormous span of time, from 24,340  120 BP
(GrN 32641) to 28,300  300 BP (GrN-2092): the former being the
youngest date from Predmostí I-06, (see Svoboda, 2008), with the
latter being the oldest from Dolní Vĕstonice II, associated with
artefacts. The complete range of dates, including other Gravettian
sites at Dolní Vĕstonice is even greater, covering some ten

millennia, from 37,340  1280 BP to 23,820  380 BP (see Willis &
van Andel, 2004 for a useful summary). Yet, stripping out radiocarbon dates not pertinent to our comparison here, such as those
from Aurignacian or archaeologically sterile contexts dated for
purposes of palaeoclimatic reconstruction, leaves a much tighter
age range for the Gravettian occupations of Dolní Vĕstonice II and
Predmostí I (see Fig. 6). This is, moreover, also suggested by our
radiocarbon dates from the DVII-05 and PMI-06 excavations (see
Table 3). Nonetheless, with short DansgaardeOeschger climatic
oscillations at only the millennial scale (see for instance Dansgaard
et al., 1993, van Andel, 2003), and climate in particular places
further determined by numerous local control factors such as jet
stream variations and geology, the Gravettian sites of Dolní Vĕstonice and Predmostí, may still encompass considerable climatic,
and concomitant seasonal, variation. In short, while the environmental context is likely to have been variable and complex in both
space and time, a treeless landscape at Predmostí remains far from
proven.
4.2. Conifer needles as tinder?
While bone makes good fuel it requires a high-thermal ﬂux
before ignition can take place, therefore requiring some kind of
kindling (see Théry-Parisot, 2002b; Théry-Parisot et al., 2005 and
Pullen, 2005).
Around ﬁve percent of the assemblage from PMI-06 comprises
charred Abies sp. needles (see Fig. 5). Such needles are easily
combustible and typical of the types of tinder used by hunteregatherers (see Mears, 2004: 85e89 and Pullen, 2005). Fine needle
ﬁbres are excellent spark-catchers because they are well supplied
with oxygen and have less mass to be heated to reach ignition
temperature. While tinders are used to ignite ﬁres, they must
quickly be replaced with more substantial sources of fuel, such as
wood, or bone. Thus the small amounts of charred plant remains at
PMI-06 may represent vestiges of tinder used to initiate combustion. This possibility is resonant with the inference of Schiegl et al.
(2003: 556e7) for Gravettian sites in Germany: “while some plant
materials may have been used to start ﬁres they only form a minor
portion of the overall volume of fuel consumed”.

4.3. Differences in taphonomy?
The clear distinctions noted here between the charred assemblages from DVII-05 and PMI-06 might also be a taphonomic
outcome of the differences in combustion conditions that arise
from different fuel uses.
As shown in Fig. 5 one of these distinctions is the relatively high
proportion of vitriﬁed charred plant remains noted in the light
fractions of PMI-06. No vitriﬁed remains have been noted in any
DVII-05 assemblages.
Vitriﬁed plant remains are relatively rare, being most common in
much later ‘industrial’ contexts such as kilns, ovens and ﬂues from,
for instance, the RomanoeBritish period onward (Ballantyne d
personal communication) and Iron Age smelting kilns (see
Marguerie and Hunot, 2007: 1421), in which they note “the heat
needed to be stable and intense”, and way beyond those usually
attained in wood ﬁres, which reach temperatures of between 700
and 800  C (see McDonnell, 2001: 496e499).
Vitriﬁcation may occur in plant structures as their silica (silicon
dioxide) phytolith components melt and turn to a glassy-like
substance. In its most thermodynamically stable form of quartzite,
silica has a very high melting point of 1650 (75) C by virtue of its
tetrahedral crystalline structure. But in amorphous silicas such as
opal phytoliths and glass this crystalline structure is disrupted and
consequently, these have much lower melting points which will
vary depending upon the nature of additive chemicals and the
proportions of their amorphous ‘mineraloid’ structure that retain
vestiges of crystalline structure. Various glasses, for instance, melt
between 1000 and 1100  C. So while the precise conditions under
which different types of plant materials vitrify are currently
unknown, as Boardman and Jones (1990: 4) note, “silica is one of
the last constituents of certain plants to be affected by heat”, and
many have supposed that vitriﬁcation is caused by high temperatures (see McParland et al., 2010).
Yet recent experiments by McParland et al. (2010) suggest that
vitriﬁcation is not a straightforward function of temperature, but
rather inﬂuenced by several possible factors including the precombustion condition of wood and abrupt changes in the
combustion conditions within a ﬁre. In short, as Marguerie and
Hunot (2007: 1421) put it, “there appear to be numerous types of
conditions affecting fusion, and many anthracologists are currently
attempting to understand this phenomenon in all its respects”.
Might the high proportion of vitriﬁed charred remains in the
PMI-06 assemblage be accounted for by the use of fresh, greasy
bones as fuel? Extensive experimentation to compare bone and
wood fuel combustion has been carried out by Théry-Parisot et al.
(see Théry-Parisot, 2002b; Théry-Parisot et al., 2005 and

Costamagno et al., 2005). These suggest the temperatures reached
in ﬁres fuelled with ox (Bos taurus) bone ﬂuctuate between 650 and
970  C: only around 100  C higher and dropping off more rapidly,
than in wood ﬁres (see Théry-Parisot et al., 2005: Fig. 4 and
Costamagno et al., 2005). Other experiments also seem to show
that in ﬁres fuelled with a mixture of bone and wood and regardless
of the total mass of fuel, the duration of combustion is determined
by their relative proportions: “the higher the proportion of bone
the longer the combustion lasts” (Théry-Parisot, 2002b: 1417 and
see Fig. 2). Perhaps even more signiﬁcantly, the mechanisms of heat
transfer in bone ﬁres d largely of convection and radiation d are
very different to those of wood ﬁres, which are primarily of
conduction (see Théry-Parisot, 2002b; Théry-Parisot et al., 2005).
The ﬂame phase of mixed wood and bone ﬁres is considerably
longer than in wood ﬁres of equivalent fuel mass, so that ThéryParisot et al. (2005: 55) note that bone is preferable to wood as
fuel for those activities “which require the production of large
durable ﬂames”. Furthermore, there are also good reasons to
suspect that these distinctions between wood and bone ﬁres noted
in experiments using the bones of modern animals would be
considerably more exaggerated in ﬁres fuelled with mammoth
bone, which accounts for over 90% of the bone identiﬁed in the
PMI-06 excavations.
Fresh greasy bone might be expected to make better fuel than
dry bone (see Théry-Parisot, 2002b: 1416) because animal fat has
a high heat of combustion of 32 kJ/g, comparable to coal and almost
twice that of most woods (see DeHaan, 2008: 3). Surprisingly
however, Costamagno et al. (2005: Fig. 6.7) report little difference
between the respective intensities of combustion in experiments
burning fresh and dry ox bone. Yet the amounts of bone grease vary
signiﬁcantly between species and with season, and mammoth bone
could be expected to contain particularly high amounts of fat (see
Haynes, 1991 and Cordain et al., 2002: Fig. 2). Moreover, mammoth
bone is very large and, unsurprisingly enough, the temperature and
intensity of combustion of a ﬁre is strongly correlated with the
weight of bones burnt (see Théry-Parisot et al., 2005: 53).
A signiﬁcant proportion of the burned bone fragments from the
PMI-06 contexts was calcined (see Fig. 4B), indicating that they
were likely exposed to temperatures up to 940  C (see Devlin and
Herrmann, 2008: 111e112). Indeed, the very high proportion of
highly fragmented, so-called ‘indeterminate’ burned bone in the
PMI-06 assemblage is both evidence that bone was burned fresh
here (see Costamagno et al., 2005: Fig. 6.11), and that the resulting
ﬁre was of high intensity (see Stiner et al., 1995).
We suggest therefore that the vitriﬁed plant remains seen in the
PMI-06 samples may be the result of a rapid temperature gradient
in a mammoth bone ﬁre. The combustion conditions of such a ﬁre,

D.G. Beresford-Jones et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 37 (2010) 2799e2811

suggested by Théry-Parisot (2002b) and Théry-Parisot et al. (2005)
of a longer ﬂame phase producing intense convective and radiative
heat transfer d magniﬁed here through the use of large greasy
mammoth bones d might combine with McParland et al.’s (2010)
suggestion that vitriﬁcation may result from abrupt changes in
combustion conditions (see also Schweingruber, 1978 and
Marguerie and Hunot, 2007), to produce such a peculiar dataset for
an Upper Palaeolithic context. If so, the difference between the
DVII-05 and PMI-06 charred assemblages may be due entirely to
taphonomic reasons. For under these combustion conditions any
wood component of the PMI-06 ﬁres might leave little charcoal, but
only ash. Kretzoi and Dobosi (1990), for instance, report Vértes’s
experiments at the Lower Palaeolithic site of Vértesszöllös,
Hungary, to explain the lack of charcoal in hearths of burnt bone. A
ﬁre, kindled initially with wood and subsequently fuelled with
cattle bone, was buried beneath earth. Even under such reducing
conditions the ﬁre burnt for two days and “turned its wood entirely
into ash, easily blown away by the slightest puff of wind”.
5. Conclusions
This paper arose from a recurrent contrast in burnt organic
assemblages in Upper Palaeolithic Moravia, and the possibility that
wood was burnt where trees were available, and mammoth bone
burnt where they were not. A consideration of new evidence from
Dolní Vĕstonice and Predmostí has brought three new pieces of
information to light. First, the environmental situation is much
more complex, and the Predmostí landscape is unlikely to have
been devoid of trees. Second, at least some resources from those
trees, most visibly Abies needles, were clearly incorporated into the
Predmostí ﬁres. Third, the taphonomic evidence of vitriﬁcation
suggests that we cannot assume from the absence of charcoal the
absence of wood burning at Predmostí; the combustion conditions
of a ﬁre also fuelled with signiﬁcant quantities of bone may simply
not have allowed the creation and persistence of stable charcoal. In
short, the Predmostí ﬁres are likely to have incorporated both wood
and animal fuel. This, in turn, raises the question of why bone may
have been used for fuel, even when wood fuels were available.
Bone might, have been selected as fuel for purely expeditious
reasons, for even assuming that wood was equally available at both
Predmostí and Dolní Vĕstonice, there may well have been limitations to its supply. It is noteworthy that all the charcoals so far
identiﬁed from the rich DVII-05 contexts are of cold-adapted
conifer species from a limited range of genera: Pinus, Abies and
Picea/Larix (see Beresford-Jones, 2006). The only deciduous
exception to this assemblage, vastly dominated by conifers, is
a single fragment of Betula sp., another taxon tolerant of extreme
cold. Charcoals from a hearth represent an obvious anthropogenic
assemblage and there are many good reasons why conifer wood,
and pine in particular, might be selected preferentially by humans
for ﬁre making, including the occurrence of easily collected deadwood lower branches. Nonetheless, the absence of any thermophilous tree species recorded to date, within a very large assemblage
of charcoal from the DVII-05 hearth context, is highly suggestive
that generally cold conditions, but with signiﬁcant local variation
depending upon topography and season, prevailed at the time of
this particular Gravettian occupation (cf. Opravil, 1994).
Under this scenario, most of the landscape would have been
primary “mammoth steppe” (Guthrie and Kolfschoten, 2000: 13)
too dry for trees but supporting seasonal grasslands. Yet, within
river valleys, fed by seasonal melt-waters, boreal (or ‘taiga’) coniferdominated woodlands clearly persisted and even ﬂourished. This
landscape mosaic of both steppe and woodland, especially at the
water’s edge, would have provided the considerable plant biomass
necessary to underpin a seasonal food-web made up of the various

2809

species of large mammal evident in the bone assemblages from
Dolní Vĕstonice and Predmostí (see Musil, 2003; Huntley and Allen,
2003; Willis & van Andel, 2004). Such an environment would have
provided d seasonally d easily collected conifer deadwood for
fuel, but only in quantities that required energy to procure and
consequent strategies of resource conservation. Cutting down
larger, living green wood with the Gravettian tool kit would clearly
have expended considerable effort so that as Théry-Parisot et al.
(2005: 56) observe in such Palaeolithic landscapes “there is not
a wood shortage but a deadwood deﬁcit”. In cold, arid environments in which trees are slow growing, repeated visits would
gradually deplete local fuel wood resources, even over generational
time-scales (see Pullen, 2005).
In most circumstances, bone would never be more abundant
than wood and the notion of hunting to supply bone for fuel is
patently implausible, as Théry-Parisot et al. (2005: 57) point out,
noting that “the use of bone can therefore only be seen as an
occasional response to fuel pressure”. But Predmostí I is clearly in
the immediate vicinity of a kill site. It occupies an area of raised
cva River and the
ground within the active ﬂoodplain of the Be
quantities of bone here suggest that it was revisited repeatedly,
perhaps because mammoth could be more easily killed at this
location by being driven into soft ground. All its investigators have
remarked upon the abundance and size of the bone assemblages of
Predmostí (see, for instance Svoboda et al., 1994; Svoboda, 2006;
Soffer and Praslov, 1993; Musil, 2003 and Svoboda et al., 2005).
Soffer and Praslov (1993: 32), for instance, compare mammoth
numbers at all Gravettian sites in Moravia with an MNI of greater
than 10. Predmostí has signiﬁcantly more than any other, with an
MNI of over 1000. So the sheer quantity of fresh greasy mammoth
bone that was potentially immediately available at Predmostí may
have led to it having been used as fuel for entirely opportunistic
reasons.
Bone might, however, have been selectively used over wood for
fuel because ﬁres produced from different fuels have different
qualities, which can be put to different purposes. Different types of
ﬁre are needed for differing types of food preparation, scaring off
predators or as part of hunting strategies (see, for instance, ThéryParisot, 2002a and Mears, 2004). From ethnographic evidence, it
would seem that many recent hunteregatherer groups prefer small
ﬁres because they are more easily controlled, expend less fuel, and
allow people to congregate about them without being scorched
(see Pullen, 2005). Yet these would seem to be unlikely features of
the ancient mammoth bone ﬁres of Predmostí, for since bone ﬁres
do not produce embers and are ineffective in heat transfer by
conduction they would be unlikely to be used for indirect cooking
or to maintain heat during the night. Rather, the combustion of
bone favouring heat transfer by convection and radiation would be
useful for “lighting, drying or curing” (Théry-Parisot et al., 2005:
55): purposes of clear utility in the vicinity of a kill site like
Predmostí, at which light might be needed and from which scavengers would need to be deterred, during the long hours of processing carcasses and hides as rapidly as possible. Indeed, burning
large bones may also have been useful for the extraction of their
marrow fat, of particular dietary importance to people whose
protein intake is derived largely from meat (see Outram, 2001:
401).
Théry-Parisot et al. (2005: 57) further observe that “on a base
camp type site, where all forms of activity are represented, the
demands for fuel are numerous and diverse. Consequently, bone
can neither in quantity, nor in quality, satisfy all these needs. If it is
used, it is always done so for specialised activities and in
conjunction with wood or other fuels. In other words, the settlements in which burnt bone is numerous are probably sites of
temporary occupation”. At face value this observation might seem

2810

D.G. Beresford-Jones et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 37 (2010) 2799e2811

to sit uneasily with the wider Gravettian record of the Moravian
corridor, for while bone might appear be the fuel of choice at sites
of intense occupation such as Predmostí I, wood charcoal seems
associated with sites of more dispersed occupation such as Dolní
Vĕstonice II. And yet our closer analysis of fuel use here suggests
ways in which its logic could, indeed, be used to elaborate our
understanding of these sites.
The excavations of Dolní Vĕstonice II-05 reveal one part of
a wider occupation dispersed across the north-western slopes of
the Pavlov Hills, including hearths, human burials and hints of
perhaps two kinds of ephemeral structure (see Svoboda, 1991;
Svodoba, 2007). The vantage enjoyed from here over the Dyje
Valley would have made it an obvious location for mobile hunteregatherer societies to revisit and indeed, the DVII-05 hearth shows
evidence that many ﬁres were set here, each separated by signiﬁcant periods of time. In all these respects then, Dolní Vĕstonice II
might ﬁt the characterisation of a ‘base-camp’, at which the
conductive heat transfer of wood ﬁres would have been used for
cooking and warmth.
Meanwhile, lying less than 5 km from Dolní Vĕstonice II is the
site of Milovice I, which would seem to share many of those
features we have noted at Predmostí I d deposits containing
thousands of mammoth bones, sited lower down within river
valleys at speciﬁc points at which mammoth might be more easily
trapped and killed, or scavenged d so that both Predmostí I and
Milovice I would seem to be occupations for precisely that purpose
(see Svoboda et al., 2005). While their archaeological remains
therefore seemingly represent more intensive occupations than
those of Dolní Vĕstonice II, they are also likely the palimpsests of
many occupations in these precise locations. Oliva (2009: 311), for
instance, describes Milovice I as the “location of temporary camp
sites perhaps repeatedly settled by groups of . hunters”. The ﬂame
properties of bone ﬁres would have had clear efﬁcacy at such sites.
Their occupation, for the purpose of processing large numbers of
herd animals from adjacent kill-sites, would necessarily each have
been of relatively short duration: it being both dangerous and
unpleasant to have tarried long in the vicinity. Consequently,
Predmostí and Milovice may ﬁt rather better Théry-Parisot et al.’s
characterisation of ‘temporary occupation’ d albeit re-occupied
with greater frequency d than sites such as Dolní Vĕstonice II. In
a cold, dry environment, repeated visits may have gradually
depleted immediate wood resources, perhaps even over generational time-scales. And, unlike at Dolní Vĕstonice II, mammoth
bone was a fuel of choice at both sites.
These observations then usefully illustrate how a closer
understanding of fuel use can offer us fresh insights into the
functions and durations of these ancient occupations and, indeed,
into the lifeways which enabled these Gravettian societies to
expand into these hitherto marginal ecologies during the Late
Glacial (see Jones, 2009). Yet those understandings can only begin
to be reached by adopting appropriate archaeobotanical methods
in Upper Palaeolithic excavations so that their records of preserved
charred plant remains can be studied in sufﬁcient detail and the
likely taphonomic distortions of those records also be properly
accounted for.
