Wood exposed to a heat source can be transformed into charcoal if subject to conditions of carbonisation
(in the absence of air) or charring (in restricted air). Charcoal recovered from archaeological sites can
yield fundamental information to our understanding of human economic and cultural development over
time and (ecological) setting. This work describes the morphological (anatomy, degree of shrinkage),
physical (reﬂectance) and chemical (elemental, molecular composition) properties of charcoal in relation
to heat source and wood variables. In this study charcoal and charcoal fuel were experimentally produced whereby temperature (160–1200  C), time of exposure (2–1440 min), heating rate (high and low)
and wood type (angiosperm and conifer) were varied. The results show that charcoal, often described as
an inert, black material, has different chemical and physical properties in relation to the investigated
variables. By using these different properties it is possible to distinguish between the different types of
ﬁres (domestic and industrial) exploited by humans in the past. Morphological analyses and reﬂectance
measurements are effective tools for this purpose and can be used in wood exposed to temperatures of
300  C and abovedtemperatures which are relevant to archaeological research. Angiosperm and conifer
wood react in different ways when exposed to heat and thus the taxonomic identity of archaeological
material needs to be known. Chemical analyses can be used for wood exposed to temperatures below
400  C whereas elemental analyses of the carbon content can be used for wood exposed to temperatures
up to a maximum of 650  C.

1. Introduction
Wood has evolved over hundreds of millions of years to become
arguably the most remarkable structural material on earth and for
this reason has become an invaluable economic commodity for
human society. The slow decomposition rate allows wood to remain in the soil for a number of years. However, over timescales of
decades to millennia and, depending upon factors such as humidity, temperature, relative chemical composition and soil type (e.g.
van der Wal et al., 2007), wood eventually succumbs to decomposition and is often lost from the historical record altogether.
Nevertheless even though the archaeological record is relatively
poor in wood per se, it contains a relatively rich record of charcoaliﬁed material, including wood. Charcoaliﬁed material is able to
overcome both the physical and chemical decomposition associated with burial in the soil, and is thus the most common mode of
survival of archaeological plant debris, whilst retaining the physical
structure of the original material. Charcoal residue is therefore an

important source of information in helping our understanding of
human economic and cultural developments over time. Although
charcoaliﬁed wood is often abundant in archaeological sites, little is
known regarding the morphological, physical and chemical
changes associated with the charcoaliﬁcation process of wood
itself, even though such changes associated with carbonized
fruits and seeds have been studied in detail (Braadbaart, 2004;
Braadbaart et al., 2007, Braadbaart, 2008). Therefore we have undertaken a series of experiments aimed at increasing our knowledge regarding the changes associated with heating both wood and
charcoal as a fuel, and thus being able to deﬁne the term charcoal in
the archaeological context. Subsequently we explore the possibility
of being able to retrieve information, additional to local vegetation
composition and possible sivicultural practices for example, relevant to human activity in the past. A prerequisite to understanding
the changes associated with charcoaliﬁcation is a basic understanding of the morphological, physical and chemical characteristics of modern wood. These characteristics are summarized
below.
Wood can be subdivided into two main types depending upon
its biological origin. Softwood, derived from conifers, is comprised
predominantly of axial tracheids, which in turn is composed of

F. Braadbaart, I. Poole / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 2434–2445

25–35% lignin, 37–45% cellulose and 20–25% hemicellulose. Hardwood, derived from angiosperms, is morphologically more complex
generally comprising up to ﬁve different axial elements including
parenchyma, ﬁbres and, most notably, vessels. The chemical composition of the elements in angiosperm wood also differs from that
of conifer wood with generally a lower proportion of lignin (20–
25%) occurring in angiosperm wood coupled with a higher hemicellulose content (20–35%) and similar proportions of cellulose
(39–45%) (Sjöström, 1993; Blanchette, 2000). However, proportions
can vary further, both within and between species, depending upon
factors that can include mechanical (e.g. reaction wood) or ecological
(e.g. arid habitat) stress, etc. (e.g. Meier, 1964; Malik et al., 2004).
Within the lignin fraction further differences exist between
softwoods and hardwoods. Lignins are classiﬁed according to the
relative amounts of guaiacyl (2-methoxyphenol), syringyl (2,6dimethoxyphenol) and p-hydroxyphenyl monomers (Van der Hage
et al., 1993). In general conifer lignin is composed primarily of
guaiacyl monomers whereas angiosperm lignin is characterized by
the presence of both guaiacyl and syringyl monomers.
Charcoal is considered to be an inert, black material, with
morphological properties similar to that of modern wood, yet an
exact deﬁnition is lacking (Connor et al., 1994; Antal et al., 1996;
Kim and Hanna, 2006). Charcoal formation (charcoaliﬁcation) occurs either by heating wood in a limited supply of air (oxygen) (i.e.
charring), or in the absence of air (oxygen) (i.e. carbonization). In
the literature these three terms have been used interchangeably
and it is therefore necessary to clarify the distinctiondthe differences have been summarized in Fig. 1. Importantly the residues
formed by these different heating processes can have different
chemical and physical properties (Braadbaart, 2004).
On heating, wood constituents thermally decompose and volatiles are released. If air (oxygen) is present the volatiles can ignite
and begin to burn producing the characteristic ﬂame and giving the
appearance of burning wood. In an abundant supply of air (oxygen)
the wood will combust to form an ash end product, but under
conditions of limited or no oxygen, charcoal will be formed (see
Fig. 1).
The morphological, physical and chemical properties of charcoal
can differ depending upon two main variables associated with the
heating process (Braadbaart et al., 2007; Braadbaart, 2008): (1) heat
source related variables, which include temperature, time of exposure and heating rate ( C/min); and (2) wood property variables,
which include taxon, size, thermal conductivity and porositydvariables that can also change during the charcoaliﬁcation
process itself. With increasing temperature the initial changes to
occur are: (1) morphologicaldthe darkening of the wood which
ultimately becomes black; (2) physicaldconsiderable mass loss,
shrinkage, and possible anatomical distortion, of the original
material resulting from the formation and loss of many volatiles;
and (3) chemicaldthe continuous and gradual conversion of the
cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin to predominantly aromatic
moieties, and thereby forming a new chemically-distinct, carbonenriched end product (Shaﬁzadeh, 1982; Boon et al., 1994;
Braadbaart, 2004; Braadbaart et al., 2007).
With regard to the heating variables, human-related heating
regimes can be divided into those that are domestic and those that
are industrial. In the former, temperatures are usually relatively low
and wood is used as the fuel. At the outset the heating rate of
a domestic ﬁre will be low, but later once the ﬁre is established the
heating rate of further wood fuel will increase. In this type of ﬁre,
wood is exposed to air and undergoes charring with the most likely
end product being ash that is of little use to archaeologists. If this
process is interrupted (e.g. dousing with water or not stoking the
ﬁre) then charring is often incomplete and charcoal can result.
Industrial processes required ﬁres of much higher temperatures
relative to their domestic counterpart. Required temperatures

Fig. 1. Schematic diagram showing the main processes (dotted boxes) by which
charcoal is produced from wood in archaeological contexts. On heating, volatiles are
released and one of two processes can occur: (1) in the absence of air (oxygen) carbonization takes place at minimum temperatures w300  C. (2) If a limited supply of air
(oxygen) is present, charring takes place with released volatiles igniting to produce
ﬂames (if there is a pilot heat source ignition occurs at w350  C, otherwise spontaneous ignition occurs at w600  C). At temperatures normally present in domestic ﬁres,
total combustion results in the formation of ash. If combustion is interrupted (e.g.
dousing with water, ﬁre left to extinguish or removal of material from the ﬁre) the
temperature will drop below w350  C, no further volatiles are released and the end
product will be charcoal rather than ash. Together processes (1) and (2) can be termed
charcoaliﬁcation. Note that indicated temperatures depend upon length exposure and
in archaeological situations length of exposure is taken as more than 15 min (see text
for details).

ranged from 500 to 1200  C depending upon the purpose. When
temperatures in excess of 900  C were required charcoal, with its
higher caloriﬁc value, was the preferential fuel. In the presence of
air (introduced via bellows for example), charcoal is capable of
producing an intense heat about twice that of wood (Armstrong,
1978) and in this way a charcoal fuelled ﬁre can attain temperatures
of around 1300  C within 15 min. However, the charcoal fuel ﬁrst
had to be prepared in a separate industrial process where wood was
heated, in the absence of air, to temperatures of w500  C where it
underwent carbonisation to form charcoal.
The charcoal remains found in archaeological sites can provide
important information pertaining to not only local vegetation and
sivicultural practices but also temperature at which it was formed
and thus ﬁre type and human activity. It is the experimental formation of these charcoal remains that form the subject of this
study. Charcoal derived from natural heat sources such as wild ﬁres
and hot pyroclastic ﬂows in volcanic contexts are beyond the scope
of this study.
In order to investigate more fully the inﬂuence of both heat
source- and wood property related variables, a series of controlled
experiments were undertaken to explore the chemical, physical
and morphological properties of wood and whether such changes
can be used to help interpret archaeological contexts. Angiosperm
and conifer wood samples were heated using different regimes
under experimental conditions. Previous studies (Braadbaart,
2004) have shown that experimental carbonization of fruits and
seeds are similar to traditional methods for charcoal production

2436

under less controlled conditions (e.g. an open ﬁre). Open ﬁre situations, simulating those found in archaeological contexts where
conditions would have been less controlled, were also studied with
both wood and charcoal being used as a fuel. This was undertaken
to ensure that these controlled experimental procedures produced
data for wood material that were comparable with data derived
from archaeologically formed wood material, and in turn that
general conclusions drawn from this study could be applied to archaeologically derived charcoal. Finally, the results from this study
are applied to charcoal from archaeological sites with known
contextual data to determine the feasibility of using the analytical
approach to archaeological charcoal in this way.
2. Material
2.1. Modern samples
Wood of pine (Pinus sylvestris) and oak (Quercus robur) are often
found in archaeological sites in Europe and therefore these taxa
were selected for this study. In some experiments wood of yew
(Taxus baccata), birch (Betula pendula), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus)
and walnut (Juglans regia) were used as supplementary material
and/or to verify the results obtained from the pine and oak samples,
respectively. Wood samples of all taxa were taken from the trunks
of trees, of similar age and with no evidence of damage or injury,
originally growing in a forest along the North Sea coast in Heemstede, the Netherlands. From the heartwood, cubes measuring
20  5  5 mm were taken and left to dry for 1 month. For each
experiment two such cubes were used to check for consistency in
the results.
Charcoal fuel was obtained from a traditional charcoal kiln
(‘meiler’) from Chr. Wagener, Netphen (Germany). For experiments
in the laboratory where knowledge of the temperature was required, charcoal was made by heating oak wood in a preheated
oven (to 450  C) and allowed to cool to ambient temperature
(w20  C).

Netherlands) where temperatures were in excess of 600  C. The
charcoal end product was used for comparative purposes.
Samples of charcoal fuel were prepared experimentally in the
laboratory by heating oak wood using the procedure outlined below. These samples were subsequently used to determine the effect
of heating on charcoal fuel. In addition, charcoal fuel samples of
oak, walnut and hornbeam, made in a traditional charcoal kiln (cf.
Armstrong, 1978), were used for comparative purposes.
3.2. Time of exposure and mass loss
Initial experiments were undertaken on modern oak wood
samples to determine an optimal time of exposure to heat taking
into consideration the reasonable duration of ﬁres in archaeological
situations. To do this, oak samples were placed in the preheated
oven and heated to 280, 310, 370, 440, 600 and 800  C for time
intervals ranging from 2 to 1440 min. Separate samples were used
for each time interval. Mass loss for each sample was calculated
from the difference between the mass of the cooled treated material and the untreated material and expressed as a percentage.
These mass losses were plotted as a function of time on a logarithmic scale. The time beyond which no further sharp mass loss
occurred, at temperatures relevant to this study (i.e. >300  C), was
taken as the point at which thermal conversion had been completed and therefore the optimum time of exposure (see Section 4
for details). The optimal time was taken as 60 min and was used for
subsequent experimental procedures.
Further experiments investigating difference in mass loss between angiosperms and conifers were undertaken whereby samples were heated at the high heating rate to temperatures ranging
from 160  C to 1200  C for 60 min (see Sections 3.3 and 3.4 for
details). This was then repeated using the low heating rate (Section
3.3) for 60 min at 250, 280, 310, 370, 400, 440, 500, 600, 700 and
900  C. The results from the two heating rates and different taxa
were then compared.
3.3. Heating rate

2.2. Archaeological samples
The archaeological material investigated includes charcoal
samples recovered from archaeological excavations within the
Netherlands, namely a hearth pit in Schipluiden (3600–3300 BC);
a burnt grain silo in Maastricht (650 AD); a burnt wooden shed in
Tiel (150–220 AD); a mesolithic tar production site near Hattummerbroek. In addition samples from a Medieval ‘tandir’ bread oven
and two hearth pits from Girag Kasaman, Azerbaijan were also
studied.

Two heating protocols were investigated: (1) high heating rate
(HHR) where wood samples were placed directly into a preheated
oven and heated for 60 min, to simulate fuel being added to an
existing ﬁre; (2) low heating rate (LHR) where wood samples were
placed into an oven at ambient temperature, heated to a preselected ﬁnal temperature in 120 min and kept at this ﬁnal
temperature for 60 min, to simulate heating a starter fuel. Results
from the two heating regimes were compared.
3.4. Temperature

3. Methods
3.1. Experimental charcoal production
The procedure of Braadbaart (2004) was adopted to experimentally carbonize wood under controlled conditions. Wood
samples were heated in a Carbolite tube oven (model MTF 12/38/
250) at atmospheric pressure under a constant ﬂow of nitrogen
(150 ml/min) to ensure anoxic or reducing conditions. The samples
were placed in an open PyrexÓ vessel and inserted into a 30 cm long
Pyrex tube (B 2.3 cm) at 18 cm from the inlet. To prevent melting, at
temperatures >1000  C a ceramic tube and vessel were used.
Resultant gases and volatiles were vented and not investigated
further. The inﬂuence of the heat source related variables namely
temperature, heating rate and time of exposure were regulated as
described below.
Wood samples were also heated in traditionally managed open
industrial ﬁres in the archaeological theme park Archeon (the

For the modern wood samples a number of pre-selected ﬁnal
temperatures were investigated, namely 160, 220, 250, 280, 310,
320, 340, 370, 400, 440, 500, 600, 650, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100
and 1200  C.
Laboratory-produced charcoal fuel was made by heating oak
wood at the LHR to a ﬁnal temperature of 450  C and left for 60 min.
Samples were allowed to cool and then reheated using the HHR to
ﬁnal temperatures of 800, 900, 1000, 1100 and 1200  C for 60 min.
3.5. Morphological analyses
Charcoal samples made using the two different heating protocols and different ﬁnal temperatures along with charcoal fuel
heated to temperatures from 800  C up to a maximum of 1200  C,
were prepared for microscopical study using standard techniques
(Gale and Cutler, 2000). Anatomical structures were examined
using epi-illumination under an Olympus BX41 microscope.

F. Braadbaart, I. Poole / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 2434–2445

The degree of shrinkage can also be indicative of ﬁnal temperature and has been used to help determine original seed size and
artefacts (Braadbaart, 2008), or anatomical character(s) which in
turn have helped reconstruct palaeoecology (although not without
difﬁculty). Therefore degree of shrinkage was also investigated in
the oak wood samples. The mean of 25 tangential diameters of the
ﬁrst formed, large early wood vessels of each oak charcoal sample
prepared, using the two heating protocols and different ﬁnal temperatures, were measured. Degree of shrinkage was expressed by
plotting the mean diameter of the early wood vessels in each
charcoal specimen as the percentage of the mean diameter of the
early wood vessels in the unheated (fresh) oak wood sample
against ﬁnal temperature.
3.6. Physical analyses
The reﬂectance (%Ro) of charcoaliﬁed organic material provides
information regarding the temperature at which the material became charcoaliﬁed (Braadbaart, 2004). Reﬂectance is deﬁned as the
percentage of vertically incident monochromatic light reﬂected
from a highly polished surface of a sample calibrated against the
light reﬂected from a standard of known reﬂectance. To determine
relative reﬂectance and any taxonomic differences, the three planes
of section (transverse, radial longitudinal and tangential longitudinal) were studied for each specimen of: (1) experimentally
produced charcoal from oak, birch, pine and yew wood, heated at
the HHR and a ﬁnal temperature of 310–1200  C; (2) charcoal fuel
(oak wood), which was subsequently exposed to ﬁnal temperatures
ranging from 800–1200  C; and (3) archaeological charcoal
specimens.
Material was embedded in resin blocks and polished. Reﬂectance was measured under oil immersion at a wavelength of
546 nm using a Leitz motorized DMLA microscope equipped with
an xyz-stage and a Basler video camera. For each specimen a total of
100 randomly performed reﬂectance readings were taken (to obtain a statistically acceptable population) and the mean reﬂectance
of each specimen calculated. Preparation of polished blocks and
reﬂectance measurements were performed in accordance with
standard methods deﬁned in ISO 7404, part 2 (1985) and ISO 7404,
part 5 (1994).
This study was then extended to determine the inﬂuence of
exposure time on reﬂectance values of oak and pine samples heated
at the HHR for 15 min and 24 h at 370, 440, 600 and 800  C and
compared with the results obtained for heating at the ﬁnal
temperature (up to 1200  C) for 60 min.
3.7. Chemical analyses
3.7.1. Elemental analyses
Differences in the elemental (carbon) composition of treated
oak wood samples relative to untreated oak wood were investigated. Each specimen was ground to a ﬁne powder and subjected to a carbon analysis using a Fisons Instruments NA 1500
series 2 NCS analyser. The temperature in the combustion reactor
was maintained at 1020  C. The combustion products were separated on a Porapak QS column with a length of 2 m. All values stated
are based on singular measurements corrected for water and ash
content. To calculate the carbon content as dry and ash free (daf),
the water and ash content were determined on a Thermogravimetric Analyser TGA 2950 Hi-Res. The carrier gas was air and the
heating rate was set at 25  C/min, water content was determined at
105  C and ash content at 960  C.
3.7.2. Molecular analysis
Differences in molecular composition of heated wood samples
relative to unheated wood were investigated using direct

2437

temperature-resolved mass spectrometry (DTMS) with a JEOL SX102A double focusing mass spectrometer (B/E) with a direct insertion probe equipped with a Pt/Rh (9/1) ﬁlament for analysis
under electron impact (EI) conditions. Powdered samples of unheated and heated oak and pine wood were placed on the ﬁlament
and inserted directly into the ion source of the mass spectrometer.
Under EI conditions ions were generated by low voltage electron
ionization (16 eV) in an ionization chamber kept at 180  C and accelerated to 10 kV. The scan range was m/z 20–1000 with 1 s cycle
time and mass resolution of 1000 and 3000. Data were acquired
using a JEOL MP-7000 data system. Since previous measurements
on residues of peas, wheat grains and sunﬂower achenes showed
that the sampling and experimental variance was very small
(Braadbaart, 2004), only single measurements were performed for
each sample.
3.8. Archaeological simulation of fuel exposure to heat
Oak wood is known from archaeological settings to have been
used as a fuel for domestic cooking ﬁres (e.g. Gale and Cutler,
2000). Therefore oak wood and charcoal fuels were used to investigate the heating process in a traditional open ﬁre. A ﬁre was
lit and left to burn for 1 h during which time the ﬁre was stoked to
simulate a cooking ﬁre. After burning for one hour the heat at the
centre of a cooking ﬁre was determined by measuring the
temperature of a piece of wood situated in the middle of the ﬁre
(800  C) using a thermocouple. A piece of oak fuel wood was
subsequently placed in the ﬁre and once it had also reached
800  C it was left for 15 min and subsequently removed. Reﬂectance was then measured using the procedure outlined above.
Three pieces of charcoal fuel produced in a traditional charcoal
kiln were placed in a ﬁre prepared for bronze smelting. Once they
had reached the desired temperature of w1200  C they were left
for a further 15 min before removal. Reﬂectance was then measured
using the procedure outlined above. These samples were then used
to compare results derived from the archaeological charcoal with
the results from the controlled heating experiments.
4. Results
4.1. Time of exposure
The optimal time of exposure to ensure carbonization of the
wood material was determined from the mass loss of oak samples
heated using the HHR protocol at 280, 310, 370, 440, 600 and
800  C plotted as a function of time (black squares, Fig. 2). At 280
and 310  C no constant mass loss is reached even after 6 h
(360 min). However samples heated at 370 and 440  C, show an
initial rapid mass loss followed by a considerably reduced mass loss
after approximately 10 min. After 60 min heating to all temperatures above 310  C, no further signiﬁcant loss in mass occurred and
therefore this time was taken to be the optimal time of exposure.
4.2. Mass loss
Difference in mass loss between taxa (pine versus oak) and
heating regime (HHR versus LHR) at different temperatures is
plotted in Fig. 3a,b. In all cases initial mass loss was rapid with
w60% of the mass being lost over the 220–310  C temperature
range (Fig. 3b). From 310  C up to w400  C mass loss continued but
at a lower rate which decreased still further from 400  C to 1200  C
(Fig. 3a). At 1200  C the total mass loss reached 75–85%, but does
not become constant.
Taxonomic identity also incurs a difference in mass loss. In the
temperature range 160–350  C oak wood exhibits a greater mass

4.3. Morphological analyses
4.3.1. Low heating rate
Up to temperatures of w300  C the wood characteristics change
little from that of untreated wood (Table 1). The colour becomes
increasingly dark but the texture and properties are essentially that
of wood rather than charcoal. Between 310 and 370  C the physical
properties of the wood undergo a change from being essentially
wood-like to becoming typically charcoal-like. This was accompanied by a more pronounced colour change (dark brown to black),
ability to break the specimen by hand (not possible to possible),
weight/mass change (becoming relatively light in weight), degree
of reﬂectance under epi-illumination (non-reﬂective to reﬂective)
and its friability (non-friable to friable). In the oak material this was
also accompanied by an anatomical change whereby the characteristic multiseriate rays can appear ‘exploded’ as if a sudden release of pressure had occurred through this region of relatively
weak tissue. This was not observed in the pine, probably due to the
rays being only one cell wide. A further physical change occurs
above 600  C such that by 800  C the anatomy can appear distorted,
and increasingly so with increasing temperature. By 900  C the
charcoal has become powdery and fragments easily. By 1000  C the
anatomy is deformed and by 1200  C the anatomy is no longer
recognizable.
4.3.2. High heating rate
As with the LHR, up to temperatures of w300  C the characters
of both oak and pine wood changed little from that of untreated
wood (Table 1). Although the colour became increasingly dark
again the texture and properties are essentially that of wood
rather than charcoal. The exception to this generalisation is oak
wood at temperatures above 250  C where the sample became

due to the absence of the multiseriate (sometimes aggregated)
rays, and thus lines of weakness, along which fracturing was able
to occur in oak. Between 310 and 370  C the physical properties of
the wood underwent a change from being essentially wood-like
to becoming typically charcoal-like. This was accompanied by
a colour change, albeit not as pronounced as in the LHR (dark
brown to black), ability to break it by hand (not possible to
possible), weight/mass change (becoming relatively light), degree
of reﬂectance under epi-illumination (non-reﬂective to reﬂective)
and its friability (non-friable to friable). Moreover the ‘exploded’
rays in the oak sample were also observed at this temperature. By
800  C the anatomy of both the oak and the pine had become
distorted and by 900  C the texture was distinctly powdery. By
1000  C the anatomy was deformed and by 1200  C the anatomy
was no longer recognizable.

4.3.3. Fuel charcoal prepared at 450  C
The wood samples that were heated to 450  C and then allowed
to cool before heating to a range of temperatures between 800 and
1200  C all retained the anatomy of charcoal heated to around
450  C regardless of the ﬁnal temperature to which it was exposed.
They were black in colour, obviously charcoal but fractured easily
by hand yet were not powdery or excessively friable. The anatomy
was intact and reﬂectance was relatively high.
The glassy or vitriﬁed charcoal as for example described by
Marguerie and Hunot (2007) were not found in the charcoal produced under the present experimental conditions. However,
a glassy product with chemical composition of tar (Braadbaart,
unpublished data), with no morphological structure, similar to that
described by Marguerie and Hunot (2007) was formed along side
the charcoal specimens.
4.3.4. Degree of shrinkage
The results (Fig. 4) indicate that initial shrinkage was more
pronounced when heated at the HHR relative to the LHR. However, at temperatures above 370  C the relative shrinkage was
similar for both heating regimes. For wood specimens initially
heated to 450  C to form charcoal, then reheated to a ﬁnal
temperatures above 800  C the shrinkage was similar to that
observed by the wood heated directly to that ﬁnal temperature
using, in particular, the low heating rate. Vessel diameter of
specimens subjected to the HHR to ﬁnal temperatures above
900  C could not be used due to the extensive anatomical disruption (Table 1).

4.4. Physical analysis
Reﬂectance measurements were taken from oak, birch, pine and
yew samples heated at ﬁnal temperatures ranging up to 1200  C
(Fig. 5) and on samples of (oak) charcoal fuel material.
From Fig. 5 it can be seen that reﬂectance measurements
taken from oak samples are consistently greater than the pine
samples over the whole range of investigated temperatures. This

taxonomic difference in reﬂectance is slightly greater in lower
temperature range (up to 500  C) but decreases at temperatures
above 600  C. To verify this difference, samples of a second
angiosperm (birch) and conifer (yew) sample was heated using
the same protocol to ﬁnal temperatures of 440, 600 and 900  C.
Reﬂectance measurements of these samples again showed that
conifer woods have a lower reﬂectance value than angiosperm
material when exposed to the same ﬁnal temperature. Moreover, at temperatures >800  C these differences are also
reduced.
Using the HHR regime, modern oak and pine wood samples
heated to 310  C had reﬂectance measurements for 0.40 and 0.20,
respectively. Reﬂectance values steadily increase to w6.5%Ro at
1200  C. However the increase in reﬂectance of material subject to
temperatures above 400  C is more rapid per increase in temperature when compared with the reﬂectance of material subject to
temperatures lower than 400  C. This relatively rapid increase in
reﬂectance remains rapid up to 700  C. Above 700  C the rate of
increase of the reﬂectance decreases and then decreases still
further at temperatures above 900  C.
Reﬂectance measurements on charcoal fuel samples heated to
temperatures >800  C at the HHR showed similar results to those
obtained from the oak and birch material heated at the HHR to
equivalent ﬁnal temperatures.
Using the LHR regime no difference was observed between pine
samples subject to the two heating regimes and heated to equivalent ﬁnal temperatures (data not shown). This corresponds with
earlier observations on wheat grains subject to similar heating
conditions (Braadbaart, 2008).
The effect of time of exposure on reﬂectance of samples of
oak and pine can be seen in Fig. 6. Reﬂectance increases not only
as a function of temperature (which was to be expected) but also
as a function of time, with the shorter time of exposure to
a given temperature resulting in a lower reﬂectance. However, at
lower temperatures (370 and 440  C) the inﬂuence of time is
relatively less than at higher temperatures (500–800  C). At
temperatures above 900  C, the inﬂuence of time of exposure
again decreases.

experimentally heated, using the HHR, for 15, 60 and 1440 min, plotted as a function of
the ﬁnal temperature ( C). Reﬂectance is seen to increase as a function of time exposed
to a particular temperature as well as the temperature itself with the greatest increase
falling in the temperature range of 440–800  C. Symbols as in Fig. 5.

4.5. Chemical analysis
4.5.1. Elemental analysis
The elemental analysis of the untreated oak wood sample shows
a carbon content of 50.1 wt%, daf (Fig. 7). The carbon content of the
wood up to a temperature of 220  C remains relatively stable. As
oak wood is heated to temperatures above 220  C the carbon
content increases sharply rising from w51 wt%, daf at 220  C to

levelling off at temperatures >650  C. Note the slight (unexplainable) decrease in
carbon content at 160  C which was also found in peas and sunﬂower achenes and
seeds subjected to the same experimental protocol (Braadbaart, 2004, ﬁgure 2.5;

70.5 wt%, daf at 310  C and then steadily up to w94 wt%, daf at
650  C. At temperatures from 650 to 1200  C the carbon content
remains relatively constant.
4.5.2. Molecular analysis
Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are structural biopolymers of
wood. During thermal decomposition (DTMS-EI) each polymer
system generates its own chemical moieties with a characteristic
mass distribution and appearance temperature. Together the
presence of these different biopolymers results in a relatively
complex pyrolysate. Thermal decomposition of these biomolecules
as a function of the temperature has been discussed extensively in
earlier studies (Braadbaart, 2004; Poole et al., 2002; Braadbaart
et al., 2007) and thus thermal decomposition of wood will only be
summarized here. The chemical composition of untreated oak and
pine differ and therefore the results are presented separately.
4.5.2.1. Oak. The EI spectrum of the untreated sample has an ion
distribution that represents the characteristic mass peaks of polysaccharides and lignin (Fig. 8a). Mass peaks m/z 43, 57, 60, 73, 98,
126 and 144 are derived from hexosesugars (cellulose) and m/z 85
and 114 from pentosesugars (hemicelluloses) (Pouwels et al., 1989;
Boon et al., 1994; Braadbaart, 2004). The main lignin markers in this
spectrum are the monomeric guaiacyl units m/z 124, 137, 150, 151,
178, 180 and the syringyl units m/z 154, 167, 180, 194, 208, 210 (Van
der Hage et al., 1993). The major mass peaks are assigned to coniferyl alcohol (m/z 180) and sinapyl alcohol (m/z 210). In the higher
mass region, several lignin markers are visible. Mass peak m/z 272

is a well-known product of lignin pyrolysis with several plausible
structures (Evans et al., 1986).
The samples heated at 160 and 220  C have an identical mass
distribution to the sample of untreated oak. At 250  C masses m/z
110, 124, 138, 140, 154 and 168 (alkyldihydroxybenzenes or alkylmethoxyphenols or trimethoxybenzenes) become more apparent
and are indicative of the presence of masses related to the thermal degradation of lignin (Klap et al., 1996). A relative increase of
the aforementioned ions continues at 280, 290 and 300  C. At
310  C the intensity of the polysaccharide markers has decreased
substantially (Fig. 8b) and at 340  C these markers are no longer
apparent in the spectrum and only thermal degradation products
of lignin are observed (not shown).
At 340 and 370  C the spectra (not shown) present clusters of
three mass peaks with (CH2) mass increments such as m/z 146, 147,
148, 160, 161, 162, etc. that correspond to a homologues series of
condensed aromatic compounds and mass peaks related to alkylated phenols and benzenes such as m/z 91, 92, 94, 107, 108 and 122
with a relatively low intensity. These mass peaks are typical products resulting from the thermal degradation of polysaccharides and
lignin (Boon, 1992; Braadbaart et al., 2007). Finally, at temperatures
above 400  C, the material is characterized by a very low amount of
pyrolysis products. The spectra show ions m/z 28 (CO) and 44 (CO2)
derived from O-containing polyaromatics. Also m/z 78 (benzene) is
present indicative of a highly condensed material.
4.5.2.2. Pine. Untreated pine wood is characterized by the presence
of the above mentioned characteristic polysaccharide and lignin
markers, but only monomeric guaiacyl units (m/z 124, 137, 151, 178
and 180) are observed (Fig. 9a). In conifer wood m/z 272 is usually
higher in abundance when compared with angiosperm wood
(Evans et al., 1986). The higher mass range is characterized by
masses m/z 239, 285, 300 and 302, which are indicative of the
presence of pine resin (Colombini et al., 2005). Masses m/z 256 and
284 are attributed to fatty acids.
The mass distribution of the samples heated at 160, 220 and
250  C remain unchanged relative to the untreated sample. Above
250  C the presence of masses m/z 110, 124 and 138 (dihydroxybenzenes or alkylated methoxyphenols) indicate the presence of
thermally degraded lignin (Klap et al., 1996). At 310 (Fig. 9b) and
320  C the polysaccharide and lignin (guaiacyl) pyrolysis products
remain abundant (in contrast to oak), which is also true for mass
peaks m/z 91, 92, 94 and 107. The masses m/z 284, 298, 312 and 326,
with a relative high intensity can be attributed to fatty acids.
From 340  C the polysaccharide and lignin markers are no longer observed. The spectrum is characterized by the presence of
mass peaks m/z 110, 124 and 138, and m/z 91, 92, 94 and 107. As with
the oak material, at temperatures above 440  C, the pine wood is
characterized by a very low amount of pyrolysis products and ions
m/z 28 (CO) and 44 (CO2) and m/z 78 (benzene).

pieces of charcoal fuel from the charcoal kiln introduced to an
established ﬁre and left for 15 min at a temperature of 1100  C had
reﬂectance value of 5.95%Ro. The other two pieces, exposed to

the aim of this research was to determine how the processes associated with charcoaliﬁcation affect the morphological, physical

5.1. Mass loss, temperature and time of exposure
Although temperature is well known to be an inﬂuential factor
for wood conversion to charcoal, little consideration has been given
to the length of time of exposure to a heat source in relation to
charcoal formation. Mass loss is a direct means by which the effects
of time of exposure can be monitored. Samples heated to increasing
ﬁnal temperatures attain equal mass losses at decreasing times of
exposure (see horizontal dashed line depicting equal mass loss in
Fig. 2). The results found for the wood samples studied here are
similar to the ﬁndings of experiments performed on wheat grains
(Braadbaart, 2004) whereby mass loss in the wheat grains exhibited the same behaviour as the charcoal albeit at somewhat higher
temperatures and over a shorter time scale when compared with
lower temperatures (Fig. 2). These earlier studies on wheat grains
showed that the residues with equal mass loss also have identical
chemical structure and composition thus the amount of energy (in
this case heat) to convert the constituent biomolecules, cellulose,
hemicellulose and lignin, into new compounds is identical for
samples with equal mass loss. Therefore after a constant exposure

F. Braadbaart, I. Poole / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 2434–2445

time (60 min) morphological, chemical and physical changes in
charcoal at different ﬁnal temperatures were compared.
In addition to ﬁnal temperature and exposure time, heating rate
also contributed to when such changes occurred. This is important
as it might help determine whether the wood was used as a starter
fuel (LHR) or simply fed to an already established ﬁre (HHR). These
ﬁndings are similar to those of Braadbaart (2008) when wheat
grains were subject to the same experimental conditions. This rapid
mass loss is tentatively attributed to the violent reactions that take
place with a sudden injection of energy associated with the HHR
resulting in more material being lost to the external environment.
The morphologically denser structure of the conifer wood would
explain why an apparent increased amount of energy is required to
break down conifer wooddvolatile products released will be relatively more mass loss constrained when compared with the more
open structure of the angiosperm wood.
5.2. Morphological changes
An important aspect to archaeological charcoal studies is its
morphology (colour, anatomy and texture). Residues are generally
labelled ‘charcoal’ if they are dark brown-black with a relatively
light texture and can be fractured by hand. However, the degree of
change may provide further information regarding temperature
and thus ﬁre type and usage.
At temperatures of w350  C, regardless of heating regime, the
predominantly wood like residue becomes a predominantly charcoal like residue. This infers stability in chemical and physical
properties associated with a greater resistance to decomposition
after deposition into the soil. Therefore the archaeological record is
less likely to preserve evidence of wood heated at temperatures
below 350  C and a charcoal residue is indicative of ﬁres attaining
temperatures of w350  C and above.
At temperatures from 350 to w800  C a charcoal residue is
characteristically black in colour, can be easily fractured to reveal
a well preserved anatomical structure that can be easily seen under
epi-illumination. However at temperatures above 800  C, although
the outward appearance is that of charcoal, the residue has become
powdery in nature and the anatomy often distorted. At temperatures above 1000  C the anatomy is always distorted or deformed
often appearing as if it has become fused prior to solidiﬁcation. This
type of charcoal residue is often termed ‘poorly preserved’ when in
fact it is indicative of very high temperatures and thus possibly of
industrial, as opposed to domestic, ﬁres.
In this study 15% shrinkage had occurred at 350  C whereas at
800  C, 35% shrinkage had occurred. Little difference is seen between degree of shrinkage and heating regime although shrinkage
is initially (up to w800  C) greater with the HHR regime compared
with the LHR regime. Charcoal fuel also shrinks in similar fashion to
that of wood fuel. However, without knowledge of parameters
derived from the original wood, degree of shrinkage is of little use
to the archaeologist in determining temperature and thus ﬁre type.
5.3. Physical changes
It has been noted that under epi-illumination increasing
temperature results in an increased reﬂectance. This change in
reﬂectance is related to a change in molecular arrangement. Above
w280  C there is a gradual increase in the formation of multi-ring
(3–5) aromatic structural units which causes an increase in reﬂectance (Carr and Williamson, 1989; Braadbaart, 2004). At about
440  C condensation reactions take place accompanied by further
molecular reorganization and the formation of large polyaromatic
sheets which serve to increase reﬂectance still further (see below).
From around 800  C the change in molecular structure becomes
less drastic and this is reﬂected in the reﬂectance values increasing

2443

less steeply. This reﬂectance with increasing temperature can be
quantiﬁed using the reﬂectance of known standards. From this
purpose a calibration curve (Fig. 5) was established such that the
ﬁnal temperature to which charcoal residue was heated can be
obtained. Note that this curve was prepared using a time of
exposure of 60 min and different exposure times result in different
mass losses (Fig. 2). Thus (estimated) time of exposure has to be
taken into consideration when determining temperature from
reﬂectance.
Although heating regime (HHR versus LHR) produces no difference in reﬂectance values at a given temperature (and thus no
change in the shape of the plot; Fig. 5), time of exposure and taxonomic identity do. An increased time of exposure results in an
increased reﬂectance at any particular temperature (Fig. 6). This
difference is most obvious in the temperature range 500–800  C
when the gradient of the curve is at its steepest. When reﬂectance
values are <1%Ro, the difference in temperature attained after
15 min and 24 h of heating is in the order of 15  C. This is also the
case with reﬂectance values greater than 5.5%Ro. In the mid range,
between reﬂectance values of 1.5 and 5.5%Ro, the errors in temperature estimates can be as great as 75  C (%Ro ¼ 4).
Due to chemical and anatomical differences, taxonomic identity
affects the reﬂectance at a given temperature. Reﬂectance of pine
wood charcoal is consistently lower than that of oak wood charcoal.
These results were conﬁrmed by repeating the experiments with
birch and yew. Therefore in order to use reﬂectance values to
determine temperature from archaeological charcoal, knowledge of
the taxonomic identity and an informed estimate of time of
exposure based on contextual data are fundamental prerequisites.
5.4. Chemical changes
From elemental analysis of oak wood the increase in carbon
content with increasing temperature correlates to the change in
reﬂectance. Noteworthy is that at temperatures above w650  C the
carbon content levels off at about 95% daf (Fig. 7), which is at more
or less the same temperature at which the reﬂectance also levels off
(Fig. 5). Therefore carbon content of archaeological material in the
range of 55–90% daf can only be used by archaeologists to indirectly
determine temperature up to w650  C.
The change in molecular composition with temperature is more
complex since the taxonomic identity of the initial wood affects the
resultant composition. For both conifers and angiosperms, DTMS-EI
spectra of samples heated to 250  C are similar to untreated wood
with an essentially carbohydrate–lignin dominated structure with
both polysaccharide and lignin markers still present even though
dehydration reactions have changed the chemical composition.
This gradual change continues at temperatures >250  C where the
polysaccharide and lignin markers gradually disappear and are
replaced by thermal degradation products of these biomolecules.
Above 300  C (w310  C for oak wood and w340  C for pine wood)
polysaccharide and lignin markers are lost with angiosperm wood
producing more aromatic compounds relative to conifer wood at
any given temperature. At 400  C only aromatic moieties are
present in both conifers and angiosperms. At temperatures above
400  C the gradual change from the carbohydrate–lignin dominated structure to new, chemically distinct material with a highly
carbon enriched character characterized by DTMS spectra showing
masses representing CO, CO2 and benzene, has been completed.
Therefore temperature related changes cannot be determined from
samples heated to above w400  C. The slower chemical change in
conifer wood during the charcoaliﬁcation process co-occurs with
changes seen in the morphology and reﬂectance values as discussed above. Therefore it appears that more thermal energy is
needed to convert conifer wood into charcoal when compared with
oak wood. This observation is most probably related to the

2444

F. Braadbaart, I. Poole / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 2434–2445

morphological/anatomical composition of the conifer wood. The
denser structure of conifer wood could signiﬁcantly impact (i.e.
reduce) the release of volatile products, i.e. cannot be released or
undergo fast secondary condensation reactions. This would lead to
the apparent slower chemical changes. This might also explain the
observation by Fengel and Wegener (1984) that above 340  C,
heating pine wood produced more wood tar than oak wood, which
in turn contributed to a higher mass loss and less charcoal residue
for pine wood.
5.5. Application to charcoal recovered from archaeological
contexts and simulated situations
In light of the results obtained from these studies on experimentally produced charcoal, the techniques were ﬁrst applied to
archaeologically simulated material to calibrate the experimental
results, and then the analyses described here were applied to
charcoal from known archaeological contexts to evaluate feasibility.
Some methods (chemical analyses) were not applied as they do not
provide any additional insight to that already available from morphological and physical analyses. Since an indication of exposure
time and taxonomic identity is required for further charcoal residue
studies, identiﬁcations were carried out and exposure times estimated for the archaeological samples that were made available for
this study. Estimations of time of exposure can be gained from the
contextual data.
In general, residues from three different heating regimes are
frequently encountered in the archaeological record. Domestic
ﬁres, for heating and cooking, use wood as a fuel, which undergoes
charring in the presence of air. Much of the fuel succumbs to
complete combustion to form ash at temperatures that can reach
800  C. This ash is subsequently lost from the archaeological record.
However, charcoal residues from such a context will not be the fuel
that reached these high temperatures but rather the fuel that was
either added towards the end of the life of the ﬁre, or had been
removed from the ﬁre either directly by human intervention, or
indirectly by falling out of, or on to the edge of, the ﬁre. In these
situations temperatures falling to below 350  C coupled with no
further volatile-release result in an interruption of the carbonization process as the ﬁre becomes extinguished. Time of exposure
will be relatively short (>15 min but less than 30 min). Such pieces
of wood will usually record temperatures of 300–400  C. Higher
temperatures will be recorded if the exposure time is short (i.e. 10–
15 min).
Charcoal fuel and tar production exploits the process of charring
where air (oxygen) is excluded from the heating process to ensure
a good quality product with a high caloriﬁc value. Clay, turf or other
similar material would have covered the kiln or pit to ensure anoxic
conditions and thus prevent combustion, which would inevitably
occur if oxygen comes into contact with wood heated to between
450 and 500  C. The time of exposure for charcoal formation in this
way would be relatively long, at least 24 h (Armstrong, 1978).
Industrial ﬁres, in contrast to their domestic counterparts, require temperatures in excess of 600  C. For ﬁring pottery, wood
can be used as the fuel to reach the required temperature of
600–900  C (Livingstone, 2001). For ﬁres requiring temperatures
w800  C and above, the higher caloriﬁc value of charcoal as a fuel
had to be exploited. Such ﬁres, with temperatures reaching
1300  C, would have been used for smelting ore or melting metals,
for example. Air is introduced to the ﬁre to ensure high temperatures are reached and maintained, and again charring takes place.
As with a domestic ﬁre, the charcoal residue will be derived from
fuel added towards the end of the life of the ﬁre or pieces that had
been removed from the ﬁre. The exposure time of this charcoal
residue will also have been short but will record much higher
temperatures.

The details of charcoal produced in simulated archaeological
setting have been given in Table 2A and those of archaeological
charcoal from known contextual settings in Table 2B. Using
morphological changes of archaeologically simulated material of
known taxonomic identity at heated to known temperatures for
given lengths of time (Table 1), derived ﬁnal temperature values
can be inferred by the %Ro values from the calibration curve given in
Figs. 5 and 6. When these estimated temperatures are compared
with the known ﬁnal temperatures, the derived temperatures were
in general agreement with the actual temperatures at which they
were produced in all cases.
Even though some derived temperatures deviated from the
actual temperatures they were in good agreement with the range of
temperature found in a particular ﬁre type (i.e. domestic versus
industrial). When the ﬁnal temperatures of the archaeological
samples are determined using %Ro values (Table 2B) and the curves
in Figs. 5 and 6, there is once again good agreement between the
estimated temperature and the contextual information. One example illustrating the importance of taxonomic identity is the reﬂectance measured on charcoal samples from four beams, situated
in close proximity to one another (<5 m), recovered from Herculaneum (Italy) (unpublished data). Reﬂectance measurements from
the three angiosperm beams were higher than that measured on
the one conifer beam. From the calibration curve (Fig. 5) the conclusions regarding exposure temperature drawn from the conifer
wood would have been w100  C lower that those estimated for the
angiosperm material had taxonomic identity not been taken into
consideration.
6. Conclusions
Based on the results of this study it is concluded that:
 Archaeological charcoal can be deﬁned as an inert, black material heated to temperatures exceeding 350  C for at least
15 min either by (1) carbonization in the absence of air (oxygen), or (2) incomplete (interrupted) charring in the presence
of a restricted supply of air (oxygen).
 Charcoal residue formation is related to not only temperature
but also length of exposure to the heat source and the associated heating rate.
 Morphological analyses of archaeological charcoal can provide
additional information relating to ﬁnal temperature and in turn
further understanding of the type of ﬁre in which it was formed
(i.e. industrial or domestic), and by inference human activities
at that site.
 Physical analyses (reﬂectance) can also provide additional information relating to ﬁnal temperature and by inference human activities at that site. A recommended minimum size of
w3 mm2 in transverse section of the charcoal specimen should
used, which would allow identiﬁcation of anatomical preservation as well as taxonomic identity (conifer or angiosperm).
 Chemical (molecular, DTMS-EI, and elemental, i.e. carbon)
analyses were undertaken to determine whether additional
information, to that which could be derived from morphological and physical analyses, could be obtained. No additional
information could be obtained for archaeological charcoal
samples heated to temperatures in excess of w400  C for
DTMS-EI and 650  C for elemental analysis. Below these
temperatures (and especially below 300  C) the time of exposure plays an important role in interpreting the data. For archaeological samples, time of exposure is not known and thus
prevents the use such data to draw any meaningful
conclusions.
 Differences in the morphology of wood appear to impact the
physical and chemical changes. The denser conifer wood

F. Braadbaart, I. Poole / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 2434–2445

requires relatively greater energy input in order to undergo
similar chemical and physical alteration when compared with
angiosperm wood. This is due to mass loss constraints.
 Conclusions derived from morphological and physical analyses
have to be used together with the archaeological contextual
data wherever possible.
