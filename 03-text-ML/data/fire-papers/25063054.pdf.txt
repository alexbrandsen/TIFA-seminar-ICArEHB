EARLY MAYA ADAPTIVE PATTERNS: MID-LATE HOLOCENE
PALEOENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE FROM PACIFIC GUATEMALA
Hector Neff, Deborah M. Pearsall, John G. Jones, B?rbara Arroyo,

Shawn K. Collins, and Dorothy E. Freidel

We summarize what is known about Archaic period occupation of southeastern Mesoamerica and Central America as back
ground for presenting new paleoenvironmental evidence ofpre-Early Formative human impacts on the landscape of Pacific

coastal Guatemala. Our evidence comes from sediment cores in three locations, all of which are in the mangrove-estuary
zone of the lower coast. Pollen and phytoliths from the cores document increased burning, decreased forest cover, the appear

ance of domesticates, and increased disturbance indicators at various times during the Archaic period, the earliest being
around 3500 cal B.C. The available evidence demonstrates that shifting horticulture was an early and widespread adapta
tion to the southeastern Mesoamerican deciduous tropical forest and constituted the base from which later adaptations,
including that of early May a farmers, differentiated. Early Formative adaptive innovations may have been favored by shifts

in return rates from various estuarine and terrestrial resources during a dry and variable interval 2000 and 1500 cal B.C.

A continuaci?n se resume la informaci?n conocida de la ocupaci?n del per?odo Arcaico en el sureste de Mesoam?rica y Cen

paleoenvironmental record of Pacific Guatemala in
order to obtain information about the early human
occupants of this region.

Pacific Guatemala is part of a lowland corridor

that stretches from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec
south across Chiapas and Guatemala to western El
Salvador. The network of canals and lagoons within
the estuary system facilitates east-west movement
(Lowe et al. 1982; Navarette 1978). Ease of travel
and communication through this corridor may help

Because there are few lakes on the coastal plain
of Guatemala, our sampling program focused on
the estuarine zone, where we consistently found

Discussion
Archaic Period Horticulture
The claim that seasonal lowland forests of the New
World tropics were the settings for early horticul
ture and plant domestication has substantial empir
ical support, some of which is summarized in an

earlier section of this paper (see also Piperno and
Pearsall 1998). The evidence conforms to theoret
ical expectations, which suggest that energetic
advantages of cultivation (of both domesticates and

non-domesticates) in a seasonal tropical forest
would have selected for its adoption as forests
expanded in the New World tropics during the early

Holocene (Piperno 2006; Piperno and Pearsall
1998). That is, seasonal tropical forests that have
not been impacted by humans are relatively impov
erished in high-return resources (e.g., large herd
mammals, dense stands of grain plants), so that
even a small investment in modifying the natural
habitat by clearing and planting yields improved
return rates, which would have favored perpetua
tion and elaboration of such practices.
Consistent with theory and evidence from else
where in the New World tropics, the earliest signal
of humans in the seasonal tropical forest of Pacific
Guatemala indicates a horticultural land-use sys

of human populations with land-use practices that

included clearing, burning, and at least some cul
tivation of domesticates or proto-domesticates.

Archaic period horticulture was an improve
ment over hunting and gathering in terms of energy

returns in the seasonal tropical forest environment

(and indeed may have permitted initial human
occupation of many such environments, including

Pacific Guatemala), but the initial responses of
plants to human cultivation did not create a sub
sistence system that could support large human
populations. One can speculate that, if they were
archaeologically visible, Archaic period archaeo
logical sites would be analogous to early horticul
tural settlements in Panama, Ecuador, Colombia,
and northern Peru, which consisted of small ham
lets of at most a few nuclear families (Piperno and
Pearsall 1998). An analysis by Kennett et al. (2006)
identifies the resource characteristics that would

have favored low human population growth rates:
relatively high production costs of a cultivar such
as primitive maize coupled with relatively low har
vest efficiency would favor only gradual increases
in the abundance of the cultivar, which in turn
would limit the growth rate of the population of cul

tivators.

As predicted by Piperno and Pearsall (1998;
Piperno 2006), horticultural adaptation emerged
early in the deciduous tropical forest of Pacific
Guatemala. In fact, modification of the tropical for

est landscape for horticulture is the earliest
detectable signal of human presence in Pacific
Guatemala. In neighboring Chiapas there is an early

shellfish-collecting component of the subsistence
system, but we expect sediment records currently
under study to show early horticultural activities
there as well. Although domesticates were avail
able, none responded to cultivation with produc
tivity increases that could underwrite population
growth and sedentism. This non-intensive tropical
forest horticultural adaptation became widespread
in eastern Mesoamerica and Central America and

was the background from which more specialized
adaptations, including the early Maya, differenti
ated after the third millennium cal B.C.
Our specific suggestions about the process by
which a relatively sedentary, pottery-using Early
Formative adaptive pattern evolved out of Archaic
antecedents will certainly be refined or rejected by
future research. The association of Early Forma
tive innovations with a dry climate seems relatively

clear at the moment, but paleoenvironmental work
now in progress in southern Chiapas will provide
a further test of this association. Future discovery
and investigation of Late Archaic archaeological
contexts, especially contexts representing the ter
restrial component of subsistence, would clearly

provide a major new line of evidence bearing on

phytolith analysis. Thanks also to Dolores Piperno for com

were reported, to Barbara Voorhies and Doug Kennett for

numerous discussions related to our common interest in the

Francisco Estrada Belli for comments on an earlier draft of
the paper, and to two anonymous reviewers for their helpful

comments. We also thank Jos? Luis Lanata and Mark
Aldenderfer for the professional way in which our manu

of these individuals deserves any blame for remaining errors,
