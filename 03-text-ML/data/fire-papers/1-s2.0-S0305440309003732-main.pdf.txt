When the ﬁrst Polynesian settlers arrived on Rapa Nui, about 70% of the island was covered with dense
woodland in which Jubaea palms dominated. Our investigations of extended soil proﬁles provide
evidence that more than 16 million palm trees grew on the island. Nearly all palms were removed by the
16th century. Teeth marks on nutshells of the Jubaea palms from the 13th or 14th centuries attest to the
activity of Paciﬁc rats (Rattus exulans) on Rapa Nui, which were probably imported there by the ﬁrst
Polynesians settlers. Did the rats perhaps prevent the germination of palm seeds and thus the regeneration of the dense palm woodland of Rapa Nui?
The results of our investigations refute this hypothesis and support the assumption that people cut the
trees. Burned relicts of palm stumps and widespread burned soil layers containing charred endocarps of
the palms testify to intensive slash and burn activities between 1250 AD and 1500 AD. However, in one
area on Rapa Nui, evidence for regeneration of palm woodland following the ﬁrst clearing was found.
This ﬁnding provides evidence against a major rat impact. Furthermore, the Jubaea chilensis woodland in
central Chile illustrates that small rodents and Jubaea palms can coexist. We conclude that people, not
rats, were the dominant destroyers of the palm woodland on Rapa Nui.

1. Rapa Nui and the destruction of its woodland

less landscape. The analysis of pollen, phytoliths, and macro-relicts
delivered scientiﬁc evidence: thousands of years before people

Rapa Nui (Easter Island) is the most eastern island of Polynesia,
located at a distance of about 3700 km from South America. There
was a general agreement amongst Rapa Nui scholars that the island
was colonized by Polynesians no later than the end of the ﬁrst
millennium AD (e.g. Martinsson-Wallin, 2004; Vargas et al., 2006).
This is currently doubted by Hunt and Lipo (2006), who assume
a signiﬁcantly later primary arrival of people around 1200 AD.
However, despite (or because of) its isolation, the island underwent
a dramatic ecological change between the date of Polynesian colonization and the ‘‘discovery’’ of the island by Europeans on April 5,
1722. The circumstances, causes, and triggers of these environmental changes are the subject of persistent scientiﬁc discussion.
Today, the surface of Rapa Nui’s landscape is dominated by
grassland and millions of stones. It has a dry appearance, interspersed with only occasional groves of Eucalyptus globosus and
other exotic tree species. European seafarers in the 18th century
(Forster, 1983 [1784]; Mureau, 1799) described Rapa Nui as a tree-

arrived at Rapa Nui, the island was covered with a highly diverse
woodland (Fig. 1). The degradation began around 1000 AD and
reached its height in the 17th century (Flenley, 1993; Orliac, 2000,
2003). Most indigenous and endemic plant species became extinct.
One of these was a palm species, which once dominated the
woodland and perhaps was endemic to Rapa Nui. Dransﬁeld (in
Zizka, 1991, pp. 65–66), classiﬁed the extinct palm Rapa Nui palm as
a new genus/species (Paschalococos disperta). This classiﬁcation was
based on investigations by Dransﬁeld et al. (1984) who described
slight differences between the endocarp structure of the Rapa Nui
palm and endocarps of Jubaea chilensis, a palm endemic to central
Chile. However, the strong similarity between conserved seeds and
phytoliths of the Rapa Nui palm and the related structures of Jubaea
chilensis suggests that it was congeneric with J. chilensis, if not the
same species (Delhon and Orliac, in press; Grau, 2005).
Jubaea chilensis is among the largest and longest living palm
species on earth. Full-grown individuals easily become 15 m high
and can occasionally grow up to 30 m. The life span of Jubaea chilensis is more than 300 years. The oldest trees in Chile have
estimated ages of 750–1000 years (Grau, 2004, p. 87, p. 101; Hoffmann, 1998). The trees produce large amounts of seed in the form of
miniature ‘‘coconuts’’, ranging between 2 and 3 cm in diameter. It is
highly plausible that the buoyant palm nuts invaded Rapa Nui as
a result of ocean transport from the Chilean coast (Grau, 2004).
Perhaps the palm on Rapa Nui underwent evolutionary speciation
due to its isolation. New comparative analyses of the palm phytoliths
now suggest more than one Jubaea-like species on Rapa Nui (Delhon
and Orliac, in press). Here we term the Rapa Nui palm Jubaea sp., not
deﬁning the (one or more) species due to the current uncertainties.
2. Controversial discussion about the causes
of Rapa Nui’s deforestation
Who or what destroyed the ancient palm woodland on Rapa
Nui? Several scholars assume that the prehistoric population of
Rapa Nui was responsible for the deforestation. They argue that the
Polynesian population grew quickly, that the people demanded
open space for a growing number of dwellings and gardens, and
that they demanded more and more ﬁrewood and timber (Diamond, 2005; Flenley and Bahn, 2003; Mann et al., 2003; Prebble
and Dowe, 2008; Stevenson and Haoa, 1999; Van Tilburg, 1994).
Trees are also thought to have been important for Rapa Nui’s unique
megalithic culture. Logs were possibly used for the transportation
and erection of the giant stone statues (moai) and for the building
of large stone platforms (ahu). There is consensus amongst most
scholars that the Rapanui themselves had completed the deforestation of their island before the ﬁrst Europeans arrived (Flenley,
1993; Flenley and Bahn, 2003; Flenley and King, 1984; Mieth and
Bork, 2004; Rolett and Diamond, 2004).
The impact of climatic variations is also under debate. In sediment cores of Lake Rano Raraku, Mann et al. (2008, p. 24) found
indications for a drought period ‘‘some time’’ between 3390 and
1180 cal yr BP. Despite this ﬁnding, the authors found in the sediment stratigraphy strong indications for signiﬁcant human impact
on the woodland in the form of rapidly increasing amounts of
charcoal, an increase in mineral contents, and a decrease in palm
pollen numbers, all beginning with the time of colonization.
Nevertheless, the authors still do not rule out that an extreme
weather period might have contributed to the woodland destruction. On the other hand, long-term pollen data from other investigations refute this idea. By way of sediment cores from the lake at
Rano Raraku, Flenley and King (1984) documented the continuous
presence of palm trees up to 35,000 years back in time, despite all
climatic variations that happened or might have happened from
the late Pleistocene until the late Holocene. This is supported by

Prebble and Dowe (2008, p. 2563) in their review paper on palm
extinctions on numerous Paciﬁc islands who see no indications for
a palm extinction on Rapa Nui ‘‘following abrupt regional climate
change events recorded from a range of proxies elsewhere in the
Paciﬁc’’. Moreover, simulation experiments and climate modeling
demonstrate that during prehistoric times neither El Niño events
nor the ‘‘Little Ice Age’’ had signiﬁcant effects on Rapa Nui’s climate
(Genz and Hunt, 2003; Junk, 2009; MacIntyre, 2001).
3. Rats or humans?
The discussion on the causes of Rapa Nui’s deforestation was
invigorated recently by the question of whether Paciﬁc rats (Rattus
exulans), not humans, might have destroyed the palm vegetation
(Diamond, 2007; Flenley and Bahn, 2007; Hunt and Lipo, 2007).
The Paciﬁc rat is the third most widely dispersed rat species on
earth. This species was once a frequent companion on the sailing
boats of the seafaring people in Oceania and colonized the islands of
Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia together with the humans over
time (Matisoo-Smith and Robins, 2004; Matisoo-Smith et al., 1998).
More often than not, the seafarers deliberately transported the Paciﬁc
rats and set them ashore on the newly discovered islands since the
rats represented a valuable source of protein, as did the domestic
animals (especially chickens and pigs) that were also on the ships
(Matisoo-Smith and Robins, 2004). During archaeological excavations, rat bones were commonly found in direct proximity of settlements, often in cooking pits (umu) and rubbish pits (Barnes et al.,
2006; Martinsson-Wallin and Crockford, 2001; Mieth and Bork, 2004,
pp. 80–81; Skjølsvold, 1994; Steadman et al., 1994). The fact of this
speciﬁc coexistence between humans and rats on the one hand, and
the modern DNA-analysis technology of rat bone relics on the other
hand, enabled a detailed reconstruction of the spatiotemporal colonization in the southern Paciﬁc (Matisoo-Smith and Robins, 2004).
However, it has not yet been determined when the ﬁrst Paciﬁc
rats reached Rapa Nui and if they arrived with the ﬁrst colonizers or
possibly in the course of later arrivals of people. Last but not least,
these questions are linked to recent debates about the chronology of
human settlement on Rapa Nui, which are not the focal point here.
As mentioned earlier, based on radiocarbon data taken from the
oldest occupation layer found at Anakena, and by the rejection of
several older radiocarbon dates taken by other authors, Hunt and
Lipo (2006) assume that Rapa Nui was not occupied before
1200 AD. However, our own ﬁndings concerning the development
of land use mentioned below (relics of extensive horticulture in the
palm woodland before 1200 AD, widespread and extreme laborintensive woodland clearance as early as 1250 AD) are strong
arguments in favor of colonization considerably before 1100 AD.
Rat bones that were found in the oldest occupation layers at
Anakena have been dated to the following time frames: between
600 AD and 1260 AD (2s calibrated dates) according to MartinssonWallin and Crockford (2001, p. 246), between 800 AD and 1000 AD
according to Skjølsvold (1994, p. 110), and between 1055 AD and
1400 AD (2s calibrated dates) according to Hunt and Lipo (2006, p.
1603). However, these dates have a limited spatiotemporal significance because it is not possible to deduce from these data that
Anakena is the location of the ﬁrst settlement on the island or that
the ﬁrst rats went ashore there. Furthermore, it is not yet possible,
neither on the base of radiocarbon dates nor with help of genetic
analysis of rat bones found on Rapa Nui, to tell if the Paciﬁc rats
actually arrived with the ﬁrst colonizers or if they arrived at Rapa
Nui with later arriving seafarers (Barnes et al. 2006, p. 1539).
Hunt (2006, 2007) does not only argue for a later settlement of
Rapa Nui than is generally assumed by most scholars. He also sets
up the hypothesis that the rat, which was imported by Polynesians,
multiplied explosively on the island and destroyed the natural

A. Mieth, H.-R. Bork / Journal of Archaeological Science 37 (2010) 417–426

woodland on Rapa Nui within a few centuries by consuming the
palm seeds and/or other parts of the trees. He deduces his
hypothesis from investigations by Athens et al. (2002) who reason
a destructive behavior of Rattus exulans by palaeo-ecological
investigations in the woodland on Hawaii.
Mann et al. (2008, p. 24) conducted investigations of sediment
archives in the crater lake of volcano Rano Raraku which contradict
this hypothesis. On the basis of pollen data they found no evidence
for a signiﬁcant impact of rats proceeding anthropogenic woodland
destruction.
Brown (2006 [1924]) reported that rats were even valued as
a currency by the Polynesian inhabitants in the past. This report
indicates that rats were once not abundant, but rare on the island,
and that people looked upon the animals as valuable (a food
source) and not as a major environmental problem.
The following results of our investigations, based on the intensive
analysis of soils and sediments at several sites, also disagree with the
hypothesis of a major rat impact, and clearly support an anthropogenic interpretation for the demise of Rapa Nui’s woodland.
4. Investigation strategy
We investigated the landscape development during the younger
Holocene using landscape system analysis, which included the
identiﬁcation of natural and man-made structures and processes in
excavated soils and sediments, detailed lab analysis of the physical,
chemical and biological characteristics of soils and sediments, and
radiocarbon dating of organic relicts. This approach results in
a detailed spatial and temporal reconstruction of the landscape
development of Rapa Nui, in which natural and anthropogenic
effects can be separated. An important part of this methodology is
the detailed investigation of anthropogenic remnants as well as
soils and sediments in large exposures. On Rapa Nui, numerous
exposures were opportunistically made available for study by soil
erosion and, in one case (Maunga Orito, Fig. 2), by soil mining. The
large extent of these proﬁles (cf. Fig. 2) enabled a reconstruction of
the landscape development at several parts of the island.
5. Results
5.1. Remnants of the palm woodland
In many of the yellowish, brownish or reddish, loamy or clayey
remnants of the primeval soils of Rapa Nui, we found traces of the
ancient palm vegetation in the form of tube-like molds of palm roots

The photograph shows an extended exposure at Maunga Orito. The dark Holocene soil
contains many root casts of the now extinct Rapa Nui palm.

(Fig. 3). These root tubes are 5–7 mm in diameter. Mann et al. (2003)
also investigated the primeval soils with the palm root tubes on
Poike peninsula. They mention that the root tubes occupy up to 40–
50% of soil volume (Mann et al., 2003, p. 140). The root bundles of
individual palms form cone-like patterns near the former soil
surface and cylindrical patterns below (Fig. 5A (2) and Fig. 5B (2)).
They are characteristically unbranched. In our investigations at
Poike peninsula and in the surroundings of Rano Kau (for locations
see Fig. 7) we often found root molds protruding more than 10 m
into the weathered volcanic bedrock. The root casts can be easily
seen in most exposures. The tubes are very solid due to hardening of
the soil around them. At a few sites, remains of charred roots were
found in the tubes, some of which have been dated (e.g. KIA, 18835,
Table 1). Also, Mann et al. (2003, p. 140) mention that the root tubes
contain traces of charred material. The well-preserved systems of
root casts must represent the last generation of palms that grew on
Rapa Nui since the overlap of root molds by more than one palm
generation would have formed a mixture of root structures in the
soils. Thus, something special in the life history of the last palm
generation in each site must have caused the root printings. Root
casts of two palm generations were found at one site only (at the
inner slope in the western part of Rano Raraku, Figs. 7 and 14), which
are represented in two layers, one above the other (see below).
The palm root casts have been described by some authors (Bahn
and Flenley, 1992; Mann et al., 2003; Mieth et al., 2002). Mieth and

used for cooking.

Bork (2003) made the ﬁrst systematic reconstruction of the spatial
and temporal distribution of the last generation of palm woodland
on the island. The cone-like root patterns of single palms (Figs. 4, 5
and 6) permitted the differentiation of individual palms, the
determination of the spacing between palm trees, and the diameters of their root crowns. In this way, the authors reconstructed the
stand structure of the prehistoric palm woodland, e.g. for a 100 m
long soil proﬁle in the south west of Poike peninsula (Mieth and
Bork 2003, p. 73).
The reconstruction demonstrates that the palm woodland was
very dense and that young palms grew between older and larger
palms. Soil proﬁles with a cumulative length of more than
6,000 m scattered over the island show that about 70% of the
island’s surface was once covered by palm woodland. Only a few
palm remains were found more than 250 m above sea level at
Maunga Terevaka (Fig. 7). Mann et al. (2003) described the
absence of palm root casts 300 m a.s.l. at the same volcano. Based
on an average growing distance of 2.6 m between the trees and
the documentation of more than 100 investigation sites referenced to an area of 117 km2, we calculated that approximately 16

million palm trees once grew on the island (Mieth and Bork,
2006). Thus, the palm trees dominated the ancient vegetation
structure, both in terms of their large size (stem diameters up to
1.5 m) and their high density.
Certainly there were other trees and shrubs in the woodland.
However, these left no root casts in the soil. Pollen ﬁndings and
charcoal wood species identiﬁcation prove the existence of a large

number of other species making up a mesophytic woodland
vegetation (Flenley, 1993; Orliac, 2000, 2003; Orliac and Orliac,
2005).
Nevertheless, despite the diversity that once characterized the
woodland of Rapa Nui, the Jubaea palm must have been a key
species for the prehistoric human population. The palms must have
been an enormous biotic resource for the early islanders,

considering the implied abundance of stem wood, palm nuts, palm
sap and palm leaves (Bork and Mieth, 2003; Grau, 1998; Orliac,
2003). Perhaps the Jubaea palm had the same value for the Rapanui
as the coconut palm had for the inhabitants of other islands in
Polynesia. Although coconut palms were imported and cultivated
on many Paciﬁc islands, they do not grow well on Rapa Nui because
of its harsher climate.
The oldest cultural layers we found are garden soils that were
integrated into the palm woodland. These garden soils are
preserved between the undisturbed casts of the palm roots and
underneath later cultural horizons (Fig. 5A (3) and Fig. 5B (3);
Mieth and Bork, 2004, pp. 52–53 and p. 65, Fig. 35A). Thus, early
crop cultivation was obviously an integrated part of the palm
woodland with the advantage that the palms protected the
gardens from drying, from harsh winds, runoff, and soil erosion
by water and wind. Charcoal is very rare in the oldest cultural
layers. Further investigations are needed to achieve more chronological details.
5.2. Evidence for slash and burn
Soil proﬁles in many areas of Rapa Nui provide evidence of ﬁres
in the former palm woodland. Over large areas, a single layer of

charcoal and ashes several millimeters in thickness can be found
deep below the recent surface and on top of the prehistoric garden
soils that belong to the period of woodland gardening (Fig. 5B).
Occasionally we found several thin layers of charcoal on the lower
and concave parts of some slopes. The explanation for this ﬁnding:
the runoff of several intensive precipitation events evidently
washed the charcoal downhill. The stratigraphic position of these
charcoal layers above the level of the uppermost palm root casts is
signiﬁcant (Fig. 5B; Mieth et al., 2002, p. 91). The charcoal layers
often contain burned nutshells of Jubaea palms and, in some areas,
cover tens of thousands of square meters. For example, we found
these extended burned layers on Poike Peninsula and in the south
west of Rapa Nui. The extensive distribution of charcoal layers can
only have one explanation: widespread ﬁres in the woodland of
Rapa Nui. Apart from an older age of a charred palm root (KIA
18835, Table 1), the oldest date of charcoal we obtained is from
a burned nutshell from a soil proﬁle in the east of the Poike
Peninsula with a 2-sigma cal age of AD 1244–1254 and cal AD
1256–1299 (KIA 17107, Table 1). Thus, we interpret the 13th century
to be the beginning of intensive slash and burn on Rapa Nui.
Numerous remains of burned palm stumps in the soils at several
locations on the island (Fig. 6) support the hypothesis that the
burning was caused by humans, not by natural events. Many palms

A. Mieth, H.-R. Bork / Journal of Archaeological Science 37 (2010) 417–426

were cut efﬁciently a few centimeters above the soil surface. This is
evident by clean cut, truncated surfaces of burned palm stumps
which we found in situ at many sites on the island. Other parts of
the palms (e.g. their leaves), and probably also parts of other trees
and shrubs, were left on the surface and burned in large ﬁres. We
found charred plant remains of different macroscopic structures in
the extensive burn layers around the palm stumps. The extraction
of the very strong palm stumps was hard work for the people who
cleared the land. Instead of pulling the stumps, they seem to have
piled up dry plant material on top of them to increase their ﬂammability. On some stumps we found carbonized stalks of grass
which were used as fuel (Mieth and Bork, 2003, p. 74; KIA 19369,
Table 1).
Another line of evidence supports that humans caused the
burning. Some of the burned stumps show that they had been used
as ovens for cooking. The charcoal layers in these stumps are
disturbed by hollows caused by the placement and withdrawal of
food that was obviously put into the glowing stumps (Fig. 6). Some
hollows are ﬁlled with food remains, such as bone fragments,
mixed with soil aggregates and charcoal pieces.
The clear differentiation of the root casts representing individual palm trees in the soils as well as charred remains of palm
roots within the root tubes (KIA 18835, Table 1) suggest that large
ﬁres were responsible for the preservation and stabilization of the
palm root casts. Perhaps a combination of pedo-chemical and
pedo-physical processes with the direct heat impact on the soil plus
physiological reactions of the roots to the burning led to the
hardening, and thus to the stabilization, of the soil aggregates
around the roots. By observation of recent forest ﬁres, we noted
that tree roots may burn over long distances and deep into the soil.
Fig. 7 summarizes the radiocarbon dating of the woodland
clearance for 11 locations. Details of radiocarbon data are given in
Fig. 8 and Table 1.
Clearance occurred in phases of deforestation on Poike peninsula between approximately 1250 and 1510 AD, and at the slopes of
Rano Kao roughly between 1400 and 1520 AD. All data demonstrate
that the destruction of the palm woodland on Rapa Nui probably
lasted no longer than 300–400 years. This is supported by investigations of Mann et al. (2003, 2008) who sampled charcoal from the
land clearing at the downhill slopes of Poike peninsula, on the
slopes of Rano Kau, and at the volcano Maunga Terevaka. These
authors leave no doubt that the abundance of charcoal above the
primeval soils are the remains of widespread slash and burn (Mann
et al., 2003, pp. 148–150; Mann et al., 2008, pp. 20, 24). Their
radiocarbon data are consistent with our data, and testify that the
main slash and burn activity occurred between 1200 AD and
1600 AD.
Whereas charred wood includes the problem of possible predating of burning events, this is not the case for radiocarbon dates
of charred palm endocarps which are short-lived parts of the palms.
The ages of charred palm nuts, investigated by Delhon and Orliac
(in press), Mann et al. (2008), Mieth and Bork (2003) and Orliac
(2003) fall almost completely into the time frame between 1200 AD
and 1450 AD. Dating inconsistencies between these investigations
currently do not exist.
Both the temporal placement (after the onset of human colonization) and the sequential chronology of woodland clearance in
different parts of the island underscore the conclusion that the
deforestation was an act of humans. This is also underlined by the
fact that man-made stone structures like ahu were established
directly on top of the burned surfaces at many sites (Cauwe et al.,
2006, pp. 99 ff; Mieth and Bork, 2003). At some locations we found
evidence for horticulture established soon after burning/clearance
(Fig. 5A (6); Mieth and Bork, 2003, Fig. 7; Mieth et al., 2002, Fig. 7;
Stevenson et al., 2006).

5.3. Interactions between rats and palms
One indication for rats’ inﬂuence on the palms might be rat
teeth marks preserved in their seed shells (Mieth and Bork, 2004,
p. 55). Dransﬁeld et al. (1984, p. 750) and Hunt (2006, p. 217; 2007,
p. 496) investigated endocarps of the extinct palm species and
mention that all of the palm nuts have such gnaw marks.
However, they inspected palm nut individuals that, with no
exception, had been exposed and protected in caves for a long
time. Therefore rats had a high chance to ﬁnd and to eat them.
Thus, it is not surprising that all nuts hidden in caves show bite
marks. We mainly investigated charred endocarps (Fig. 9) that we
found in situ, i.e. in the charcoal layers, and that had had a much
shorter ‘‘life’’ span. Among more than 200 completely preserved
and charred nutshells that we discovered in the burned layers,
namely on Poike peninsula, less than 10% had the teeth marks of
rats. This ﬁnding is supported by Vogt (2009, p. 16) who recovered
numerous palm nuts that were un-charred and had been
conserved exceptionally well under clayey sediments. Only a few
had traces of gnawing.
For a comparative evaluation of the potential impact of rats on
Jubaea-like palms, we searched for the impacts of rodents in the
only place on earth where there is a large number of naturally
occurring Jubaea chilensis palms. This is La Campana National
Park in central Chile were there are about 80,000 palms (Grau,
2004, p. 49).
The Jubaea palms at La Campana are undergoing natural
regeneration and include a wide range of different sizes and ages,
including large numbers of young palms (Fig. 10). The palms have
no obvious difﬁculty in reproducing and growing, and palm seeds
clearly germinate (Fig. 11). The ground in this palm woodland is
littered with thousands of palm nutshells (Fig. 12). We found many
of these nutshells opened by small rodents with the pulp removed.
These nutshells have gnawing marks at the edges of the nut
openings – the same kind of teeth marks occurring on a few
nutshells on Rapa Nui (Figs. 13 and 14). Grau (1996) mentions two
species of mountain rats that inhabit La Campana: Abrocoma benetti
murrayi and Otodon degus. He reports that both species pierce the

Rapa Nui. Most nutshells are completely preserved in the burn layers. They break easily
during extraction due to their high fragility. Most charred palm nuts from Rapa Nui
have no rat teeth marks.

In spite of this signiﬁcant rodent predation which is obviously
much more extensive at La Campana than ever was the case on
Rapa Nui (illustrated there by a high percentage of ungnawed nuts),
the Jubaea palms at La Campana are able to regenerate, grow and
form a dense palm woodland.

5.4. An example of palm regeneration on Rapa Nui
The ﬁndings from La Campana prompt the following question:
could the Jubaea palm woodland on Rapa Nui have been more
sensitive to the presence of small rodents than the Jubaea palm
woodland in central Chile, which has been exposed to rodents for
thousands of years? To answer this question, we searched for
evidence that would show whether palms on Rapa Nui were able to
regenerate despite the presence of rats. We found proof of such
palm regeneration in one area located on the inner slope of the
Rano Raraku crater, northwest of the moai quarries. Exposures left
by recent erosion enabled us to investigate and reconstruct landscape development in this area (Fig. 15). Embedded in a colluvial
layer above the autochthonous soil, we found charcoal dating to the
ﬁrst deforestation at this site. This charcoal was dated to the late
13th and 14th centuries (2-sigma cal AD 1283–1328 and cal AD
1344–1394, KIA 17569, Table 1).
The overlying colluvial layer represents soil erosion and deposition
after the ﬁrst clearance of the palm woodland. Charred wood resulting
from initial woodland clearance was mixed into the colluvium by the
processes of erosion, transport, and sedimentation. Surprisingly, we
found traces of a second, younger generation of palms within this
colluvial layer in the form of palm root casts, as already described.
Clearly, palms were able to regenerate after the primeval woodland
was cleared from this site even though the woodland canopy had been
opened, erosion had taken place, and rats were present on the island.
Apparently, new palms regenerated for a while. These palms too were
then cleared, again leaving charcoal behind, as in the remains of
a burned palm stump, which we dated to the ﬁrst half of the 15th
century (2-sigma cal AD 1402–1436, KIA 17119, Table 1). Sediments
then buried this younger level of palm root casts.
6. Conclusions: humans, not rats, were responsible
for Rapa Nui’s deforestation
Our investigations arrive at the deﬁnite conclusion that humans,
and not rats or climate variations, destroyed Rapa Nui’s palm
woodland. This conclusion is based on the following ﬁndings:

 The degradation of palm regeneration by palm seed consuming
rats has played at best a minor role. Less than 10% of the
charred palm nuts carry teeth marks from rats.
 Rats cannot kill mature trees. Because of their long lifetime,
palms that were fully grown in the 13th, 14th or 15th centuries
could have survived until the ﬁrst European contact time, if
people had not cut them down.
 The relicts of palm stumps in many places demonstrate that
these trees were felled by man. The palms were cut efﬁciently
in large areas. Often, labor and material was invested to burn
the stumps.
 Widespread ash and carbon layers show that ﬁres burned over
extensive areas.
 The root casts of the palms were preserved in the soil under the
inﬂuence of ﬁre and heat. Therefore, we could only ﬁnd the roots
casts of the last palm generation. We found two generations of
palm trees cut and burned only at the western slope of Rano
Raraku. The second palm generation grew there in a colluvial
sediment resulting from water erosion after the ﬁrst clearance.
 The diverse structure of the roots and stumps of the last palm
woodland found in the soil proﬁles also proves the presence of
young palms. Thus, young palm trees still existed some
centuries after the introduction of rats and ﬁrst deceased with
the onset of clearing and burning.
 A section at Rano Raraku shows that palm trees were capable of
regenerating after the initial woodland clearance. Also, this
implies that rats were not able to prevent all palm regeneration.
 Pollen proxies in the lake sediments verify a long existence of
the palm woodland on Rapa Nui before the appearance of
humans and despite all climatic variations which occurred
from the late Pleistocene to the late Holocene.
 Charred remains of short-lived parts of the palms like endocarps, dated between 1200 AD and 1450 AD, support the
conclusion that the people felled living trees and not trees that
were already dead (e.g. caused by a major drought period
which might have occurred before colonization). Un-charred
endocarps from dead trees would normally have been
decomposed within a few years or decades and would not have

426

A. Mieth, H.-R. Bork / Journal of Archaeological Science 37 (2010) 417–426

been available in such great numbers for burning events that
happened centuries (or even millennia) after an assumed
drought and decease of palms.
 The chronological sequence of ﬁre events on Rapa Nui over some
centuries and the introduction of new land use systems that took
place immediately after the ﬁre events underscore human intent
and thoroughness in the elimination of the palm woodland.
 Small healthy populations of Jubaea palms coexist with populations of seed-eating rodents in central Chile and show the
successful adaptation of the palms to pressure by animal
consumption.
