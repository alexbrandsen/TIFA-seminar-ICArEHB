Abstract
Early research suggests that examination of the microscopic internal structure is a valid method for distinguishing burned from unburned
bone in the archaeological record. This study compares burned and unburned modern bones with archaeological bones from Sibudu Cave
(ca. 60,000 years ago) and Cave of Hearths (over 200,000 years ago) to more fully describe the heat-induced histological changes to bone.
We also explore the effects of diagenesis on those changes to determine if histological evidence of burning preserves through fossilisation
and diagenetic processes and can be successfully used to identify ancient burning. Application of this technique can help in addressing various
issues, including the origins of controlled use of fire and understanding animal butchery and disposal.

1. Introduction
The identification of hominin-controlled fire and cooking in
the archaeological record is an important line of evidence in
unravelling ancient behaviour. Fire provides light, heat, protection from predators, assistance in hunting, and a means of
cooking meat and plant materials (Bellomo and Harris,
1990; James, 1989; Oakley, 1961). Researchers, therefore,
have long been concerned with identifying the early use of
fire at archaeological sites (Clark and Harris, 1985); however,
many assertions for the earliest use of fire still remain controversial (Binford and Stone, 1986; Dart, 1948; Goldberg et al.,
2001; Oakley, 1961; Weiner et al., 1998; Yu-Zhu, 1986).
Researchers employ a range of analyses to demonstrate or
disprove hominin use of fire (Barbetti, 1986; Bellomo and
Kean, 1994; Brain, 1993; Schiegl et al., 1996; Shipman
et al., 1984), and, as an abundant material that preserves in
most archaeological sites, bone is often evaluated for thermal

alterations in attempts to identify use of fire. Burned bone is
a good indicator of fire because it is very susceptible to
heat, and changes in bone are frequently distinctive and are
usually not affected by recovery techniques.
Thermally altered bone displays surface colour and texture
changes (Brain, 1993; David, 1990; Shipman et al., 1984),
which some argue can be good indicators of the temperature
to which the bone was heated, as well as to the duration of
the heating (Brain, 1981, 1993). When burned, bone surface
first darkens to brown (at less than 400  C), then carbonises,
turning black (typically around 400e500  C), and once the organic components are burned, the bone will become grey to
grey-blue in colour (at 600e900  C) (Bonucci and Graziani,
1975; Brain, 1993; Correia, 1997; Shipman et al., 1984). In
the final stage, the bone becomes calcined, developing a chalky
consistency and white colour (Brain, 1993). Heated bones also
display observable cracking and occasional longitudinal fractures (Correia, 1997; David, 1990). Unfortunately, visual surface assessments can be misleading as organic and mineral
staining can mimic colour changes (Oakley, 1961; ShahackGross et al., 1997), and the surface of weathered bone sometimes resembles that of burned bone (Sillen and Hoering,
1993; Stiner et al., 1995; Taylor et al., 1995; White, 1992).

M. Hanson, C.R. Cain / Journal of Archaeological Science 34 (2007) 1902e1913

Several researchers have therefore turned to more rigorous analyses of surface and internal structure to identify burned bone.
After examining the most superficial layers of experimentally burned bones at 55,000 magnification, Bonucci and
Graziani (1975) found that hydroxyapatite crystals thickened
as temperature increased until the orderly crystalline structure
of the bones disintegrated at 900  C, with the first noticeable
indication of burning appearing at 350  C. Using this experimental data, Bonucci and Graziani (1975) were able to
identify similar crystal changes in 2500-year-old cremated
human bone, but they had more difficulty identifying such
changes in older, apparently burned fossilised bone from Mousterian levels at an Italian cave site. (Bonucci and Graziani
(1975) also conducted thermogravimetry studies to identify
changes in burned bone, but they were inconclusive when applied to ancient bone and have seldom, if ever, been used since.)
Using experimentally heated bone, Shipman et al. (1984)
delineated a series of colour and surface changes, visible
with both light and scanning electron microscopy, that occur
as heating progresses to higher temperatures, with the first
indication of burning appearing between 185  C and 285  C.
The applicability of these schemes to archaeological assemblages is preliminarily confirmed by Nicholson’s (1993)
work. However, as both Nicholson (1993) and White (1992)
have noted, similar surface texture and colour changes can
occur on unburned bones diagenetically altered by weathering
and fossilisation. The high-powered microscopic surface analyses performed by Bonucci and Graziani (1975) and Shipman
et al. (1984), in the end, possess many of the same problems as
macroscopic surface analysesdburning, weathering, and
diagenesis all cause similar changes to the bone surface and
the causes of these changes can be confused.
Chemical analyses of reportedly burned bone can test for
the presence of organic carbon, the carbon: nitrogen ratio,
ammonia (NH3) levels or amino acid patterns; all of which
are associated with burning in bone (Brain and Sillen, 1988;
Sillen and Hoering, 1993; Taylor et al., 1995). While organic
carbon analyses can distinguish between bone that is black in
colour due to heating and bone that is black due to staining by
manganese oxide, they cannot work on bone after the carbon
has oxidised, which usually occurs between 600  C and
900  C (temperatures that are within the range of human
campfires). Sillen and Hoering (1993) note that the data
from carbon: nitrogen analyses can be difficult to interpret
and Taylor et al. (1995) conclude that the ammonia and amino
acid analyses might not work on bones that had undergone
long periods of diagenesis. All of these chemical analyses
fail to provide information on the intensity of heating, including temperature or duration.
Experimental work has shown that x-ray diffraction and
infra-red spectrometry can be used to identify heat-induced
crystallographic transformations in modern bones (Shipman
et al., 1984; Sillen and Hoering, 1993; Stiner et al., 1995),
but applications to archaeological material have had mixed results. Stiner et al. (1995) found that when the technique was
used on Middle Palaeolithic archaeological bone from Hayonim Cave, Israel, the signatures displayed no significant

1903

differences between burned and unburned specimens, whereas
Shahack-Gross et al. (1997) were able to differentiate between
infra-red spectra from burned and unburned bones from the
same site. Shahack-Gross et al. (1997) did note that it is
possible that other forms of diagenesis could result in bones
with similar spectra to that of pyrolised collagen. Others
have noted that it is difficult to recognise changes in crystal
size in archaeological bone that was heated to less than
650  C (Harsanyi, 1993; Stiner et al., 1995).
Because weathering and fossilisation do not significantly
affect the internal structure of the bone, examining bone
histology (the internal structure as visible with light microscopy) is at this stage a reliable indicator of burning without
the problems of equifinality seen in the techniques previously
mentioned. Much of the microscopic analysis of the internal
structure of burned bone to date has been conducted by forensic anthropologists, who have identified important heatinduced changes to human bone histology (Bradtmiller and
Buikstra, 1984; Cattaneo et al., 1999; Forbes, 1941; Harsanyi,
1993; Herrmann, 1977; Hummel and Schutkowski, 1993;
Nelson, 1992). Only a few archaeologists have pursued such
investigations. Schiegl et al. (1996) examined thin soil
sections with in situ bone as part of a study of hearths and
chemical and other signatures of burning. They reported that
the colour of the apparently burned bones in thin section
varied from pale brown to dark brown and deep black.
Brain (1993) documented accentuation of the lamellar
structure from carbon deposition (which he attributed to
carbonised organic components), cracks spreading through
the matrix, and a general loss of microstructure at high temperatures. In his experiment, Brain (1993) burned bone
sections to seven different temperatures in a kiln for 30 min.
His results are presented in Table 1. Brain used his experimental
observations to assign approximate temperatures to four
reportedly burned fossil specimens from the early hominid
(1.0e1.5 MYR BP) site of Swartkrans. The descriptions in
this research were limited, however, and there were no
descriptions of the histological features of unburned fossils.

While needing further investigation, this work importantly
suggests that heat-induced changes within the range of
human campfires (which usually range between 400  C and
700  C) can be documented after fossilisation and therefore
reliably confirm burning in very ancient bones (Brain,
1993). This research was critical in showing the usefulness
of the technique and greatly influenced this study.
Because further research associated with this technique is
limited, the aim of this study is to provide a well-defined
and systematic set of characteristics for identifying burned
bone histologically. We also aim to employ a range of experimental conditions to document additional variation not seen
in Brain’s work, particularly potential changes deriving from
conditions within campfires. We also want to show that this
technique can be applied to faunal material from a range of
archaeological sitesdincluding material that has undergone
or is undergoing fossilisation, and faunal material that may
be experiencing other post-burial taphonomic changes.
To confirm that histological changes are due to heating,
diagenetic changesdsuch as modifications by pathologies
and destruction by microbial actiondmust be ruled out (Brain,
1993; Chinsamy, 1997; Grun, 2003; Hackett, 1981; Hedges
et al., 1995; Romer and Parsons, 1986). Fungi and bacteria
digest the remaining collagen in the bones, and in doing so
excrete enzymes to put the bone mineral into solution, occasionally creating distinct changes to the histology of the
bone (Garland, 1987; Grupe and Dreses-Werringloer, 1993;
Hackett, 1981; Schultz, 1997). Our identifications of nonburning diagenetic changes are based on these published
reports, and we are pleased with their usefulness (although
future studies may refine the database). The most common
types of microbial destruction have been described by Hackett
(1981) as small round holes in the microstructure, occasionally
with a rim of redeposited mineral around the edge of the hole.
Schultz (1997) also described algal and fungal growth vestiges, both of which can sometimes merge together to form
large flat or tuft shaped obstructions, noting that such destruction can even cause the entire bone to disintegrate (Schultz,
1997). Garland (1987) also observed three other types of histological destruction, which he termed generalised destruction,
inclusions, and infiltrations. He describes generalised destruction as a disintegration of osteons resulting in an amorphous
appearance to the bone (Garland, 1987). Inclusions are biological or mineral material lying in the spaces in the bone, while
infiltrations are in terra staining, usually opaque black or
brown, penetrating the cortex of the bone (Garland, 1987),
which may result from infiltration of chemicals and elements
into the bone’s surface. We agree that such diagenetic changes
in bone are quite distinct in appearance to changes attributed
to extreme heat (Brain, 1993; Garland, 1987; Hackett, 1981;
Schiegl et al., 2003; Shipman et al., 1984).

of two sets of archaeological burned and unburned bones of
different ages.
2.1. Experimental samples
The modern comparative sample consisted of ten adult
sheep (Ovis aries) defleshed femora and two adult sheep
humeri with the flesh still on. Two of the femora were
defleshed, cleaned and left raw as a control, and two were
defleshed, cleaned and degreased by simmering in soapy water
for several hours in preparation for burning. It is highly
unlikely that this degreasing method caused any histological
changes to the bones, as the water never reached temperatures
much over 100  C, and no research has found heat-induced
histological changes to bone until temperatures reached
more than 185  C (Brain, 1993; Nicholson, 1993; Shipman
et al., 1984). The remainder of the defleshed bones was
cleaned and left greasy. All bones were left whole and intact.
Studies (Drew et al., 1971; Wright and Miller, 1976; Zeder,
1978; for summary see Gilbert, 1989) have identified some
histological differences between wild and domestic bovid
bone, but these distinctions were unrelated to histological
indicators of burning, and we were therefore confident in comparing thin sections of elements from wild (ancient material)
and domestic (modern material) taxa for evidence of burning.
The experimental campfire was built with a variety of hardwoods and was approximately 60 cm in diameter. The fire was
built on a cleared patch of dirt in a well-ventilated area and the
temperature of the fire was measured using a digital thermometer attached to a long thermocouple probe (same thermometer
and probe described in Brain, 1993). The centre of the fire
reached 367  C within 10 min, and the maximum temperature
d705  Cdwas reached after 20 min. After that point, temperatures declined. The exposure to the effects of heat of specimens varied based on their position and duration in the fire
(Table 2).
Six bones were put in the fire ten minutes after setting (see
Table 2). The last fuel was added at about 30 min into the
experiment; and at 35 min, some of the coals were spread
out and the fleshed samples were roasted until cooked through.
The temperature of the fire next to each sample was measured
when the bone was added and at ten minute intervals.
After removal, samples were cooled and bagged. Many
specimens fractured in the fire, but an effort was made to
recover all pieces. Later, samples were photographed and
described, and pieces were selected for thin sectioning (see
Hanson, 2005 for photographs and detailed descriptions).
Each of these sections was from the shaft and cut transverse
to the long axis of the bone, in order to facilitate comparisons
with previous work.

2. Materials and methods
This study compared the internal microscopic changes of
experimentally burned bones with microscopic characteristics

One set of archaeological bone was selected from the Middle Stone Age layers at Sibudu Cave, in KwaZulu Natal, South
Africa (Wadley and Jacobs, 2004), which have abundant
evidence of hearths, ash and burning (Cain, 2005). The eight

bone fragments used come from two layers, MOD and Mi.
MOD was dated to 49,700  1800 ya (Wadley and Jacobs,
2006). Mi, several layers below MOD, is a ‘‘black, charcoalrich, ashy layer’’ (Wadley, 2001: p. 7) and is believed to
date to approximately 60,000 ya (Wadley and Jacobs, 2006).
All specimens were from femora or humeri (with the exception of one fragment identifiable only to ‘long bone’) from
bovid size class II or III. Due to the widespread burning of
bones throughout the site (Cain, 2005), it was difficult to
find identifiable unburned fragments and thus specimens
display a range of burning intensity, identified from visual
inspection (Cain): Five samples appear substantially burned,
one partly burned, one slightly burned, and one unburned
(see Hanson, 2005 for pictures).
The other archaeological samples were selected from the
Cave of Hearths assemblage in Limpopo province, South
Africa (Mason, 1988). The Early Stone Age assemblage
from which the bones were selected is estimated conservatively
by faunal and artefact correlations to be between 150,000 and
200,000 ya (Partridge, 2000), although recent electron spin
resonance work by Grun (2003) suggests the youngest bed
may be in excess of 400,000 ya. Evidence for use of controlled
fire at Cave of Hearths has been somewhat disputed, with some
researchers identifying hearths and layers of ash in the three
ESA beds (Mason, 1988), and others finding a lack of organic
carbon in the reported ‘‘ash’’ and a lack of magnetic evidence
for sediment burning (Oakley, 1954; Herries, pers. commun.).
Ogola (2003) reported that about 14% of the assemblage may
be burned based on macroscopic visual assessment. The sample selected included eight bone fragments, four burned and
four unburned, as identified by Ogola (2003). The samples
are all femora and humeri from bovids in size class II. The
colour and texture of the bones identified as burned varies
greatly among samples (see Hanson, 2005 for pictures).
2.3. Thin section preparation
Transverse sections were cut using a diamond-tipped saw,
then ground by hand to a thickness of approximately 50 mm

and polished. All thin sections were examined using transmitted
light microscopy. Each section was viewed at several magnifications (40, 100 and 200) and digitally photographed
(Hanson, 2005). The experimental sections were assessed for
evidence of burning and all archaeological sections were
assessed for both diagenetic change and evidence of burning.
Assessment methods are largely based on the work of Brain
(1993) and Hedges et al. (1995), and are explained in detail
in Hanson (2005). The diagensis index formulated by Hedges
et al. (1995), assigns a number to the preservation of microstructure in a bone, ranging from 0 (completely obscured) to
5 (perfectly clear).
3. Results
3.1. Description of experimental material
Based on our observations, a consistent pattern of histological changes in relation to heating history appeared. The samples have been grouped accordingly into five levels of heating
(Table 3). This method was preferred over assigning specific
temperature ranges to samples because intensity is a factor
of both temperature and duration, and bones with distinct heating histories sometimes had similar appearances. The aim of
this study was to document changes and variations to bones
heated in campfires rather than under controlled conditions.
Our results can be compared with Brain’s (1993) controlled
temperature, closed oven experiments. See Table 2 for the
heating history of each specimen.
The bones in the none/low intensity level all exhibited
a white to light tan colour, clearly visible histological features,
no accumulations of carbon, and no cracks in the matrix
(Fig. 1A). Significantly, there are no apparent differences
between the unheated samples and M1, the first fleshed sample. However, both the fleshed sample that cooked for a longer
time and the sample that was roasted in the coals had slightly
darker tan colouration than the others in this category, though
they remain alike in other characteristics. This suggests that
bones, fleshed or otherwise, under low intensity heat may

The sample in the lowemedium intensity level was a dark
tan throughout the centre of the cross section and reddishbrown and black at the edges (Fig. 1B). There were deposits
of carbon around the edges of the sample, but no visible cracking coming from the haversian canals.
The characteristics of samples in the medium intensity
include carbon deposition at the edges of the sample and clustered around the spaces in the matrixdthe lacunae and the
haversian canals. Samples displayed a variety of colours,
from dark tan and yellow intensifying to reddish-brown,
dark brown and blackdacross the same thin section
(Fig. 1C). A few cracks spread outward from the haversian
canals.
The samples in the mediumehigh intensity category were
characterised by almost completely opaque, blackened centres
due to extensive carbon deposition. The extreme edges of the
samples were white and lack histological structure (Fig. 1D).
Some cracks spread through the bone.
The high intensity level includes specimens with black,
opaque colouration in the centre due to extensive carbon deposition. The samples fade to white at the edges which have lost

the carbon accumulations and histological structure (Fig. 1E).
The white extends much farther into the centre than in the
medium-high category sections. Cracking was visible in
some areas. In addition to cracks spreading from the haversian
canals in Sample M8, fine criss-crossed cracks were visible at
many edges (Fig. 2).
The changes observed in the experimentally-burned material were consistent with previous findings (Brain, 1993; Herrmann, 1977; Shipman et al., 1984), although the use of an
open campfire produced specimens that expressed more variation across the thin section.

3.2. Description of Sibudu material
The Sibudu Cave samples are generally well preserved
histologically (the material does not appear to be fossilised
but we assume that some chemical change is likely to have
occurred to the material during the last 50,000 years based
on chemical descriptions of the soil matrix). While some areas
were occasionally obscured by histological destructions unrelated to burning, enough matrix was visible to assess the level
of burning. The histological condition of each sample is shown
in Table 4.
Four of the Sibudu samples were consistent with the none/
low intensity experimental material. Colours in the samples
were uniform and ranged from tan and light orange to light
brown and were generally pale (Fig. 1F). There were no accumulations of carbon in the spaces in the matrix and no cracks
coming from the haversian canals. One edge of Sample S3 had
possible indications of burning at a high intensity (crisscrossed cracks and a small very light area where the structure
has disappeared, much like that of sample M8), but the area is
very small and localised. Sample S2, while mostly free of any
diagenetic obstruction, did have an opaque stain extending in
from one edge and appearing superimposed on the surrounding matrix (Fig. 3). This characteristic closely resembles
Garland’s (1987) description of infiltrations, or in terra staining. It was not confused with carbon deposits because it was
well defined and localised.
Samples S5 and S7, assigned to the low medium category,
had a yellow or light tan colour in the centre, becoming darker
towards the edges. Carbon deposition was visible only at the
very edges. There were, however, a number of cracks that
spread outwards from the haversian canals and some not associated with the canals (Fig. 1G).
In the medium level, the colour of Sample S4 varied across
the section, from yellow at one side to red in the middle and
a deep reddish/black on the other edge. The accumulations
of carbon around the haversian canals and in other spaces
was rather extensive in the darker areas of the section
(Fig. 1H), and cracks were visible spreading out from the
osteons in all areas of the section.
The centre of the Sample S6, assigned to the high level, was
much darker than the edges, with extensive carbon deposition
in the centre darker area. The section displayed a severe loss of
structure and large cracks at one end, and small criss-crossed

cracks at the other end (Fig. 1I). This sample also displayed
one opaque infiltration, much like sample S2.
3.3. Description of Cave of Hearths material
Two of the fossilised Cave of Hearths samples (C1 and C4)
had such severe histological diagenesis that we were unable to
make any conclusions about their burning status (Fig. 1M).
One sample, C1, was entirely obscured in a fuzzy grey with
blue-green areas, while the other, C4, was almost entirely
covered with cloudy, greyish-green material. In both samples,
areas of the destruction were less amorphous than that of the
Sibudu samples, and the foreign material seemed thicker and
more defined, resembling the focal destructions described by
Garland (1987) and Hackett (1981). This observation may suggest that the greater antiquity or specific taphonomic history of
the Cave of Hearths material resulted in greater disruption of
histological structure; however, it is clear that most specimens
retain sufficient structure to discuss burning history. The
histological preservation of all Cave of Hearths samples is
described in Table 4.
Two samples (C3 and C5) had all the attributes of the low
intensity experimental samples: pale matrix colours (white or
tan with some greyish or brown clouding) and no visible accumulation of carbon (Fig. 1J). Any cracks in the matrix are
unassociated with the haversian canals and are usually along
osteon cement lines. Sample C5, however, had extensive,
small, thin cracks across much of the specimen, a trait which
has otherwise been found occurring at the edges of severely
burned samples and associated with a loss of microstructure.
In C5, the histological structure is still intact (Fig. 4), so these
cracks may be from sediment pressure, diagenetic change,
fossilisation or other undetermined factors.
Three samples (C6, C7 and C8) had the traits of mediume
low intensity heating, with matrices ranging from light to medium yellow-orange-brown colours with some significantly

darker brown areas in C7 (Fig. 1K). All three had some carbon
deposition in spaces throughout the matrix. Some of the cracks
in the matrix appear to have no association with the canals,
while other cracks stretch outwards from the canals or follow
cement lines. In C8, there were significant numbers of small
criss-crossed cracks along one edge of the sample. These
cracks were associated with white colouration and loss of

4. Discussion

structuredtraits indicative of high intensity heating. This
cracked and structure-less area only comprises a very small
portion of the sample, however, and could indicate localised
heating, diagenetic changes, sediment pressure, or cracking
during fossilisation.
The only sample assigned to the high category, C2, did not
closely resemble any experimental samples in this study, but
was similar to one of Brain’s (1993: p. 232, his figure 5e)
experimental bones heated to 500  C. The matrix was a light
colour. Numerous cracks spread through the matrix, many
emanating from the haversian canals (Fig. 1L) surrounded
by brown discolouration, which sometimes extends further
accenting the lacunae.

The comparisons between the experimental and archaeological samples were, for the most part, straightforward:
archaeological sections displayed similar characteristics to
the experimental samples. Our assessments of the archaeological samples generally matched the previous macroscopic
analyses of the bones, as made by one of us (C.R.C.) and
Ogola (Table 5). Among the Sibudu samples, two of our
assessments did not match previous classifications. While
sample S3 was previously identified as partly burned, we
had placed it in the low intensity category as histological analysis showed only a few signs of heating along one edge. It is
quite possible that the bone was burned only on one side. Such
variation was also observed across experimental specimens
and probably relates to the variation in temperature, duration,
and specimen completeness. Sample S8 was classified as
extremely burned by the outside appearance (which was greyish-white in colour, with some longitudinal splitting and rough
texture), but the histology gave no indications of changes
caused by burning. This sample was different in macroscopic
appearance than other burned bones from the site, and it is
possible that the surface colour and texture are the result of
weathering or bio-physical destruction.
Among the Cave of Hearths samples, only C5 and C2 did
not match the macroscopic classification. Section C5, while
macroscopically identified as burned, has normal, unburned
histological characteristics and a significant number of crisscrossed cracks, which are not indicative of burning in this
case as they are not at the edges of the sample, and associated
with a white matrix colour or a loss of histological structure.
The surface evidence is probably indicative of another taphonomic agent, perhaps related to the extensive cracking. The
characteristics displayed in section C2 were unlike any that
we found in the experimentally heated or unheated samples.
Macroscopically identified as unburned, we tentatively assigned this bone to the medium-high category, based on its
similarity to one of Brain’s (1993) experimentally heated
bones. Further research on physical and biological postdepositional processes may reveal a non-burning related
taphonomic explanation for the appearance of this specimen.
4.1. Reliability of histological characteristics

criss-crossed cracks. Scale bar: 300 mm.

The deposition of carbon in the spaces throughout the
matrix was a very good indicator of burning in both the experimental and archaeological sections. Carbon accumulations
usually began at the edges of the samples, accentuating the
lamellate structure, and continued inwards as burning intensity
increased, depositing carbon throughout the entire structure
and sometimes rendering the section opaque. Brain (1993)
describes a reversion to pale-coloured matrix as the carbon
oxidises at sustained temperatures above 500  C, but we
observed this characteristic only at the edges of the most
intensely heated experimental samples.
Cracking is cited as a histological and macroscopic indication of burning by many researchers (Brain, 1993; Forbes,

1941; Shipman et al., 1984). Among the experimentally
burned samples, we found a variety of cracksdfrom the
haversian canals, along osteon cement lines, at random orientations and some fine cracks along the edges of intensely
heated specimens. There were no cracks in the unheated
experimental specimens. In the archaeological sections, cracks
appeared in both the burned and unburned bones. This situation may mean that much cracking is associated with burning,
but other post-depositional processes may also produce cracking. Some researchers describe cracks from the haversian
canals as indicative of burning (Brain, 1993; Forbes, 1941),
and indeed that type of crack was often associated with other
characteristics of burning in the archaeological bones.
However, there were also other cracks in the archaeological
burned bone.
Some archaeological samples (S3, S6, and C8) displayed
the criss-crossed cracks that we noticed in a high intensity
experimental sample (M8). When the criss-crossed cracks
were located at the edges of the sample and were associated with structural disintegration and white matrix colour,
they appear to indicate a very high level of localised burning.
Absent those other traits (as in C5), however, the cracks may
be more indicative of post-depositional processes such as
soil compaction and pressure, physical disintegration of the
bone, or even post-depositional burning. It is not possible
to diagnose bones as burned on the basis of microstructural
cracks alone.
Research on heated bones describes fusion of mineral crystals and subsequent disappearance of histological structure at
temperatures above about 700  C (Brain, 1993; Harsanyi,
1993; Herrmann, 1977; Shipman et al., 1984). No experimental samples were kept at sustained temperature of above
700  C; however, the surfaces of some intensely heated bones
did turn white and shades of light blue. In thin section, these
bones displayed white edges and a lack of histological structure and wide cracks at the edges. This suite of characteristics
was seen in the archaeological specimens and thus seems to be
a reliable indicator of very intense heating rather than specifically high temperature.
The different matrix colours in experimentally burned samplesdfrom pale tans and shades of white in the unburned
bones, to stages of yellows, oranges, reds, browns, blacks,
and up to white again in the burned bonesdwere diagnostic
of burning. These colours had been previously recorded by

Shipman et al. (1984); Brain (1993) and Nicholson (1993).
The matrix colours of the archaeological samples varied
more than the experimental samples, but progressed through
the same sequence. We would be careful in making direct
correlations between modern and archaeological samples on
the basis of colour alone because other processes may change
the colour of an ancient bone in thin section, including contact
with trace elements in the sediments (Oakley, 1954). Additionally, colour varies with type of microscope, light source, the
thickness of the section, and perception of researchers.
The real significance of these changes in histological
appearance is that taken together they clearly differentiate
burned from non-burned bone and differentiate stages of burning. Carbon deposits, cracks, colour changes, and loss of structure are excellent indicators of burning. Descriptions of these
characteristics and the photomicrographs will ease further
research and application of this technique.
The experimental portion of this study compared fully
fleshed to defleshed bones and greasy to non-greasy bones.
We found that fully fleshed bones, cooked to temperatures
that left the meat edible, show no indications of being heated.
The insulating effect of the meat kept the temperature of the
bone no higher than 100  C, even for long periods of time.
There were some differences between the greasy and nongreasy bones. The greasy bones sizzled when added to the
fire and took longer than degreased bones to darken in colour.
The two degreased bones, M3 and M4, did reach higher heating levels histologically than the two greasy bones heated at
similar temperatures for similar durations (M6 and M7,
respectively). We suggest that bone condition is an important
factor to burning in that it affects final bone condition as
temperature and duration do.
The experiment also showed, through comparisons to previous work, that open fires and closed ovens produce similar
changes to bone microstructure, though fires are more variable
and the resulting evidence of burning is less uniformly distributed across the thin section. In cases like that of samples M4
(heated at approximately 620  C for 11 min) and M6 (heated
at between 480  C and 195  C for 63 min) with different
heating histories but similar appearances in thin section, it is
obvious that intensity is a factor of both temperature and duration. Researchers must be wary when assigning burned
bone to a temperature range without taking other considerations into account.

4.2. Other alterations seen in archaeological thin
sections
About half of all the archaeological samples had some visible non-burning diagenetic destruction. Several types were
observed, were distinguished easily from burning damage,
and for the most part, did not impede the recognition of
changes caused by burning. Only when the microstructure
was entirely obscured or destroyed did diagenetic change
interfere. Histological analysis to identify burned bone is
therefore applicable to most archaeological assemblages,
including fossilised faunal assemblages with moderate to
good bone preservation. But as a note of caution, bones may
have to be sectioned to assess histological preservation, as
visual assessment of the exterior of a bone might not be
a sufficient indicator (Garland, 1987; Stout, 1978). Considering the size of most faunal assemblages, this assessment is
minimally destructive and the same samples can be used for
the histological study.
Although this technique has clarity, reliability, and accuracy, it cannot verify human involvement alone. Since very
old evidence of fire is rare and notoriously contentious, identification of an early site exhibiting controlled use of fire
requires corroboration from several different sources. As
a detailed and varied record of past changes, bone histology
may be able to provide important clues into burning. In this
study, we
 were able to confirm the presence of burning in ancient archaeological specimens,
 demonstrated a range of burning intensities at each site
that could be consistent with (but not necessarily indicative of) burning of bone specimens in a human-produced
fire,
 identified that physical and biological post-depositional
processes were creating modifications on some specimens
that were confused with burning using only macroscopic
analysis,
 produced a catalogue of images that researchers can use to
apply and develop this technique, and
 showed that this technique can be applied to a range of
sites (those with fair to good preservation).
5. Conclusion
Histological analysis is not commonly used by archaeologists looking at animal and human bones. This method could
be particularly useful for more ancient assemblages where
potentially burned bones are rare and the identification of
burning in an early period is rather significant. At later sites,
it is particularly suited to spot-checking macroscopic visual
assessments in a large assemblage. At some sites, the record
of burning and controlled use of fire may be better preserved
in archaeological bone than it is in other organic material
such as charcoal and ash, particularly over long periods. Direct
evidence for hearths could potentially be detected in concentrations of bone fragments studied in thin section.

1911

This technique identified some characteristics that may help
identify the pre-burning condition of bone. It confirmed the
insulating effect of flesh in protecting fleshed parts of bones
from significant burning damage. Also, degreased bone
quickly becomes highly burned when exposed to heatdmuch
more rapidly than greasy bone. Therefore, a faunal assemblage
displaying a range of burning intensities could possibly represent an assemblage with significant numbers of greasy bones
that were burned. Much more study is necessary to identify
and interpret assemblages with a range of burning histories
represented. Although difficult, this line of research is important because pre-burning condition is a part of discussion of
human cremation, use of animal bone for fuel, and animal
butchery and disposal. Understanding how humans and hominin ancestors used fire contributes to understanding human
behavioural and social evolution.
Further research is needed on this topic. A study of the microstructure of weathered or geologically compressed or stressed
bone would help to understand the appearance of cracks in
burned bone microstructure. A range of post-depositional
taphonomic processes, in addition to those we are helping
document for burning, may have distinctive histological signatures preserved in the microscopic structures of bone. Specifically, as one anonymous reviewer pointed out, freezeethaw
effects and significant weathering should also be studied to
identify criteria for identification and to potentially differentiate
these criteria from those of burning, soil compaction, and other
alterations.
With more actualistic and archaeological analyses using
this technique and analysis of larger samples, additional diagnostic criteria and new applications will be possible.
