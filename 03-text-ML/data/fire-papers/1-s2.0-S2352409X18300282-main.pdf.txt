Despite the current growing number of studies that focus on macrobotanical remains from Middle Palaeolithic
contexts, plant use among hunter-gatherer societies remains unknown in many regions of Europe. Large-scale
ﬂotation of archaeological sediments has made it possible to recover a large amount of plant remains (fruits,
seeds and wood) from units VIII, IX, Xa and Xb at El Salt, Eastern Iberia (49.2–52.3 ka BP). The combination of
anthracological and carpological analyses has provided a more accurate picture of the Middle Palaeolithic
landscape in the Serpis valley, as well as signiﬁcant information about other possible uses of plants, not only as
fuel, but for woodworking or food, for instance. A minimum of twenty diﬀerent taxa have been identiﬁed among
the plant remains. Charcoal analysis suggested that ﬁrewood was gathered from nearby sources (< 1 km), with a
predominance of black-scots pine woodlands (Pinus nigra-sylvestris) and maples (Acer sp.). The carpological data
reveal the use of some woody taxa not documented in the anthracological record (Taxus baccata or yew) and the
presence of few mineralised seeds whose origin remains unknown (Celtis australis or hackberry, Rubus cf. laciniatus or evergreen blackberry). These data have signiﬁcant implications for the interpretation of plant economy
among Neanderthal groups, reinforcing the importance of available woody resources in the surroundings for the
subsistence of the group.

1. Introduction
The study of the subsistence practices of hunter-gatherer societies
has traditionally focused on hunting, leaving the role of the plants
unknown (Haws, 2004; Aura et al., 2005; Pryor et al., 2013; Bigga et al.,
2015). This is partly due to taphonomic problems and those regarding
the preservation of organic remains, in addition to the lack of recovered
plant remains based on the assumption that they are only preserved in
exceptional conditions (Madella et al., 2002; Badal et al., 2012b; Pryor
et al., 2013; Martínez and Badal, 2018). In recent decades, the increasing application of systematic recovery methods by ﬂotation of
sediments has made it possible to perform more studies that focus on
macrobotanical remains from Palaeolithic and Mesolithic contexts
(Uzquiano, 1992; Théry-Parisot et al., 1996; Gale and Carruthers, 2000;
Goren-Inbar et al., 2002; Théry-Parisot, 2002; Aura et al., 2005;

Martínez, 2017; Martínez and Badal, 2018; Vidal-Matutano et al.,
2017a). More recently, the introduction of new archaeobotanical disciplines has led to the development of methodological advances in
order to obtain essential information about diﬀerent uses of plants,
other than for fuel, among hunter-gatherer groups (Hardy and Garuﬁ,
1998; Richards et al., 2000; Dominguez-Rodrigo et al., 2001; Madella

2001), i.e. superimposed ﬂat combustion features of various sizes
(0.20–1 m diameter) associated with rich archaeological assemblages
including faunal remains, lithic objects, limestone pebbles with usewear and wood-charcoal fragments. Excavation of subunit Xb has led to
the identiﬁcation of an initial division of the palimpsest deposit into
several ﬁne-grained analytical units called archaeosedimentary facies
associations (henceforth, AFA). These units correspond to the highest
possible temporal resolution achievable within the studied context
(Machado and Pérez, 2016; Machado et al., 2016).

et al., 2017a, 2017b), there are still gaps that must be studied (VidalMatutano, 2016). In addition to this, few carpological remains have
been recovered and identiﬁed in these chronologies where the only
known assemblages from the Iberian Peninsula to date are the pine
kernels from Gorham's Cave and Vanguard Cave (Gale and Carruthers,
2000; Metcalf, 1964) or the mineralised Celtis seeds from Cueva del
Niño (García Moreno et al., 2014), fact possibly related to a lack of
sampling.
In this paper we present the results of the analysis of macrobotanical
remains recovered from units VIII, IX, Xa and Xb at El Salt, Eastern
Iberia (49.2–52.3 ka BP). The main objective is to provide information
about the use of plant resources during MIS 3 human occupations at El
Salt, a Middle Palaeolithic site which has yielded signiﬁcant information that contributes to a deeper knowledge of Neanderthal behaviour
based on a multidisciplinary approach (Galván et al., 2014a). On the
one hand, analysing fuel remains could shed light both on the local
landscape that would have existed in the Serpis valley at that time and
the areas that could have provided ﬁrewood resources. On the other
hand, it is important to analyse the carpological remains that have been
recovered in order to complement palaeoecological and palaeoeconomic data, as their presence may or may not be linked to the use of
fuel.

2.1. Current climatic and plant formations data
The climate in the study area is determined by the topography.
Rainfall is high compared with the local environment, with values close
to 500 mm per year and reaching 800 mm at the highest points (Serra
Mariola or Font Roja) (López Gómez and Rosselló Verger, 1978). Alcoy,
where both sites are located, is currently framed in the mesomediterranean bioclimatic belt with mean annual temperature or
MAT = 14.5 °C and a dry ombroclimate (mean annual precipitation or
MAP = 479 mm) (Rivas-Martinez, 1987).
Nowadays the Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) is the predominant
woody taxa in the region, followed by evergreen oaks (Quercus coccifera, Quercus rotundifolia) and legumes (Ulex parviﬂorus, Genista scorpius), terebinth (Pistacia terebinthus), mastic (Pistacia lentiscus),
Mediterranean buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and elmleaf blackberry (Rubus
ulmifolius). In the riverbank areas, poplar trees (Populus alba) and elms
(Ulmus minor) are frequent. The presence of a mixed relict forest of
Eurosiberian plant formations in the nearby mountain range of Font
Roja should be pointed out, where taxa such as deciduous oaks (Quercus
faginea, Quercus pubescens), ash (Fraxinus ornus), maple (Acer opalus
subsp. granatense), whitebeam (Sorbus aria and Sorbus torminalis) and
yew (Taxus baccata) are present (Costa et al., 2005; Serra Laliga and
Soler, 2011). Evidence of relict formations of yew are also present in the
higher altitude areas of Serra Mariola mountain range (Gualda Gómez,
1988; Costa et al., 2005).

2. Regional setting and excavation method
The site of El Salt is an open-air rock shelter located at 680 m a.s.l. in
the mountainous region of Alicante, Eastern Iberia (Fig. 1). The Middle
Palaeolithic sequence is represented by eight stratigraphic units dating
between 60.7 ± 8.9 and 45.2 ± 3.4 ka BP (Galván et al., 2014b). A
38-metre high Palaeocene limestone wall formed at a thrust fault and
covered with tufa and travertine gave refuge to the space occupied by
humans at the bottom of the wall, which would have covered almost
the entire excavated surface at times of maximum development. This
deposit has been systematically excavated since 1986 with an integrated multidisciplinary approach based on obtaining a higher temporal resolution of analysis related to Neanderthal behaviour (Mallol
et al., 2013b, 2013a; Galván et al., 2014b, 2014a; Garralda et al., 2014;
Sistiaga et al., 2014; Machado and Pérez, 2016; Rodríguez-Cintas and
Cabanes, 2015; Machado et al., 2016; Vidal-Matutano, 2017; VidalMatutano et al., 2017a). The stratigraphic sequence consists of a dense
palimpsest originating from recurrent human occupations, during
which several activities were carried out. These activities correspond to
the generic model of “hearth-related assemblages” (Vaquero and Pastó,

3. Materials and methods
3.1. Sampling method
During the archaeological ﬁeld seasons carried out between 2000
and 2012 all the sediment excavated from units VIII, IX and Xa was

processed by ﬂotation and water sieving using 5 and 2 mm sieves. With
regard to unit Xb, systematic ﬂotation of the sediments has been carried
out using smaller mesh sizes since 2013. Thus, the denser remains that
do not ﬂoat were collected using a 1 mm mesh positioned inside the
tank, while the ﬂots were collected onto a 0.25 mm external mesh
(Vidal-Matutano, 2016).

4.2. Seeds and fruits
The seed and fruit remains recovered in the samples are not very
frequent. A total of 7 taxa have been diﬀerentiated, although some of
the samples present a large number of fruit fragments. The density of
seeds and fruits is very low, ranging from 0.02 to 0.008. (Table 2 and
Fig. 2). Almost all the materials are charred. There are two taxa, Celtis
australis (Mediterranean hackberry) and Rubus cf. laciniatus (evergreen
blackberry), which are only mineralised, so there is some doubt about
whether they may be present-day intrusions. There is also some uncertainty about the determination of Rubus cf. laciniatus, a taxon of
unknown origin that is believed to have been introduced to Iberia
(Monasterio-Huelin, 1999), although it's unknown at what point.
As it has been mentioned for wood charcoal remains, the coarser
sieves used in older archaeological ﬁeld seasons provided fewer carpological remains than those obtained in unit Xb with smaller mesh
sizes. The charred material recovered includes a remarkable number of
Acer sp. remains, which only come from unit Xb. In subunit AFA 2, a
considerable concentration of maple fruits was found inside combustion
structure H57, together with wood charcoal fragments from this same
taxon, which seems to point to its use as fuel although maple fruits
could also serve as a food source (Kuhnlein and Turner, 1991). Other
taxa that appear with a similar frequency are Juniperus sabina (savin
juniper) and Fabaceae (legumes). Legumes are annual trees, shrubs or
plants that usually grow in the same place each year. This fact facilitates their collection which usually takes place at the end of spring or
beginnings of summer. Its seeds are rich in carbohydrates and proteins,
making them an excellent food resource available before autumn, when
Mediterranean forests produce most of their fruits. The seeds of this
family may possibly belong to the genus Vicia or Lathyrus, but we don't
have elements to conﬁrm this determination. In any case, their presence
at hunter-gatherer contexts is common (Aura et al., 2005; Martínez and
Badal, 2018). More occasionally other taxa are found, such as Galium
sp. (bedstraw) and Taxus baccata (yew).

3.2. Charcoal analysis
Each charcoal fragment was fractured manually to provide transverse, tangential and radial sections for taxonomic identiﬁcation using
a Nikon Optiphot-100 bright/dark ﬁeld incident light microscope with
50–500× magniﬁcation. Botanical identiﬁcation was performed with
specialised plant anatomy atlases (Jacquiot et al., 1973; Schweingruber,
1976), in addition to the reference collection of modern charred woody
taxa from the Department of Prehistory, Archaeology and Ancient
History, University of Valencia. The spatial information relating to the
current distribution of taxa has been obtained from the database of the
Anthos Project (www.anthos.es). These data have been processed using
GIS software (Quantum GIS v.2.10.1 “Pisa”).
3.3. Carpological analysis
Plant remains are preserved through carbonisation and mineralisation and they were identiﬁed using a binocular microscope (8–80×
magniﬁcation). Identiﬁcation was carried out by comparison with
modern specimens from the seed reference collection of the
Archaeobiology Lab of the Spanish National Research Council in
Madrid (Spain), and by consulting specialised literature on plant
anatomy. Botanical nomenclature follows Castroviejo (1986–2012).

5. Discussion

Previous studies have provided interesting data on anthracological
assemblages from combustion structures at El Salt (Vidal-Matutano,
2017; Vidal-Matutano et al., 2017a), so this work focuses on scattered
assemblages at the site. The scattered charcoal remains analysed from
units VIII, IX, Xa and Xb at El Salt comprise a total of 4263 charcoal
fragments and at least 17 taxa have been identiﬁed (Table 1). The
diﬀerence between the sampling and recovery methods used in earlier
and more recent ﬁeld campaigns means that it is diﬃcult to make a
comparison between units. In fact, the sampling from units VIII, IX and
Xa, which correspond to the ﬁeld seasons where coarser sieves were
used, has provided fewer macrobotanical remains than unit Xb, which
was sampled more recently.
The most representative taxa in the part of the sequence of El Salt
contemplated in this study are Pinus nigra-sylvestris (black-scots pine),
Juniperus sp. (juniper) and Acer sp. (maple). This overall pattern is seen
throughout these units, with a clear dominance of black-scots pine
(values of 75–85%), a lower frequency of juniper species (maximum
values of 10%) and a minor but constant presence of maples in all the
units. There are few examples of evergreen and deciduous Quercus
(oaks), and this is also the case with other taxa such as Buxus sempervirens (box), Fabaceae (the legume family), Rosaceae (the rose family),
Pistacia sp. (cf. terebinth), Hedera sp. (ivy), Monocotyledoneae, Ephedra
sp. (joint pine) and hygrophilous taxa such as Ulmus sp. (elm) and SalixPopulus (willow-poplar). With regard to the distinction between Pinus
nigra and Pinus sylvestris, it is not possible to identify the exact species
from anatomical criteria, so the nomenclature Pinus nigra-sylvestris has
been used by many authors to refer to the identiﬁcation of charred
wood from these two possible species (Badal and Carrión, 2001; Badal
et al., 2012a; Uzquiano et al., 2012; Roiron et al., 2013; Allué et al.,
2016; Vidal-Matutano, 2017; Vidal-Matutano et al., 2017a, 2017b;
Badal and Martínez, 2017).

5.1. Palaeoecological data
The scattered charcoal assemblage from El Salt is characterised by
the strong presence of cryophilous or medium-high Mediterranean
mountain pines (black pine or scots pine) (Fig. 3). The dominance of
Pinus nigra-sylvestris, with a proportion of 85–90% in some units, indicates that cryophilous pine forests must have played an important
role in the vegetation of the studied region during MIS 3. These
medium-high mountain pine forests would have been accompanied by a
variable presence of junipers and/or savins, together with a sub-Mediterranean ﬂora consisting of maples, evergreen/deciduous oaks and
shrub taxa such as boxwood, legumes, joint-pine and terebinth. The
occasional presence of charred ivy fragments in unit Xb (AFA 2) could
be the result of accidental combustion due to this plant's ability to become entangled with other trees and shrubs in shady areas. In the valley
ﬂoor, next to the Serpis river or in low or shady areas there would have
been riverbank formations with willows and/or poplars and elms. It
should be mentioned that 4 charred fragments of Olea europaea (wild
olive) were identiﬁed in unit Xa and 6 charred fragments of Ficus carica
(ﬁg tree) were recorded in unit Xb (AFA 1 and AFA 2). In the case of the
wild olive, this species is characteristic of warm Holocene contexts
(Costa et al., 2005). Radiocarbon dating of olive wood-charcoal fragments at Palaeolithic sites has always yielded a Holocene chronology
due to the percolation of fragments from more recent levels (Carrión
et al., 2010; Badal et al., 2012b). With regard to Ficus carica, it is not a
taxon that is frequently identiﬁed in Palaeolithic contexts of Western
Europe, although carpological evidence of its presence has been recorded (Martínez and Badal, 2018). Thus, due to the absence of more
data that support its presence in Palaeolithic period, we must be

certain diﬀerences can be identiﬁed in the rainfall pattern. Thus, the
greater percentages of Acer sp. and Buxus sempervirens in unit Xb, together with increasing Juniperus sp. values in units Xa and IX, indicate
that the climate would have been more humid in the oldest part of the
sequence (unit Xb), which coincides with microfaunal data recovered
from this unit (Fagoaga et al., 2017).

5.1.1. Current climatic requirements of the identiﬁed ﬂora
The dominant species in the plant record of El Salt are not currently
found in the study area but are characteristic of medium-high mountain
areas in supra-Mediterranean and oro-Mediterranean bioclimatic belts
(Ozenda, 1982; Rivas-Martinez, 1987). In order to discover the closest
region that currently has similar climatic conditions to those of the
Serpis valley during MIS 3, we have processed data on the current
spatial distribution of some of the identiﬁed taxa. By processing these
data in Quantum GIS we have been able to obtain diﬀerent overlapping
areas and to analyse whether there are any signiﬁcant changes in the
geographical distribution when species with speciﬁc altitude, humidity
and temperature requirements are added. In this regard, the carpological data have added signiﬁcant information to the palaeoecological
approach. The homogeneous anatomical structure of Juniperus means
that it cannot be identiﬁed at species level, so the identiﬁcation of Juniperus sabina (savin juniper) seeds makes it possible to conﬁrm that at
least this species was present, thus contributing highly detailed ecological information.
The overlapping areas generated result from selecting and/or
eliminating taxa identiﬁed in the archaeological record in order to
outline diﬀerent possible ecological scenarios (Table 3). Overlapping
area 1 has been obtained for Juniperus, Pinus nigra, Taxus baccata, Pistacia terebinthus and evergreen and deciduous Quercus species (Fig. 4a).

cautious in its interpretation.
The plant record from El Salt, based on the macrobotanical remains
recovered, is indicative of a local landscape characterised by predominantly supra-Mediterranean sub-humid conditions (MAT of
8–13 °C MAP of 600–1000 mm). The climatic parameters contrast with
those obtained for unit IV of Abric del Pastor, an earlier Middle
Palaeolithic site (MIS 4/5) located 4 km away from El Salt, which shows
predominantly semi-arid conditions consistent with a cooler and a more
xeric climate during the development of MIS 4 period (Vidal-Matutano
et al., 2015). Despite the fact that there is a great deal of homogeneity
in the anthracological sequence from unit Xb to unit VIII at El Salt,

However, the maps generated indicate the prevalence of supra-Mediterranean bioclimatic conditions that are consistent with the palaeoecological results of the analysis of macrobotanical remains. In fact, the
diﬀerent ecological scenarios generated show the Sierra de Javalambre
(Teruel) and the eastern Iberian System as the areas where the identiﬁed taxa are currently found. This mountainous region
(1000–1500 m a.s.l.) lies in the supra-Mediterranean and oro-Mediterranean bioclimatic belts, with a MAT of 8–10 °C and a MAP of
500–700 mm (Rivas-Martinez, 1987; Costa et al., 2005). According to
the macrobotanical data, these could have been the bioclimatic conditions in the Serpis valley region during the Middle Palaeolithic (Vidal-

area 3 includes the same taxa as overlapping area 2, but replacing Pinus
sylvestris with Pinus nigra (Fig. 4c). Finally, overlapping area 4 covers
the taxa included in overlapping area 2, but with the addition of
evergreen and deciduous Quercus (Fig. 4d). The spatial analysis of these
data has made it possible to detect small diﬀerences made by taxa with
higher or lower temperature and humidity requirements (e.g. the notable distribution of overlapping area 2 in the Pyrenees due to the
presence of boxwood, or the disappearance of points located at a higher
altitude with the inclusion of Quercus species in overlapping area 4).

Most of the carpological remains are charred, which is a basic
condition to infer their relationship with anthropic activities. The carbonisation of the seeds indicates that they were exposed to ﬁre either
intentionally (to be processed for eating or disposed of in the ﬁre) or
unintentionally (accompanying ﬁrewood). Two taxa (Rubus cf. laciniatus and Celtis australis) are only mineralised, which leads to the
question of whether their origin is anthropic. Some fruits, such as Celtis,
are known for having a high carbonate content in the pericarp, which
makes them resistant to decay (Cowan et al., 1997; Messager et al.,
2010; Shillito and Almond, 2010). This property of Celtis has been seen
as a reason for its abundance in some Pleistocene archaeological sites
(Lev et al., 2005; Messager et al., 2010; García Moreno et al., 2014;
Allué et al., 2015). However, as no charred remains of this fruit have
been recovered yet, its relationship with human activities could be
questioned, and it may be the result of modern contamination, percolation from Holocene levels at sites with an extensive sequence or introduction by birds (Sievers, 2006). Even so, it is noteworthy that
abundant fragments of mineralised Celtis pericarps were found in the
thin layers obtained from unaltered primary contexts of unit Xb (Mallol
et al., 2013b).
The charred materials that could have been used as food by
Neanderthal groups are maples seeds, legumes and juniper. Indeed, the
presence of legumes in contexts of hunter-gatherer groups is common
(Aura et al., 2005; Martínez and Badal, 2018) and they are a food resource found in Mediterranean forests. Juniperus and Acer are taxa that
have been used for human consumption (Rivera-Núñez and Obón-deCastro, 1991; Kuhnlein and Turner, 1991), but when they appear associated with wood charcoal fragments the question arises as to whether the fruits were accidentally harvested or not and whether they
were intended for human consumption.
Despite the fact that the carpological record is well preserved, the
Acer sp. seeds recovered in the area of combustion structure H57 show a
high degree of fragmentation (Fig. 2a). This hyper-fragmentation of the
macrobotanical remains is consistent with that observed in the

5.2. Palaeoeconomic data
5.2.1. Contribution of seed remains to the palaeoeconomic approach
Few seed remains were recovered at El Salt, although they provide
signiﬁcant information given the scarcity of known evidence of wild
seeds in hunter-gatherer contexts (Gale and Carruthers, 2000; Weiss
et al., 2004; Aura et al., 2005; Lev et al., 2005; Sievers, 2006; Weiss
et al., 2008; García Moreno et al., 2014; Allué et al., 2015; Snir et al.,
2015; Badal and Martínez, 2017; Martínez and Badal, 2018). The results presented here show the importance of performing a systematic
and exhaustive ﬂotation of the sediments to achieve optimum results
(Vidal-Matutano, 2016).

is why it was so highly valued in the past, as can be seen from its use in
numerous Mesolithic and Neolithic bows from Northern Europe
(Cattelain, 1997) or the yew tools recovered from the lakeside settlement of La Draga (Blanco et al., 2008). Recent evidence from Aranbaltza III (northern Iberia) point out to the presence of a Middle Palaeolithic wooden tool made of yew (Rios-Garaizar et al., 2018),
reinforcing the importance of this species for woodworking. The
charred yew fruit fragment from El Salt is a conﬁrmation of its presence
in the local environment, despite it was not being used for fuel. This
may be related to the possibility that Neanderthal groups protected this
tree in order to make use of it for other products: wood for tools, a
natural poison due to its high taxine content (Pérez-Díaz et al., 2013),
for medicinal uses (Cortés et al., 2000) or even as food (Rivera-Núñez
and Obón-de-Castro, 1991). These last options must be evaluated since
only one carpological remain is evidenced.
Finally, the observation of wood degradation patterns that occurred
prior to charring followed by their quantitative analysis according to
previous experimental studies revealed diﬀerences between the alteration degrees of the ﬁrewood used in the hearths, highlighting the
existence of ﬁrewood acquisition criteria based on dead wood gathering
by Neanderthal groups of Eastern Iberia and also suggesting smokerelated functions, e.g. the preservation of meat in view of a group migration, the treatment of hides, the repelling of mosquitoes or ﬂies,
among others (Vidal-Matutano et al., 2017a). In this regard, the recovery of 253 charred maple seed fragments within the ash layer of
combustion feature H57 at El Salt has provided signiﬁcant information
about the state of the wood that was chosen as fuel (dead, mostly degraded black-scots pine together with the collection of dead maple
branches at, at least, an incipient state of biodegradation). Furthermore,

anthracological assemblages of El Salt, where the overall distribution of
charcoal fragments ﬁts into two size categories: 2–4 mm and 1–2 mm
(Vidal-Matutano et al., 2017a). This may be related to exposure of the
remains to ﬁre and/or to the occupation dynamics of the shelter. In fact,
the conﬁguration of the stratigraphic sequence of El Salt as a dense
palimpsest of recurrent occupation events (Mallol et al., 2013a;
Machado and Pérez, 2016; Machado et al., 2016; Vidal-Matutano,
2017) could explain the fact that the macrobotanical remains are affected by mechanical processes of anthropic origin (trampling, reworking) in addition to natural processes (freezing/thawing or drying/
humidity cycles) (Théry-Parisot et al., 2010).
Bearing in mind that much of the carpological record consists of
taxa that are present in the anthracological assemblages from the site, it
is feasible that these remains could have been thrown into the ﬁre together with the fuel. However, there are certain considerations that are
worthy of attention. Firstly, both Rubus cf. laciniatus and Celtis australis
produce edible fruits that have traditionally been valued by human
societies (Pardo-de-Santayana et al., 2007). Nevertheless, their presence should be interpreted with caution, as these taxa are easily mineralised and are not charred. Signiﬁcant evidence comes from a
fragment of yew fruit, as the use of this taxon as fuel has not been noted
at any point in the sequence of El Salt (Vidal-Matutano, 2016). This
contrasts with the anthracological information from Abric del Pastor,
where few yew fragments were identiﬁed among the fuel used (VidalMatutano, 2015). The presence of this carpological remain only in unit
Xb of El Salt raises the question of plants being collected for uses other
than as fuel, e.g. the selection of woods with which to manufacture
implements or handles for tools. In fact, yew wood is very strong and
elastic, which makes it easy to work with (Uzquiano et al., 2015). This

and to the north it would be possible to reach part of the Sierra Mariola
and the Serpis valley in this period of time, as there are no signiﬁcant
slopes (Fig. 5). However, these landscape analysis models are based on
the current geomorphological features of a region, concealing the
orographic changes that have taken place since the Pleistocene. Given
that our intention is to deﬁne the optimal distribution of vegetation
based on the identiﬁed macrobotanical remains, we have chosen to use
two theoretical concentric circles relating to two levels of wood procurement (Fig. 6):
- Theoretical procurement within a radius of 1 km: the immediate
vicinity of the site based on ethnographic data that suggest that dead
wood is gathered within a radius of up to 1 km and green wood within a
distance of 50–70 m (Alix and Brewster, 2004; Henry et al., 2009;
Henry and Théry-Parisot, 2014). This distance from the site would
depend mainly on the availability of Pinus nigra-sylvestris and Acer sp.
wood in diﬀerent states, i.e. dead, rotting, green or healthy wood.
- Theoretical procurement within a radius of 5 km: an area that was
traditionally regarded as optimal for ﬁrewood gathering, equivalent to
the territory covered in 1 h (Butzer, 1982; Badal and Heinz, 1991).
Juniperus sabina would have been present in this area, predominantly
occupying the oro-Mediterranean bioclimatic belt, possibly together
with other species of the same genus (J. communis, J. thurifera). Some
species of Quercus would have been present in the region, with a greater
abundance of deciduous Quercus sp. in more humid areas. Finally, some
scantly represented taxa would have occupied riverside plant formations (ash, elm, willow, poplar) or valleys or shady areas (yew).
The analysis of ﬁrewood procurement, together with the hypothetical distribution of vegetation during MIS 3, reinforces the idea of the
strategic location of the settlement in a rock shelter with quick, easy
access to a variety of biotopes: supra-Mediterranean and oroMediterranean medium-high mountains, extensive plains in the Serpis

the presence of these carpological remains could provide clues to the
seasonal use of this hearth. According to the growth cycle of maple, the
occupation event related to combustion structure 57 may have taken
place during the autumn-winter period (Vidal-Matutano et al., 2017a).
This evidence is a good example of the need to interrelate the presence
of carpological and anthracological remains in order to obtain signiﬁcant information about the use and management of plants.
5.2.2. Plant resources management by Neanderthal groups
Site catchment analysis (SCA) has been widely used to assess the
interaction of human societies with the natural resources available in
their surroundings (Jarman et al., 1972; Roper, 1979; Hodder and
Orton, 1990). Despite the potential shown by this tool in the ﬁrst model
applied to catchment areas among hunter-gatherer groups in the area
around Monte Carmelo (Vita-Finzi and Higgs, 1970), few studies have
been published for Pleistocene contexts (Bailey and Davidson, 1983;
Marín Arroyo, 2008). In our case, it is a good analytical tool for estimating the extent to which the composition of the local landscape inﬂuenced planned wood gathering activities.
One of the proposed approaches for achieving a more accurate
calculation of catchment areas and distances from the site is to readjust
the theoretical area on the basis of the topography. Thus, the area is
delimited by isochrones or contour lines, making it possible to show the
theoretical walking hours according to Naismith's rule (Jarman et al.,
1972; Roper, 1979; Norman, 2004). In our case, the cumulative anisotropic cost of moving from El Salt to diﬀerent geographical locations
was calculated using a raster map containing simulated biogeographical
conditions for the MIS 3 period in the region of the Serpis valley (VidalMatutano and Pardo-Gordó, 2017). The cost map generated for El Salt
shows that it takes two walking hours to reach the theoretical distribution of the oro-Mediterranean bioclimatic belt (Font Roja's peak),

scarcity of dead wood.

valley and riverside plant formations. Availability, access and abundance of ﬁrewood in the local environment would certainly have been
decisive factors in choosing this location for the settlement. The
abundance of coniferous woods in the anthracological record contrasts
with the lower frequency of other plant formations that are found
further from the shelter, such as riverside vegetation. This lower proportion could be explained by the existence of suﬃcient dead pine and
maple wood in the immediate vicinity of the shelter, which would avoid
its inhabitants having to transport wood from greater distances. The
theoretical distance of 1 km around El Salt seems to suggest the existence of various biotopes that could provide the taxonomical diversity
seen in the macrobotanical analysis. Moreover, this radius of action is
consistent with the “Principle of least eﬀort” proposed by Shackleton

6. Conclusions
The data from the macrobotanical remains presented here have shed
new light on the environmental conditions in Eastern Iberia during MIS
3 and the use and management of ﬁrewood resources by Neanderthal
groups. Systematic ﬂotation of sediments at El Salt has proven to be an
eﬀective method for recovering charcoal and seed fragments. The anthracological data suggest that the local plant landscape was characterised by the dominance of sub-humid supra-Mediterranean

conditions (MAT 8–13 °C and MAP 600–1000 mm), similar to those
currently found in the Sierra de Javalambre (Teruel) and the eastern
Iberian system. Fuel gathering would have been a planned activity
carried out mainly in local procurement areas. Site catchment analysis
shows that wood collection activities could have been concentrated
within a small radius of 1 km, where the diﬀerent biotopes found in the
analysis of the macrobotanical remains would have been present. The
theoretical distance of 1 km around the shelter is deﬁned in relation to
the ethnographic observations that indicate this radius for the procurement of dead wood and a smaller distance for collecting green
wood. In this regard, previous anthracological studies carried out at El
Salt from a palaeoeconomic perspective have pointed to the preferential
use of dead wood by Neanderthal groups, a type of biomass that would
have been readily available in the immediate vicinity of the site. The
combination of anthracological and carpological analyses is fundamental, as it enables us to gain a better picture of the local climatic
conditions at that time (e.g. identiﬁcation of the species Juniperus sabina
thanks to the recovery of endocarps). Moreover, the recovery of fruits
from taxa that are absent in the anthracological record means that these
plants may have been used for other purposes, e.g. wood working or
food source (Taxus baccata). The application of systematic methods of
recovering macrobotanical remains in other Middle Palaeolithic contexts will help to provide more knowledge about the dynamics of the
local plant landscape and the way human groups interacted with plant
resources.
