Many of the key debates in archaeology hinge on the chronology and interpretation of data gathered
from cave and rockshelter stratigraphies, especially those in karstic limestone environments which are
selectively targeted by archaeologists because of their superior preservation characteristics. It has long
been recognized that such sites often contain a variety of cemented deposits including cave breccias and
that some breccias contain anthropogenic inclusions such as stone artefacts, shell and burnt animal
bones. Cementation enhances the survival through time of such brecciated deposits. This can result in
chrono-stratigraphic intervals surviving on cave walls and speleothems that are no longer represented in
the stratigraphy of cave ﬂoors. This has important implications for understanding apparent presence/
absence of human occupation and cultural continuity as seen in archaeo-stratigraphy in caves and
rockshelters, especially in relation to human migration in the humid tropics in SE Asia and the Paciﬁc,
and over Pleistocene to Holocene timescales. Here we discuss localized breccia formation, the erosional
processes that leave remnant deposits adhering to walls and speleothems at heights well above current
cave ﬂoors, and the possible signiﬁcance of local and regional processes, especially changing base levels,
in triggering gutting out phases impacting cave ﬂoor sediment architectures. Equally signiﬁcant in terms
of chronological completeness, representativeness and bias is the contribution made by cultural materials encased in older breccias as they erode and are (re-)incorporated into younger accumulating cultural deposits. Case studies from cave sites in Papua New Guinea and Timor Leste are used to illustrate
these issues.

1. Introduction
Breccias (poorly-sorted, cemented, angular clastic deposits) are
common in caves in the Asia Paciﬁc region. That such deposits can
form valuable archives for investigating biostratigraphic sequences
over long time spans has been recognized by paleontologists who
have used them to date and document faunal successions (e.g.
Westaway et al., 2007). Breccias are often also found in archaeological sites and can contain well preserved cultural materials.
However, the potential use of remnant breccia deposits as patch
archives of (otherwise missing) sequences of cave human occupation records has been largely neglected by archaeologists.

Breccias often form against cave walls or speleothem columns in
areas where carbonate-rich water ﬂows over, seeps into or drips
onto, the ﬂoor deposit of archaeological sites, causing sediments to
lithify in situ. Where breccias cement to the walls or cave features,
they frequently survive when laterally adjacent unconsolidated
sedimentary deposits erode away. From an archaeological
perspective this means that residual cave breccias containing cultural material may provide sequence archives for time periods
which are otherwise absent from the main body of cave inﬁll. This
makes such relict deposits valuable bio- and chrono-stratigraphic
archives especially where cultural evidence of past human occupation interstratiﬁes with other (often dateable) deposits which
archive other aspects of Quaternary regional palaeo-environmental
change. Such proxy environment-informative carbonate-cemented
deposits include speleothem, conglomerates, ﬂowstones, tufa and
calcretes (see Brook et al., 1999; Fairchild and Baker, 2012).

and anthropogenic charcoal commonly preserve exceptionally well
within such carbonate-cemented deposits in cave, cave-mouth, and
open site settings.
Cemented deposits containing cultural materials have long been
recognized as a feature of caves and rockshelters in limestone regions in many parts of the world. Such deposits are common in
limestone caves in the humid tropics where seasonal rainfall is
high, and water seeping through ﬁssures in the cave walls causes
the deposits in the caves to cement (e.g. Dominguez-Bella et al.,
2012; Mijares et al., 2010:124). These deposits present problems
for the ﬁne scale removal and extraction of cultural materials and
recent work has dealt with new methods for excavating such deposits (Dominguez-Bella et al., 2012). However the implications
cemented deposits have for interpretation of the archaeological
record have rarely been addressed in detail. Breccia deposits containing culturally-derived materials, preserved at heights above the
current site deposit surface, are often overlooked by archaeologists
who interpret discontinuities in the chrono-stratigraphic sequences from their excavations as reﬂecting phases of occupation
and abandonment by humans using the sites, rather than the result
of a diverse range of natural processes acting on the completeness
of stratigraphy within cave systems. Here we discuss the mechanisms that form such cemented deposits and the potential for
redeposition/incorporation of these remnant deposits into the
accumulating archaeological record. We argue that while such
deposits may bias the accumulating archaeological record, they also
provide useful ‘time capsules’ allowing the recognition that periods
of the human occupation record, as originally deposited, are
missing from the excavated archaeological record. In other words,
they allow us to recognize that our sample is biased and that the
missing time is not due to site or regional human abandonment.
The dating of these remnant ‘time capsule’ deposits is therefore
critical for understanding the history of human occupation in the
context of sediment accumulation and removal episodes.
1.1. Early studies of archaeological breccia deposits in the Indo
Paciﬁc region
Breccia deposits on cave walls, containing cultural materials,
were ﬁrst noted in Island Southeast Asia by Van Heekeren whilst he
was exploring cave sites on the island of Sulawesi in 1949e50. He
reported that Burung cave in the Lealleang valley of the Maros region contained lenses of shells, bones and stone artefacts which
were attached to the walls at heights of up to 1.5 m above the ﬂoor
of the cave, and hypothesized correctly that these were formed as a
result of carbonate-rich waters cementing the cultural material
(Van Heekeren, 1972:123). A detailed assessment of breccia deposits in the same region was later made by Ian Glover (1979)
during the course of his archaeological research in Sulawesi. He
noted remnant deposits of breccia at Leang Burung 2 (Van Heekeren’s Burung Cave), Ulu Leang, Leang Timpusang and Leang
Pattae (Glover, 1979:307). At Ulu Leang breccias were found in at
least 30 places around the walls, and Glover records that:
“Nearer the front of the cave, smaller patches of cemented deposit remained on the walls high above the present ﬂoor, where
they seemed to reﬂect an earlier ﬂoor level sloping towards the
front of the cave and between 1 and 2 m above the existing cave
ﬂoor … The presence of bone fragments among the cemented
shells, and occasional chert ﬂakes was convincing proof that this
was not a natural deposit, but habitational refuse.” (Glover,
1979:307)
Glover (1979) attempted to understand the processes that
resulted in the formation of such deposits, and how they came to be

cemented so high above the current surface of the deposit. He
initially hypothesized that they were the “truncated remains of an
older cave ﬁll eroded by water action and largely removed before
the current cave deposits began to accumulate.” Following on from
this he excavated and dated one of the breccia deposits at Ulu Leang
and conﬁrmed that it contained a similar range of cultural material,
and was of the same age as surface layers elsewhere in the cave,
leading him to reject his earlier hypothesis that the breccias represented a remnant deposit from a Pleistocene or signiﬁcantly
earlier depositional episode. Instead he hypothesized that the
breccias were all that remained after the underlying habitation
deposits were dissolved “though solution and mechanical removal”
thus undermining the cave ﬂoor. As deposit was lost from below,
this would cause the cave ﬂoor to subside over time, leaving only
patches of deposit cemented to walls or speleothems at heights
above the current ﬂoor to attest to its prior ﬁll level.
Here we re-evaluate Glover’s hypotheses regarding the mechanisms for breccia formation and deposit loss, and look at their
general applicability to other caves based on the dating of breccias
and cultural sequences from two limestone caves in Timor Leste
and one in Papua New Guinea [PNG] (Fig. 1). We identify a diverse
array of mechanisms to account for the presence of cave breccias on
walls and speleothems well above the current ﬂoor ﬁll level, and
suggest that these can only be understood by dating and analysis of
individual cave systems and a range of deposits within a given cave.
All three sites are located in high rainfall areas with marked seasonality in the humid tropics.
2. Case studies from Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Timor
Leste
2.1. Lachitu Cave (PNG)
2.1.1. Site location, environmental context and excavation
Lachitu Cave is on the north coast of PNG (S 2.633888, E
141.136388) in karstic limestone terrain at the foot of the Oenake
Range, between the coast and the Bewani-Torricelli mountain chain
(Klootwijk et al., 2003). The area is tectonically active with net uplift
rates >1.2 m/1000 years and likely movement associated with
Holocene seismic events (see Tudhope et al., 2000). Today Lachitu is
about 22e24 m above sea level and faces north to the shoreline ca.
150 m from the cave entrance (Fig. 1). A steep scree slope immediately below the mouth of the cave might be a product of recent
cliff line retreat and roof collapse, perhaps during the 7000 cal BP
marine relative high stand.
Lachitu was excavated by Paul Gorecki and colleagues from
James Cook University in 1990/1991, and again by the authors in
2004/2005. The deposit can be divided into a thin upper unit with
pottery, sparse bone, shell and stone artefacts, and a pre-ceramic
unit comprising the majority of the deposit (Gorecki et al., 1991;
O’Connor et al., 2010). Stone artefacts are abundant in the preceramic unit and along with a diverse range of marine and terrestrial fauna are found to the base of the deposit. Gorecki et al. (1991)
reported on one excavation Square, X1, which had a lower unit with
a Pleistocene age of 17,399e16,389 cal BP (ANU-7603) and an upper
Holocene unit (Table 1). They noted that the dates they obtained
suggested several phases of non-occupation or cultural hiatus.
Together with unpublished samples submitted from the 1991 season from excavation Square Y1 their results suggest a hiatus between ~14,000 and ~9500 cal BP, ~9500 and 6500 cal BP and ~6500
and 700 cal BP (Gorecki et al., 1991:121) (Table 1). A later publication reported a date of 42,412e36,507 cal BP (ANU-7610), for a
shell sample from 130e140 cm below the surface (Gorecki,
1993:155). Gorecki (1993) does not discuss the provenance or
context of this much older sample, but the depth information on

obtained from the ANU Radiocarbon Laboratory with the permission of Paul Gorecki. Dates are calibrated in Oxcal 4.2, using SHCal13
(Hogg et al., 2013) for charcoal samples, and Marine13 (Reimer
et al., 2013) for marine shell samples. No DeltaR correction is
applied for the marine shell calibrations as the ANU radiocarbon
submission forms identify it only as marine shell and the table in
Gorecki et al. (1991) as ‘shell’. No d13C is reported in Gorecki et al.
(1991). Note the radiocarbon ages differ from those reported in
Gorecki et al. (1991:121) which includes only the dates from Square
X1 and which had a reservoir correction of 400 years deducted
from the radiocarbon ages, and were uncalibrated.
In 2004/2005 the authors returned to Lachitu to try to replicate
the 42,412e36,507 cal BP (ANU-7610) date and to clarify the
provenance of the sample. Three test pits (Squares A, B and C) were
excavated, each of 1 m2, to a point where large rubble or bedrock

hindered further removal (Fig. 2). Only Squares A and C have thus
far been dated. The dates and cultural ﬁnds from the excavation
have been reported elsewhere (O’Connor et al., 2011). Here we
focus on some of the apparent dating anomalies, inversions and
chrono-stratigraphic hiatuses revealed by our 2004/2005 excavations and discuss these and Gorecki’s earlier results within the
context of geomorphic processes acting on the cave sedimentary
deposits.
2.1.2. Lachitu: the chrono-stratigraphic sequence
In brief, our 2004/2005 excavation sequences largely supported
Gorecki et al.’s (1991) ﬁndings. Squares A and C had similar stratigraphic proﬁles (Fig. 4). The upper 20 cm in Square A, Excavation
Units (EUs) 1e4, is a visibly active soil layer, with evidence of
mixing by invertebrates and burrowing by land crabs. It consists of
ﬁne sandy grits or sandy calcareous earths, was less clastic than the
lower levels, and had discrete sandy-silty lenses. Ashy layers,
interpreted as the remains of hearths, occur within shallow depressions lying unconformably over lower shelly units. There is

little or no evidence for net sediment accumulation in Square A
between the shell rich deposit dated earlier than 6000 cal BP and
the upper deposit dating to the historic period. The cultural
assemblage at the interface, the upper excavation units of the shell
rich deposit (EUs 5e7), is clearly a mixed-age palimpsest including
mid Holocene-aged marine shells and pottery and pig teeth which
are dated to within the last few thousand years (O’Connor et al.,
2010).
The deposit underlying the mid Holocene unit shows episodic
accumulation between ~6000 and 18,000 cal BP, has more shell and
dense shelly lenses, and more rock and clastic aggregates. No
samples dating as early as the 42,412e36,507 cal BP (ANU-7610)
basal date obtained by Gorecki were recovered during the 2004/
2005 excavations (O’Connor et al., 2010). However, two age estimates were obtained which were signiﬁcantly older (and present
an inversion) compared with all other dated samples in the
sequence;

BP
(Wk-16528)
and
28,145e27,555 cal BP (Wk-16527), although no stratigraphic

anomaly was evident in plan or section (Table 2, Fig. 4). These early
dates alert us to the possibility of a much longer history of occupation at Lachitu, as well as the probability of several major
erosional episodes prior to that which occurred subsequent to
~6500 cal BP. Whether any remnants of these earlier deposits
remain in situ is currently unknown.

2.1.3. The Lachitu breccias
One factor noted during the 2004 excavation whose import was
not immediately recognized was that many excavation units contained aggregates of marine shell, bone, and limestone rubble in
cemented clasts (O’Connor et al., 2010). At the time, these were
thought to result from in situ cementation of the deposit due to the
passage of water, rich in calcium carbonate, through the deposit reprecipitating around rock fragments and cultural materials. What
was not clear was why this process acted differentially e with some
cultural materials appearing heavily cemented, while other ﬁnds
from the same excavation unit and depth below surface were

entirely unaffected. However it was not until the second excavation
season in 2005 that perched breccia deposits were discovered by
one of the authors (KA) adhering to the lower part of a speleothem
near the entrance of the cave (Fig. 2). Signiﬁcantly the perched
breccia contained cultural material and the speleothem was heavily
eroded at the base (Fig. 2). Two marine shells (Turbo marmoratus)
from within this breccia produced dates of ~18,200 cal BP (Wk17978 and Wk-17979). Cemented cultural deposits were subsequently identiﬁed in other locations within the cave. A Turbo sp.
shell from an eroding breccia 30 cm above the current cave ﬂoor
and behind Square B dated to ~7200 cal BP (OZF-282) (Fig. 2,
Table 2).
Acetic acid treatment of the breccia clasts from within the

deposit produced cultural assemblages of broken, burnt and unburnt marine shell and animal bones, as well as charcoal and stone
artefacts, which were indistinguishable in terms of content to that
in the unlithiﬁed sedimentary units. In the areas where breccia was
actively eroding from the base of the speleothems detached clasts
could be seen on the cave ﬂoor, indicating that fretting of the older
cemented cultural deposits is an ongoing process, and this older
cultural material is being actively re-deposited. Re-deposition and
incorporation of older archaeological materials into the deposit as it
has accumulated has clearly biased the archaeological record.
In short, dates on material from cemented breccias, as well as
eroded and secondarily re-deposited clasts of breccia containing
cultural materials found in the deposits, alert us to the likelihood

that the ‘missing time’ at Lachitu is due to major phases of erosion
and sediment loss, rather than a lack of human occupation.
2.2. Timor Leste, Lene Hara Cave
In Timor Leste perched breccia deposits have been identiﬁed in
many limestone caves and shelters (pers. obs). Here we focus on
deposits in two sites which have been excavated, Lene Hara and
Laili.
2.2.1. Site location, environmental context and excavation
Lene Hara (S 8.408809, E 127.292700) is a large limestone solution cave at the extreme eastern tip of Timor Leste (Fig. 1). It is
situated at ca.100 m above sea level in an uplifted coral terrace, less
than 1 km from the current shoreline. The cave entrance faces east,
with a well-developed drip-line overhanging a vegetated terrace at
the front of the cave. The drip-line area at the entrance is over 40 m
wide, and the main cave extends more than 50 m into the hillside
before entering narrow ﬁssure systems (Fig. 5). Under the drip-line,
large mounded areas of block fall, comprising both limestone and
fallen speleothem, form 2e5 m high piles of block debris (Fig. 5).
Isolated speleothems occur within the interior of the cave as 2e4 m
wide columns and 1e2 m high mounds (Fig. 6). Many of the speleothems have elevated eroded pedestals, where past erosion
events have removed unconsolidated sediments from around the
base of the columns and caused net lowering of the cave ﬂoor
abutting these structures (O’Connor et al., 2010).
The current ﬂoor of Lene Hara Cave is highest in the south (near
Square A) and slopes away to the north and northeast (Fig. 5).
Surﬁcial cave ﬂoor sediment is generally a loose organic cave earth,
composed of ﬁne sands to silt. High areas around the speleothem
columns serve to channel episodic surface water ﬂow from ﬁssures
at the rear of the cave during extreme storm events. Surface water
ﬂow has produced micro-fans and ﬁne gravel lags by winnowing
away ﬁnes. This has caused some exposure of ﬂowstones on the
surface (Fig. 5). Recent sedimentation within the cave has been
further complicated by the construction of linear stone walls of
boulder rock fall. In places in situ speleothem columns are incorporated into the constructed wall of limestone blocks. The central
outer mounded rampart area of rock fall and, further inside, the
large speleothem column, effectively separate the mouth of the

cave into two chambers (Fig. 6). To date four 1 m2 test pits, Squares
A, B, D and F have been excavated in Lene Hara. The results show
that different chrono-stratigraphic sequences are preserved in
different areas of the cave.
2.2.2. Lene Hara: the chrono-stratigraphic sequence
Square A, excavated in 2000 in the higher southern part of the
cave produced an 80 cm deep sequence that predominantly dated
between ~39,000 and 34,000 cal BP (Table 3). Square A can be
broadly divided into an upper and lower deposit. The upper and
lower deposits are further divisible into four litho-stratigraphic
units (LUIeLUIV) (Fig. 7). The upper deposit (LUI) is unconsolidated and consists of dark brown well sorted sandy silts, with near
horizontal bedding. This unit conformably overlies the slightly
undulating surface of LUII, comprised of denser and more organic
darker brown sandy silts. The well-deﬁned hearth feature in this
unit suggests minimal bioturbation (Fig. 7). LUIII has coarse to ﬁne
sandy silts, mixed with variable proportions of coarser gravels and
shell. The lower deposits, LUIV are much coarser, poorly sorted
sediments, ranging from gravelly silty sands to very coarse clastsupported cobble gravels and boulder rubble (see Fig. 7). The deposits become progressively more lithiﬁed below 60 cm, where
roof fall and cultural material are variably cemented to the base of
the test pit.
Eight radiocarbon dates obtained from the 2000 excavation
indicated that most of the marine shell within the sampled
sequence was of Pleistocene age, dating between 40,266 and
36,971 cal BP (ANU-11418) and 34,485e33,258 cal BP (ANU-11398)
(Table 3). A single sample of Tectus sp. cf. niloticus shell from EU 2
(5e10 cm depth) produced a late Holocene age of 691e508 cal BP
(ANU-11400). This suggested either that occupation of the cave was
discontinuous or spatially uneven, or that substantial erosion of the
deposit had occurred, creating a major chrono-stratigraphic hiatus.
Most pottery occurred in the top 25 cm of the deposit dating to the
Holocene, along with stone artefacts, marine shell and animal bone.
Occasional sherds found in the deposit dated to the Pleistocene
indicate some intermixing. Stone artefacts, marine shell and bones
continue to bedrock (O’Connor and Aplin, 2007). In our initial
publication we suggested that the cave was occupied between
35,000 and 30,000 and abandoned thereafter until the late Holocene (O’Connor et al., 2002a). Subsequently a program of direct

dating of artefacts from Square A produced two shell beads in EUs 7
and 10 dating to the mid to late Holocene, 4705e4415 cal BP (OZF212) and 3628e3404 cal BP (OZF-213) (O’Connor et al., 2002b:19).
This demonstrated that the cave had been used during the midHolocene and that some Holocene-aged cultural materials were
intermixed with Pleistocene-aged materials in the predominantly
late Pleistocene sediments of Square A.
In 2002 new excavations were carried out at Lene Hara. The
three 1 m2 test pits, Squares B, D and F were excavated to compare
the litho- and chrono-stratigraphy in other parts of the cave ﬂoor
with Square A. Square B was located in the same southern higher
area of the cave as Square A. Two other Squares, D and F, were
located in the lower, northern chamber outside the walled part of
the deposit (Fig. 5). Squares A, B and F were found to have little
overlap in terms of the chronology of the occupation phases represented. However it was the discovery of a signiﬁcant breccia
deposit containing cultural materials in 2009, adhering to a large

broken speleothem column, which radically revised our
interpretation.
Square B is ca. 60 cm deep with a stratigraphic sequence broadly
similar to Square A. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the sediments in B largely accumulated between ~30,000 and 21,000 cal BP
(Table 3), again with a thin upper veneer of late Holocene age. The
cultural sequence in Square B also mirrors that of Square A, with
pottery found in the top 20 cm of the deposit and bone, marine
shell and stone artefacts recovered throughout. The loose, surﬁcial
sediments occur in the upper 0e6 cm of the deposit and are wellsorted ﬁne sands and silts, with some ﬁne gravel (Fig. 8). This upper
unit is interpreted as a recent wash accumulation and overlies
denser deposits on a largely planar contact. Underlying deposits
comprise weakly-bedded coarse sandy silts with frequent larger
boulders and cobbles. These coarser gravelly earths in turn overlie
horizontally-bedded, ﬁner deposits. The deposit becomes courser
with depth and lowest sediments comprise partly cemented light

brown silty gravels, inﬁlling an undulating surface over ﬂowstone,
breccia and/or bedrock.
Squares D and F were located 1 m apart in the northern chamber
of the cave (Fig. 5). They are much closer to the drip-line, and within
a well-deﬁned, 5e8 m wide area of ﬂoor that experiences surface

wash from smaller rivulets originating in various clefts at the rear of
the cave. Excavation of Square D was discontinued at the wish of
the traditional owners at ca. 70 cm when a human burial was
encountered (Fig. 8). The date of 3745e3377 cal BP (ANU-12060)
from the lowest excavated EU (20) provides a maximum age for the

burial (Table 3).
Square F was excavated to a depth of ca. 220 cm where excavation was discontinued prior to reaching bedrock owing to safety
concerns (Fig. 9). The surﬁcial sediments in F are sandy silts, with
patches of ﬁne gravels. Weakly-bedded sands with variable gravel
and silt content form a well-deﬁned unit down to 70 cm. At this
level a distinct thin bed of light grey ashy sands and silts form a
continuous band across the Square. From 70 cm to 220 cm the
deposit comprises a moderately to well-stratiﬁed ﬁning upwards
sequence of ﬁne sandy gravels and sandy silts, variably interstratiﬁed and mixed with medium and coarse gravels. Cycles of
deposition are evident in the bedding structures and the age-depth
intervals of radiocarbon ages in the vertical sequence. Brief episodes of erosional surface wash and winnowing across the cave
ﬂoor are interspersed with deposition through creep, roof fall and
human discard. The lowest 50e60 cm of the Square F deposit was
signiﬁcantly coarser than the overlying deposit (Fig. 9).

Radiocarbon dates from Square F demonstrate that the entire
sequence is of Holocene age, dating between 11,209 and 10,791 cal
BP (ANU-12040) at the base and 1146e444 cal BP (ANU-12140)
close to the surface in EU 5 (Fig. 9).
The broad stratigraphic sequence observed across the four test
pits in Lene Hara Cave is interpreted as follows. In the southern,
higher parts of the cave sampled by Squares A and B, early rock fall
debris formed platforms against the walls. These areas were
occupied in the late Pleistocene, probably starting around
39,000 cal BP, and signiﬁcant rapid inﬁlling of natural hollows with
midden refuse resulted. Sediment and cultural debris continued in
this area of the cave for at least 5000 years. Sometime prior to
30,000 years ago, the adjacent area sampled by Square B was
probably scoured to bedrock, followed by inﬁlling with coarse
sediment mixed with clastic roof fall and cultural material from
30,885e28,330 cal BP (ANU-12142), through to 23,133e21,156 cal
BP (ANU-12138). Scouring action evidently truncated the deposit

on at least one more occasion in the area of Square B, such that
nothing survives apart from a thin veneer of Holocene wash deposits unconformably capping the truncated sequence. The same
Holocene veneer probably caps the sedimentary sequence in the
area of Square A, but without an obvious unconformity. Further
evidence that ancient erosional episodes have removed signiﬁcant
volumes of sediment in this part of the site is found around the base
of the larger speleothems in the southern chamber of the cave,
where the elevated brecciated units signify a formerly higher cave
ﬂoor level.
2.2.3. The Lene Hara breccias
In September 2009 two of the authors (SOC, KA) returned to
Lene Hara Cave. The survey resulted in the discovery of a breccia
with inclusions of cultural materials such as marine shell, stone
artefacts and bone, cemented underneath the large speleothem
located between the southern and northern chambers of the cave
(Fig. 5). In the area sampled the breccia was approximately 50 cm
higher than the current ﬂoor surface in this part of the cave and
itself supports the speleothem column. Cultural material extracted
in situ from the breccia included a ﬂake made on red chert and
marine shellﬁsh. Two well preserved marine gastropods (Tectus sp.)
produced radiocarbon ages of between ~43,000 BP and ~41,000 BP
(Wk-26404, Wk-26405) (Table 4, samples 1 and 2).
In 2009 it was also noted that marine shells cemented in carbonate clasts could be found on the washed surface on the cave
ﬂoor. These included a high proportion of the marine gastropod
Nerita textilis. This species is common in the breccias on the
sampled speleothem and is one of the dominant species in the
Pleistocene shell assemblages at Lene Hara, but is much less
abundant in the Holocene archaeological layers. Formerly the
deﬁned range for this species was thought not to extend east of
India but recent collecting has identiﬁed it in Flores Island and
Maluku although population sizes are apparently very small
, 2004:10). One carbonate encrusted shell of
(Eichhorst and Szabo
Nerita textilis from the SW corner of EU 4 Square F was submitted
for dating and returned an age of 44,182e42,269 cal BP (S-ANU42729) (Table 4, sample Square F4). Based on the age, this specimen
is interpreted as eroded from older breccias, and then transported
into the lower northern area of the cave ﬂoor where it was subsequently incorporated into the accumulating deposit, illustrating a
process which has likely operated throughout the human occupation period. The Pleistocene date makes it difﬁcult to ascertain
whether Timor Leste is within the current range of the species.
2.3. Laili Cave, Timor Leste
2.3.1. Site location, environmental context and excavation
Laili is a large cave in a karstic limestone outcrop approximately
5 km inland of the north coast of Timor Leste (S 08.54048, E
126.16405), and within the modern village of Laleia (Fig. 1). Located
on a ridgeline ~86 m above sea level, the cave overlooks the Laleia
River braidplain about 350 m to the east.
Two 1 m2 test pits, Square A and B, were excavated at Laili in
2011 (Fig. 10). Square A positioned closer to the rear wall of the cave
was excavated to a depth of about 220 cm where large rocks
covered most of the Square in plan. Square B was excavated to a
depth of about 80 cm and discontinued when the deposit was
found to be disturbed by termite activity, and no analysis has been
carried out on Square B. Square A stratigraphic layers were rich in
stone artefacts and contained marine and terrestrial fauna, shellﬁsh
from the freshwater reaches of the river as well as the more distant
sea, and small quantities of urchin and crustacean. Dating of Square
A shows that Laili was ﬁrst occupied ~44,000 BP. Surprisingly,
however, the upper part of the deposit was found to date to ~10,000

153

BP, with merely a thin sedimentary lens of unconsolidated silty
sand, goat dung and leaf litter, with occasional shells and earthenware sherds, mantling the early Holocene/terminal Pleistocene
deposits (Fig. 11). The chrono-stratigraphic sequence in Square A at
Laili records no use of the cave between Modern and ~10,000 cal BP
(Fig. 11).
2.3.2. Laili: the chrono-stratigraphic sequence
A total of 40 excavation units (average ¼ 4.93 cm,
range ¼ 2.2e8 cm) were removed in Square A. Nineteen samples
from the deposit have been dated; most are charcoal samples
collected during excavation or from the sections at the completion
of the excavation (Fig. 11; Table 4). An additional ten breccia samples containing shell, bone and stone artefacts were removed from
the back wall of the cave above the current ﬂoor (Table 4 provides
the heights of the samples above datum). The deposit has been
divided into eleven Stratigraphic Units (1e11), based on sediment
texture, colour and sorting. The relationship between the stratigraphic units and the excavation units is shown in Fig. 11. The
stratigraphic units are described with reference to the radiocarbon
dates.
Unit 1 is comprised of loosely compacted ﬁne sands and silt. This
unit is rich in humic material and dung as goats are sometimes
penned inside the overhang. A radiocarbon date on charcoal from
one of the lowest lenses in Unit 1 returned a Modern age (D-AMS007343) (Fig. 11). Unit 2 is a poorly sorted coarse silty sand (10YR 6/
2). Radiocarbon samples from the west section for Unit 2 produced
ages of 10,992e10,650 cal BP (D-AMS 007342), and
12,362e11,764 cal BP (D-AMS 001654) indicating that these units
formed in the terminal Pleistocene to early Holocene.
Stratigraphic Units 3, 4 and 5 are similar in texture and sorting,
and have overlapping radiocarbon ages, possibly representing a
continuous phase of occupation and deposition. Unit 3 gets progressively ﬁner down the proﬁle, changing from coarse silty sand at
the boundary of Unit 2 and 3 to ﬁne sandy silt, rich in charcoal and
ash at the boundary of Unit 3 and 4. An in situ charcoal sample from
Unit 3 produced a date of 15,366e14,988 cal BP (D-AMS 001649).
Stratigraphic Unit 4 is also ﬁne sandy silt and extremely rich in
charcoal and comminuted ash. Bioturbation was observed in the
form of small roots and a burrow-like feature in the east wall. A
hearth (4a) occurs between EU 8 and 9. Charcoal from the west
section below hearth 4a dated to 16,115e15,755 cal BP (D-AMS
001655). Charcoal from the base of Stratigraphic Unit 4 was dated
to 16,104e15,714 cal BP (D-AMS 001656). Concentrations of charcoal and ash were found across the lower part of Unit 5, including a
hearth in the west wall (5a). Charcoal from the EU overlying the
hearth (EU 16) dated to 16,401e15,958 cal BP (D-AMS 001650).
Charcoal from hearth 5a returned an age of 17,468e17,038 cal BP
(D-AMS 001661). Stratigraphic Units 6 and 7 are coarse silty sand. A
charcoal sample from the west section of Unit 6 was dated to
16,298e15,902 cal BP (D-AMS 001657). Stratigraphic Unit 7 is
similar texturally but with more inclusions of rock. Five radiocarbon dates were obtained from Unit 7 (Table 4), ranging between
ca. 18,600e22,000 cal BP.
Stratigraphic Units 8e11 show progressive ﬁning down the
proﬁle. A charcoal sample collected from this Unit 8 during excavation has an age range of 38,258e36,831 cal BP (D-AMS 001652).
Unit 9 is sandy silt. Two charcoal samples were collected from the
west section within Unit 9, the ﬁrst returned an age of
12,409e11,828 cal BP (D-AMS 001663), a notable inversion, and the
second, 18,975e18,540 cal BP (D-AMS 001660), which is also
considerably younger that the date from Unit 8. An additional
charcoal sample from Unit 9, from the sieved fraction of EU 31, was
dated to 27,856e27,530 cal BP (D-AMS 001653). A hearth feature
(9a) occurs near the base of Stratigraphic Unit 9. Stratigraphic Unit

10 is texturally similar to 9, but has abundant ash and charcoal. A
strong boundary separates units 10 and 11. The sediment in Stratigraphic Unit 11 changes sharply to a pale brown ﬁne silt. While this
unit had sparse cultural material, a prominent hearth feature occurs in the west wall between EUs 34 and 36 (11a) dated to
44,631e43,283 cal BP (D-AMS007344).

2.3.3. The Laili wall breccias
When Laili cave was ﬁrst located in 2010 it was noted that there
were pockets of breccia containing cultural materials such as stone
artefacts, charcoal and shell adhering to areas of the rear wall of the
cave. Two samples were removed (1 2010 and 2 2010) and Terebralia palustris shells encased in them were dated to ~ 6500 BP (Wk28438 and Wk-28439) (Table 4). During excavation in 2011 an
additional 8 breccia samples from the cave rear wall were recorded
with height datums and subsequently shell and charcoal from six of
these was dated (Table 4).
The Laili breccias cover the time that is ‘missing’ from the cave
ﬂoor occupation deposit e the Holocene. The dates and heights
above current ﬂoor of these samples are shown in Table 4. The
remnant breccias on the walls at Laili tell us that the cave originally
contained a deep Holocene stratigraphy deposited between at least
1900 and 8500 cal BP, comprising stone artefacts, charcoal, shell
and animal bones in a ﬁne sediment matrix. In the breccia samples
processed for dating the edible mangrove gastropod Terebralia sp.
was the dominant shell species. Only one specimen of the freshwater species Stenomelania sp. was recovered, as well as some small
fragments of terrestrial snail. In terms of shell composition the
Holocene breccias closely match the deposit dated to the terminal
Pleistocene (EUs 1e5) which is also dominated by Terebralia sp.

Although our occupation dates at Laili are derived from a
1 m2  2.2 m sample of the deposit, the perched breccias sampled
from heights above the current ﬂoor, spread across an extensive
area of the rear wall of the cave all date to the Holocene. This would
suggest that deposit has been lost over a large area of the cave ﬂoor.
Establishing the extent of removal would require much more
intensive sampling and dating of the occupation deposit and the
breccias. It is possible that Holocene deposits may still be intact in
the higher western part of the cave ﬂoor (Fig. 10).
Laili Cave is located over 4 km from the coast. It seems inconceivable that sea level rise, and processes of coastal trimming and
readjustment hypothesized as possibly destabilizing the talus in
front of Lachitu and leading to deposit loss, would have effected
Laili. Voids relating to post-depositional animal activity like burrowing, and tree roots, are evident and such processes may cause
local subsidence, but this is unlikely to be uniform across the ﬂoor
of the cave, or to result in the level of deposit loss seen at Laili.
Processes leading to local subsidence or slumping would also presumably be evident in deformation of the stratigraphy. Excavation
of Squares A and B did not reveal any major post-depositional
subsidence although the stratigraphy in these test pits did provide evidence of some burrowing by small animals (probably rats),
root and burrow ﬁll features as well as extensive termite activity in
Square B. Generally the stratigraphy at Laili is horizontally bedded
and the fact that discrete hearths with ash and charcoal lenses are
evident in the section of A suggests minimal bioturbation.
Dissolution of organics in the lower basal deposits, as hypothesized by Glover (1979) could produce deposit slumping, however,
in this case the radiocarbon dates for the cemented raised remnant

breccia deposits should be replicated by dates in the upper part of
the deposit, as was the case in Leang Burung (Glover, 1979). Water
erosion within the cave could remove signiﬁcant quantities of
sediment however it is unlikely that this process would be uniform
across ﬂoor as suggested by the spread of breccia.

3. Discussion
As with all caves in tropical regions the processes acting on the
sedimentary deposits are complicated (Gillieson, 1996). The
completeness, or not, of the stratigraphic record within individual
caves typically reﬂects lateral shifts in facies deposition over a few

156

metres (Farrand, 2001). In the humid tropics pulsed and sudden
shifts in hydrological inputs drive alteration of sediment pathways
in caves and often initiate sudden threshold switching from inﬁlling of localized depocentres to phases of gutting out and sediment
re-deposition (Farrand, 2001; Gillieson, 1986; Osborne, 2008). The
complex nature of sedimentary deposits in limestone caves in the
humid tropics has been recognized and broadly discussed in reports on the Niah Caves, Sarawak (Barker et al., 2005:4; Gilbertson
et al., 2005), caves in the Maros region of Sulawesi (Glover, 1979),
and elsewhere in Southeast Asia (Anderson, 1997). Such complex
deposits pose major challenges for interpretation of the archaeological record.
The three sites discussed above in PNG and Timor Leste are
located in tectonically active areas of net coastal uplift, and are
associated with small coastal catchments, or narrow coastal margins and/or with uplifted coral reef terraces. At each site excavation
squares sample depositional sequences within the cave and most of
the excavation squares are within 5e20 m of the drip-line. Areas
close to the drip-line and cave mouth are renowned for stratigraphic complexity and interstratiﬁcation driven by hydrological
outputs and weathering of the host-rock, quasi-stochastic block
inputs derived from structural failures, and high inputs of deposits
produced from human and animal activities (Fairchild and Baker,
2012:69; Woodward and Goldberg, 2001).
At these sites there is little evidence of direct geomorphological
coupling between breccia formation and the broader landscape
hydrology or major zones of sediment storage suggesting localized
breccia forming processes. Breccia formation at each of these sites
takes place variably from the back to the mouth of the cave, under
overhangs and at the bedrock margins of the cave ﬂoor. Water
seepage reﬂects seasonal patterns of local hydrology of slopes and
the host rock. Each site is perched on slopes either separated from
the main valley ﬂoor (Laili), or upslope of the active shoreline on
strongly structurally controlled karstic slopes where gradients are

partly inherited from the morphology of palaeo-reefal shoreline
and uplifted coral terraces (Lachitu and Lene Hara).
Major phases of breccia formation in caves at valley ﬂoodplain
margins, linked to alluvial-karst local base-level hydrology, were
identiﬁed by Glover (1979). Duringer et al. (2012) link breccia formation at regional scales to net drop of alluvial plain elevations at
sites in tower karst of Laos and Vietnam. The timing of breccia
formation at some sites in north-east Laos is predicated on
changing sediment storage in valley ﬂoors and reversals of drainage
into and out of ﬂoodplain marginal caves producing polyphasic
cemented sequences of sandstones and conglomerates capped by
breccias.
Such regional geomorphological processes and diagnostic
sediment facies shifts do not apply to the case studies presented
here. Breccia formation, and the capacity of breccias to act as patch
stores of chrono-stratigraphy not present in the adjacent cave ﬂoor
is highly localized at our sites in Timor Leste and PNG. More
importantly, the bio-stratigraphic and cultural materials contained
in the breccias are well-stratiﬁed with autochthonous ashy layers
and food refuse, contain both fragile and robust skeletal materials,
and not uncommonly preserve articulated skeletal elements, artefacts which conjoin or other indicators of minimal reworking. As
such, these breccias are taphonomically and chronostratigraphically dissimilar from bone beds accumulated through
multiple phases of deposition and reworking (Bacon et al., 2004,
2008; Duringer et al., 2012), and show much higher stratigraphic
integrity and temporal resolution.
Our re-excavation of Lachitu and dating of marine shell in
perched cemented breccias attached to the speleothem columns
and cemented clasts from within the deposit containing cultural
materials, alert us to the likelihood that ‘missing time’ at Lachitu is
due to major phases of erosion and sediment loss, rather than a lack
of
human
occupation.

represents an in situ brecciated unit separated by an erosional hiatus from the terminal Pleistocene/Last Glacial Maximum deposits
dated to ~18,000 cal BP evident in both Gorecki’s and the 2004/
2005 excavations, and in the two dated breccias C and D (Wk-17978
and Wk-17979). The marine shells dated to ~28,000 cal BP from EUs
18 and 20 in Square A (Table 2) alert us to a phase of human
occupation which is otherwise ‘missing’ from the archaeological
record and is likely also evidence of a major erosional event. We
hypothesize that cultural material cemented to the walls or columns may have survived this erosional event, and been redeposited at a later date onto the cave ﬂoor as it stabilized with
the drier conditions prevailing during the height of the Last Glacial
Maximum. This cultural material could then have been incorporated into the younger accumulating deposits. This interpretation is
speculative as perched cemented cultural deposits dating between
40,000 and 20,000 have not yet been found, although we currently
have only three dated sample points. Intensive sampling of such
deposits would be productive here. It also seems likely that sediments dating between ~6700 and ~1000 cal BP have been lost from
the cave system due to one or more erosional episodes, leaving a lag
of mixed age ﬁnds of different ages at the contact. This may have
been a result of clifﬂine retreat and roof collapse destabilizing the
area in front of the cave, leading to loss of cultural deposits from
within the cave, perhaps during the 7000 cal BP marine relative
high stand. While this is speculative it could potentially be tested
through a more extensive sampling and dating program.
We think that cycles of deposit cut and ﬁll are also responsible
for the perched cemented cultural deposits at Lene Hara where
temporal resolution and completeness varies markedly across
different areas of the cave ﬂoor. Short intervals of Pleistocene time
are well-preserved in the more elevated, southern chamber, but
local erosion and inﬁll events make the record non-synchronous
over a distance of a few tens of metres. Holocene occupation is
sparsely represented in this part of the cave, with some mixture of
Holocene cultural materials such as pot sherds into late Pleistocene
sedimentary units in Squares A and B, and the shell beads with
Holocene ages in Square A (Table 3). In the northern chamber of the
cave, a major scour or subsidence event, probably dating to the
terminal Pleistocene or early Holocene, created a deep trough that
inﬁlled progressively through the Holocene by the combined action
of episodic surface wash and the deposition of cultural debris. The
resultant inﬁll unit provides an extended, well-stratiﬁed and
temporally well-resolved Holocene sequence. In this area of the
cave breccia incorporating cultural material is found attached to
and under the eroded bases of the speleothems suggesting that
contemporary sedimentary processes, involving transport of ﬁner
sediments in episodic surface wash ﬂowing northeast across the
cave ﬂoor, between and around the larger speleothems, has existed
since the terminal Pleistocene or early Holocene. Most likely this
was preceded either by a major scour episode or by subsidence of
deposits in the northern chamber, thereby creating a depocentre
lying as a southwest-northeast aligned trough close to the northern
margin of the cave. Inﬁlling of this trough has averaged net rates of
20 cm/ka but has been irregular. Inﬁlling sediments are both
reworked cave earths and washed in sands and gravels but,
signiﬁcantly, they contain little clastic roof fall.
The combined evidence from Squares A, B, D and F thus suggests
a signiﬁcant change in cave ﬂoor sedimentation between the terminal Pleistocene and the Holocene e the earlier period characterised by deposition of large quantities of coarse clastic rock fall
and by speleothem activity, and the Holocene by lower rates of
clastic roof fall, coupled with redistribution of ﬁner sediment
fractions by surface wash channeled by a local template of ﬂowstones, speleothems and roof fall. Finally, the cave possibly saw a
major shift in depocentre into the northern chamber during the

157

terminal Pleistocene or early Holocene.
The parsimonious explanation for the Laili Holocene breccia and
absence of unconsolidated Holocene deposit is that an enormous
quantity of cave-ﬂoor deposit has been removed by people. During
the 2011 excavation the site was visited by a group of local residents
equipped with sacks, shovels and a wheelbarrow. They proceeded
to dig away an area of deposit about 10 m forward of the excavation
towards the cave entrance. When all the sacks were full they
pushed them away in the wheelbarrow. We inquired of our senior
local worker about this activity and were told that they were taking
away the cave’s soil to put on their gardens for fertilizer, that people
from the village collected it regularly and had for as long as he could
remember. On the basis that the current ﬂoor area bounded by the
back and side walls and within the drip-line is 236 m2, and the
maximum breccia height of above the current cave ﬂoor is 2.16 m
(the height of breccia sample 8); the volume of missing sediment
could be as much as 510 m3. A lower boundary, a ﬂoor 2.16 m above
the current ﬂoor sloped to meet the current surface at the outer
edge of the cave, would be about half of this estimate e 250 m3.
While this seems like a daunting amount of sediment for local
villagers to have removed, given the 3000 year history of agriculture in ISEA, the recorded practice of using caves to pen animals
thus further enriching the organic rich cave sediments with nitrogen, and the ready proximity of Laili to the village and house gardens, it is a plausible explanation to account for the missing
Holocene deposits. Whether all areas of the cave ﬂoor are similarly
affected requires extensive intra site sampling across the cave ﬂoor.
4. Conclusion
Breccia deposits containing cultural materials occur in many
caves and shelter sites where water seepage has cemented the
occupation deposit. Here we have discussed three caves where
breccia formation and removal have different causes and where
mapping of time discontinuities and lateral sequence gaps is
informative about the occupation and geomorphic history of the
sites. Notably most of the breccias sampled have no chronostratigraphic equivalent in the unlithiﬁed cave-ﬂoor archaeological deposits. The chronological intervals preserved in the breccias
would not be evident if one were to look at the deposits in the ﬂoor
excavation in isolation. In Lachitu and Lene Hara we have suggested
water erosion as the likely mechanism of cave ﬂoor deposit
removal. In Laili we have argued that physical removal by local
people is the best ﬁt interpretation. Glover’s (1979) mechanism e
dissolution of organic sediment from below does not seem
consistent with the evidence for well preserved organics at depth
in Lachitu, Lene Hara and Laili, which indicates little decay or volume reduction of the organic material.
The broader issue remains of what is responsible for the temporal “switching” of breccia formation and gutting out erosional
episodes in humid tropical caves of the type reported here. We ﬁnd
no compelling evidence of direct links to regional scale hydrology,
and can exclude ﬂoodplain alluvial ﬂoor-karst interactions of the
type described by Duringer et al. (2012). In all three case studies
sloping deposits at cave mouths across the drip-line either store the
archaeological deposits or play a signiﬁcant role in maintaining
stability of the stored archaeological deposits upslope and within
the cave. All three sites locate on generally steeper hill slopes where
bedrock outcrop orientation, slope angle and stability of large
blocks and overhang collapse have combined to produce low angle
protected depocentres at the cave mouth which serve to stabilize
and retain stratigraphic sequences further back in the cave.
This points towards geomorphic stability at and downslope of
the cave mouth as a key controlling factor in determining a depositional mode for sediment accumulation of unconsolidated ﬁlls,

158

breccias and ﬂowstones within the sites in Timor Leste and PNG. All
of these sites are well upstream of the ﬁrst knickpoint, and weakly
connected to the main gully networks or ephemeral creeks operating on adjacent slopes. Two of the three sites (Lachitu and Lene
Hara) situate in geologically young landscapes where uplifting
bedrock structure, lithology and outcrop plays a major role in river
abrasion capacity and therefore a control over response timescales
of the sedimentary routing systems to base level change (Allen,
2008; Sklar and Dietrich, 2001). Any local landscape response to
either climate or tectonic forcing is likely to be lagged and involve
complex behavior in relation to knickpoints (Bonnet and Crave,
2003) with local slope hydrology and host limestone aquifer capacities essentially decoupled from catchment-scale geomorphic
response (Bishop, 2007; Bishop et al., 1985; Grimaud et al., 2015).
Further research on the relationship of regolith stability and hillslope regolith ages upslope and downslope of these caves and the
chronology of breccia storage is likely to be instructive.
Our interim conclusion is that chronologies for active speleothem deposition, ﬂowstone accumulation and stop-start storage of
sediments as breccia are likely to be intimately coupled, as sediments cementing to breccias tend to form adjacent to carbonate
charged water on impermeable surfaces. A climate-driven chronology is therefore likely linked to phases of breccia formation.
However, rates of net unconsolidated sedimentation clearly relate
in part to accumulation of anthopogenically-imported deposits.
Hearth pits, stone lines, fences and deposit removal (as at Laili)
show the very considerable human role in determining the nature
and stability of sedimentation around and within the cave
entrance. At all three sites mid to late Holocene anthropogenic
destabilization of soils and slopes, latterly from human sedentism
and agriculture, may be signiﬁcant (and temporally lagged) processes destabilizing the slopes below the caves and thus indirectly
re-setting the local (micro) base levels determining depocentre
architectures within and at the cave mouth.
In summary, data from the three sites suggests local, autogenic
and quasi-stochastic processes drive the development of depocentre space into which sediments then accumulate and store.
Similarly the erosive gutting events may be largely set by local
hydrodynamic processes speciﬁc to the cave (Bosch and White,
2004; Gillieson, 1996), operating in relation to stability of adjacent slopes and hydrology and mass transfer within the host
limestone rock architecture. Human activity may be a major
contributor and driver of sediment inputs and outputs over late
Quaternary timescales producing the occupation deposits and then
extracting them as fertilizer. The phasing of cementation into
breccias is more likely to be coupled to regional climate trends. The
relationship of the time sequences of archaeological record preserved as unconsolidated sediments as compared with those
cemented as remnants on cave walls and speleothem structures is
therefore likely to be extremely complex reﬂecting both regional
climate, lagged catchment effects on slopes below the cave mouth,
co-seismic rock fall and endogenic processes in the cave mouth.
This points to the considerable research potential in small
tropical humid caves for comparing chronologies and proxy records
from ﬂowstone and speleothem with archaeological chronologies
stored i) in remnant lithiﬁed cave breccias and ii) adjacent cave
ﬂoors as unconsolidated deposit sequences.
One of the most signiﬁcant ﬁndings from all three archaeological sites discussed therefore concerns sampling. The results clearly
demonstrate that cave deposits in humid tropical regions are
stratigraphically complex, reﬂecting multiple erosional and depositional episodes together with long term shifts in sedimentary
processes. This complexity means that a complete cultural and
chronological sequence may not survive as a stratigraphic column
in any single part of a site. Rather, the history of human occupation

may only be recovered by integrating data from a number of
different stratigraphic columns, each preserving parts of the
depositional and erosional history of the site, coupled with the
dating of cemented cultural deposits perched on walls to tell us
about ‘missing time’ which might not be recoverable in any of the
cave ﬂoor stratigraphy.
A problem of equal magnitude, in terms of our interpretation of
the human occupation record is the demonstrated re-deposition of
old shell, charcoal and bone into deposits which are much younger.
This can potentially bias the chronological and archaeological record. As many of the caves in tropical regions (e.g. Lachitu and Lene
Hara) demonstrate cementation with depth it may not be possible
to distinguish cultural material which has cemented into breccia in
situ from that which has been re-deposited as cemented clasts,
without an extensive program of dating.

Methodology
Excavation
Excavation Units (EUs) (cf. spits) varied in depth between 2 and
8 cm and where possible followed visible stratigraphic changes or
divisions in the deposit. With the exception of large rocks excavated
material was wet-sieved through a 1.5 mm sieve and dried prior to
sorting.
Selection of samples for radiocarbon dating
With the exception of the dates obtained by Gorecki et al. (1991)
all radiocarbon dates presented are AMS dates on charcoal or marine shell. Where available charcoal was selected for radiocarbon
dating, however, charcoal was not preserved below the surﬁcial
EUs at Lene Hara or Lachitu and thus marine shell was used for
dating. Suspension feeding marine bivalves are believed to produce
the most reliable marine shell ages however these shellﬁsh are
uncommon along the north coasts of Timor and Papua New Guinea
and are correspondingly poorly represented in the archaeological
assemblages. We have thus had to use a variety of fully marine
gastropods such as Turbo sp. and Tectus sp. for dating at Lene Hara
and Lachitu. The parts of the shells selected for dating varied. In
some cases opercula were used as this part of the shell is dense and
preserves well. In other cases the entire shell was sent to the dating
laboratory. Marine shells used for dating were tested by the laboratories for recrystallisation and were not dated if they were less
than 96% primary aragonite. A DeltaR correction has not been
applied to any of the shell dates as no research has been undertaken
on DeltaR for these species for the north coast of PNG or for Timor
Leste and DeltaR is known to vary even within individual species
depending on the substrate on which they live and graze and
freshwater input to the environment (Petchey et al., 2012).

Few studies have been carried out into 14C variation in depositfeeding mangrove species but a recent study undertaken at Caution
Bay in Papua New Guinea on the mud whelk Cerithidae indicates
that mangrove/mudﬂat gastropods produce the least reliable calendar ages as they ingest sediment within the estuary that contains
14
C derived from both enriched and depleted sources (Petchey
et al., 2012). However researchers in Australia have used these
species for dating open middens and cave deposits where they are
the dominant or exclusive species in northern Australian sites
(Bradshaw, 1995; Faulkner, 2013:172e3). This was the case at Laili
where the mangrove-dwelling gastropod Terebralia sp. was used for
dating some of the perched cemented breccia samples as only
Terebralia, freshwater gastropods and bone were identiﬁed in some
of the aggregate clasts. A Terebralia was also used to date EU 2 Wall
sample A at Laili to compare with charcoal Wall sample B. Terebralia
Wall sample A appears to be in good accord overlying and being
about 1000 years younger than charcoal Wall sample B.
