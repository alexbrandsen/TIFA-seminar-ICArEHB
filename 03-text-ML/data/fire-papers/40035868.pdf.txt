Radiocarbon Dates

The excavations and coring produced 27 viable
radiocarbon dates; 15 are from charcoal, one from
bone, six from soil humates, and five from organ-

ically enriched sediments. Details are listed in
Table 1 and sample locations are shown in Figures
5-7.

Fourteen of the 15 charcoal samples are greater

than 3000 cal B.C., which not only establishes a
minimum age for the Watson Brake earthworks, but

also places the Middle Archaic age (3000 cal B.C.)
of the site beyond any reasonable doubt. The sin-

gle younger date (1880 ± 120 cal B.C., B-95003)
is on charcoal that is clearly not in situ and should
be rejected. From the top of the D-l fill (Figure 5),
it is out of stratigraphic order with all other dates
in Mound D and is younger than any date from the

site (Figure 8). Possible causes of this stratigraphic
inversion are uncertain. While some of the charcoal may be intrusive, a complicating factor is that

the tiny in situ sample had to be augmented with
particles taken from the screens.
Another inversion is the age determined on the

charcoal scatter (3650 ± 100 cal B.C., B-72512)
from the A2bl horizon in B-3 of Mound B (Figure 5). It is 300 years older than charcoal (3350 ±
1 10 cal B.C., B-72672), just ca. 5 cm lower in the
same horizon (Figure 5), and 150 years older than

charcoal (3500 ± 110 cal B.C., B-80792) in the
lower Ab3 horizon (B-l). The older age (3650 ±
100 cal B.C., B-72512) is rejected as one determined on secondary refuse, probably incorporated
when terrace midden material was recycled into the

mound fill.
