ABSTRACT

This paper describes a new method for the automatic detection of pit structures in airborne laser scanning data
collected with at least Ô¨Åve emitted pulses per square metre. Oppland County, Norway, has a large number of
ancient iron production sites and hunting systems. Today, these are manifested as pits in the ground. The iron
production sites were used 1400‚Äì700 yr ago, and consist of charcoal burning pits, often located in groups of four
around a central oven, which also occasionally can be located as a small mound. The hunting systems were used
2000‚Äì500 yr ago, and consisted of concealed pitfall traps and wooden fences, located on deer trekking routes. The
fences are gone, but the pits remain. Many of the iron production sites and hunting systems are located in forested areas.
The current, traditional mapping of these is relatively poor, with many individual pits missing, and poor positional accuracy
of the ones that are mapped. This means that overlays of cultural heritage sites cannot be trusted when planning new
highways, residential areas, cabins, etc. Experience suggests that automatic detection is clearly superior to visual
inspection of the lidar data in Ô¨Ånding small pits or pits that are not easily visible. However, visual inspection is better at
Ô¨Ånding additional information as human interpretation based on archaeological knowledge can be applied. Combining
these two methods secures a very good basis for subsequent Ô¨Åeld survey. In conclusion, we demonstrate that automatic
detection of hunting systems and iron extraction sites in lidar data is a valuable tool in combination with visual inspection
of the lidar data, prior to Ô¨Åeld survey. Provided that the point density of the lidar data is high enough, the Ô¨Åeld survey can
be accomplished ten times faster compared with the traditional approach without lidar data. Copyright ¬© 2012 John Wiley

Introduction
The increasingly intensive use and modiÔ¨Åcation of the
landscape resulting from modern demands for efÔ¨Åcient
infrastructure and land use (agricultural production,
mining, energy sources, leisure/tourism facilities, etc.)
exerts growing pressure on cultural heritage in the
landscape. In order to match the political intentions of
updated and sustainable cultural heritage management,
it is necessary to develop a cost-effective method for

locating and monitoring cultural heritage sites. In recognition of this, The Norwegian Directorate for Cultural
Heritage started a project in 2002 with the overall aim
of developing a cost-effective method for surveying
and monitoring cultural heritage sites on a regional
and national scale. The initial stages focused on detecting soil marks and crop marks in agricultural land
(Aurdal et al., 2006; Trier et al., 2009).
Oppland County in Norway has a large number of
ancient iron production sites and hunting systems.
Today, these are manifested as pits in the ground. The
iron production sites were used 1400‚Äì700 yr ago, and
consist of charcoal burning pits, often located in

occasionally can be located as a small mound. The hunting systems were used 2000‚Äì500 yr ago, and consisted of
concealed pitfall traps and wooden fences, located in
deer trekking routes. The fences are gone, but the pits
remain. Many of the iron production sites and hunting
systems are located in forested areas. The current,
traditional mapping of these is relatively poor, with
many individual pits missing, and poor positional
accuracy of the ones that are mapped. This means that
overlays of cultural heritage sites cannot be trusted when
planning new highways, residential areas, cabins, etc.
Airborne laser scanning, or lidar, is a relatively new
data source that allows very detailed mapping of
the ground surface, even in forested areas. Recently,
airborne lidar has been used for the purpose of detecting
cultural heritage sites. Bewley et al. (2005) used a digital
elevation model (DEM) derived from lidar height
measurements to map previously unknown details of
the Stonehenge World Heritage Site. The height
accuracy of the lidar measurements was able to reveal
details that previously had been overlooked. Devereux
et al. (2005, 2008) explored the possibilities of varying
the sun elevation and illumination direction when hillshading the lidar DEM, and noted that some structures
may be missed by human interpretation if only one
illumination direction is used. They further demonstrated that by using only the lidar pulses that were
reÔ¨Çected by the ground, and not the lidar pulses
reÔ¨Çected by trees, in effect removing the forest vegetation from the DEM, a very detailed elevation model of
the ground was obtained. For the particular study site,
more detail was apparent in the DEM than could be seen
in the existing archaeological map. Hesse (2010)
subtracted a smoothed version of the ground surface
DEM from the original to obtain a local height model,
thus enhancing local detail and suppressing the largescale terrain. The local height model could be viewed
directly as a grey-scale image. It was often an advantage
to view both the local height model and a hill-shade
model of the original ground surface DEM to get the
landscape context when doing visual interpretation.
Kokalj et al. (2011) computed the sky-view factor to
emphasize local detail. Hesse (2010) noticed that some
archaeological structures, such as burial mounds, can
be confused with natural phenomena such as small
natural hills, wood piles, and patches of low vegetation.
Doneus et al. (2008) and Coluzzi et al. (2010) used fullwaveform lidar to better discriminate between low
vegetation and structures of archaeological interest.
Automatic detection in lidar data may be done either
directly on the lidar point cloud or on a derived DEM
with a suitably chosen pixel size. Sampath and Shan
(2010) extracted planar surfaces directly from the point

cloud to detect building roofs. Wang and Tseng (2004)
used an octree subdivision of the point cloud to identify
planar patches, then merging patches belonging to the
same plane. To extract buildings, Rottensteiner and
Briese (2002) Ô¨Åltered the lidar points into terrain and
off-terrain points in an iterative process, resulting in a
digital terrain model (DTM), which is a smoothed model
of the terrain points, and a digital surface model (DSM),
which is a non-smoothed model of all the lidar points.
The DTM was subtracted from the DSM, resulting
in a local height model. This DEM was then used for
building extraction. Kwak et al. (2007) used the
TerraScan software to classify lidar points into
ground, low vegetation, medium vegetation and high
vegetation. The high vegetation returns were used to
generate a DSM, while the ground returns gave a
DTM. By subtracting the DTM from the DSM, a digital
canopy model (DCM) was obtained, and individual
trees were extracted from this DEM.

Data and methods
Airborne lidar height measurements
In this study, two lidar datasets from Oppland County,
Norway, have been used (Figure 1, Table 1).
Olstappen dataset
For an area surrounding the lake Olstappen in
Nord-Fron municipality, data were acquired by helicopter, with a minimum of 10 emitted laser pulses per
square metre. The data set covered a total area of
29.3 km2, with 7.3 ground hits per square metre on average. This terrain is dominated by open pine forest,
allowing a large proportion of hits from the ground.
The dataset is divided into 600 m  800 m tiles (Figure 2).
This area is known to contain several systems of pitfall
traps that were used in moose hunting 500‚Äì2000 yr ago.
√òystre Slidre dataset
For a 400 km2 area in √òystre Slidre municipality,
lidar data were collected in June 2011, with Ô¨Åve
emitted pulses per square metre and 2.1 ground hits
per square metre on average. This area is known to
contain a number of ancient iron production sites, with
many visible coal burning pits. The particular choice of
point density was determined from the analysis of the
reduced point density datasets presented later. The
√òystre Slidre data set is subdivided into 1 km by
1 km tiles, 487 in total.

Reduced point density versions of the Olstappen dataset
In order to simulate the effect of acquiring lidar at
lower point density, reduced point density versions
of the Olstappen dataset are produced as follows. For
each ground reÔ¨Çection, a number between 0.0 and 1.0

is drawn randomly from a uniform distribution. Then,
for each point sampling factor, a ground reÔ¨Çection is
kept if the associated random number is below the

sampling factor. For example, if the point sampling
factor is 0.1, then only ground reÔ¨Çections with random
numbers below 0.1 are included. For each ground
reÔ¨Çection, the associated random number is drawn
only once, so that if the ground reÔ¨Çection is included
at a speciÔ¨Åc point sampling factor, then it is included
for all higher point sampling factors as well.
Twenty point sampling factors were used, from
1.0 to 0.001, resulting in point sampling densities
between 7.277 and 0.007 points per square metre
(Table 2).

(i) Create a triangulation of all the ground returns.
(ii) Convert the triangulation to a digital elevation
model (DEM) with 0.2 m ground resolution in the
x and y coordinates, and Ô¨Çoating point-valued
height values in metres.

Detection method
The detection method uses the following main steps,
similar to the ring detection method for soil marks and
crop marks in optical images (Trier et al., 2009):

Automatic detection of pits in lidar height images
As we already had a processing chain for the automatic
detection of circular structures in optical images (Trier
et al., 2009), it was practical to reuse this processing
chain, adapting it to the detection of circular pit
structures in a raster image representation of the lidar
height data (Figure 3).
Preprocessing of LAS Ô¨Åles
The lidar data are available as binary data Ô¨Åles in
the LAS Ô¨Åle format (LAS SpeciÔ¨Åcation, 2010), containing
up to four returns per emitted laser pulse. Each return
contains x, y and z coordinates in UTM zone 32, and a
class label denoting ground, vegetation or building
point. We are only interested in the ground points,
and prefer to do the detection on a regular grid (image)
rather than arbitrary points. The following steps
are used to convert the LAS Ô¨Åles to DEM Ô¨Åles with a
0.2 m grid in the x‚Äìy plane, with Ô¨Çoating point height
values in metres. This gives 25 grid cells per square
metre, and appears to preserve all the detail of
lidar point clouds with up to 10 emitted pulses per
square metre.

Automatic detection of pits in ALS data
(i) Convolve the DEM height image with templates
of varying sizes. Threshold each convolution
result to obtain detections.
(ii) Merge detections that are closer than a distance
threshold, keeping the strongest detections.
(iii) For each detection, compute different measurements of the deviation from an ideal model,
using different measures than the convolution
in step 1.
(iv) Remove detections that have measurement values
outside prescribed intervals.
(v) (Optional) Remove detections that are adjacent to
roads and water courses.
Pit templates. Each pit template in step 1 is a hemisphere
with a ring edge (Figure 4). We used 12 pit templates
with radii from 6 to 17 pixels, that is, 1.2 to 3.4 m, each
template having 1 pixel (0.2 m) larger radius than the
next smaller.
Merging of detections. In step 2, for each detection, if
another detection is closer than the Ô¨Årst detection‚Äôs
radius, the two detections are merged, keeping the
stronger of the two detections. The distance between
two detections is measured between their centres.
Computation of attributes. In step 3, the following
attributes are computed:

(i) Normalized correlation value, that is, the correlation value divided by the radius.
(ii) Average pit depth, measured as the height
difference between the lowest point inside the
pit and the average height on the ring edge
outside the pit.
(iii) Minimum pit depth, measured as the height
difference between the lowest point inside the
pit and the lowest point on the ring edge.
(iv) Standard deviation of height values on the ring
edge.

Figure 4. Pit template. White pixels are +1, black pixels are 1, and
grey pixels in between. The medium grey pixels outside the white ring
edge are exactly zero, thus not contributing to the convolution value.
This particular pit template has a radius of 17 pixels, or 3.4 m.

(v) Root mean square deviation from a perfect
hemisphere, i.e., a perfect U-shaped pit.
(vi) Root mean square deviation from a perfect Vshaped pit.
(vii) For each pit, a threshold is deÔ¨Åned as the value
that separates the pixels inside the pit into two
groups, the 25% of the pixels that are darker than
the threshold, and the 75% that are brighter. Use
this threshold to extract a dark segment from a
square image centred on the pit, with sides equal
to six times the radius. This is called the
25%-segment. If this results in a compact, central
segment inside the pit, connected to a larger
segment outside the pit, with only a few
connecting pixels on a ring just outside the pit,
then the central segment is separated from the
outside segment. From the extracted segment,
the following measures are computed:
Offset ‚Äì distance from pit centre to the segment‚Äôs
centre.
Major axis length ‚Äì as deÔ¨Åned by Prokop and
Reeves (1992).
Elongation ‚Äì deÔ¨Åned as major axis divided by
radius (Figure 5)
(viii) Similar the to above, extract the 50% segment
and compute offset, major axis and elongation
from that segment as well
Thresholds on attribute values. With true pits labelled, the
pit detections can the be sorted on one attribute at a
time, to determine suitable thresholds that are able to
separate at least some false detections from the true.
The thresholds should not be set too tight, as this
may lead to true pits being removed by mistake in
another dataset. In the event of a large number of
training samples, an attribute selection method (e.g.,
Somol et al., 1999) and multivariate statistical analysis
(e.g., Hastie et al., 2009) can be used to design a
classiÔ¨Åer.
We used the tile in Figure 2 as a guide in selecting a
subset of the attributes and setting thresholds.
However, by setting the thresholds too tight there is a
risk of losing some true detections. Further, the
datasets with reduced sampling density will probably
need looser thresholds. So, we relaxed the thresholds
and used:

normalized correlation > 2.0
minimum depth > 0.1
average depth > 0.5
RMS U-shape < 0.1
RMS V-shape < 0.1
25% segment elongation < 4

Note that the detection method was run on the elevation image, not on the hill-shade image.

We use this on the entire Olstappen dataset. All
detections are manually checked by visual inspection
of the hill-shaded lidar data and labelled with a score
1‚Äì9, with 9 being an obviously correct detection, 5
being in doubt, and 1 being a clear misdetection.
Values of 2 or 3 mean probable misclassiÔ¨Åcations, but
somehow resembling a pit, 4 is not used and 6‚Äì8 mean
probable detections. A selection of the automatic
detections with manually assigned scores in the range
5‚Äì9 are checked in the Ô¨Åeld by archaeologists.
Next, the dataset is split in two parts: a training set
and a test set, each containing half the conÔ¨Årmed pits.
The division was carried out by sorting the conÔ¨Årmed
pits by the LAS Ô¨Åle names in alphabetical order. We
want the system to assign score values automatically
to all detections and these should correspond to how
conÔ¨Ådent the system is that a detection is a potential

cultural heritage pit (Table 3). The automatic detections
can then be overlain on a map, with, e.g., separate colours for each conÔ¨Ådence level, for subsequent
Ô¨Åeld inspection.
The training set contains 1129 automatic detections,
of which 25 are conÔ¨Årmed pits by Ô¨Åeld inspection,
104 are pits conÔ¨Årmed by visual inspection only and
the remaining 1000 detections are regarded as non-pits
by visual inspection only. Each of the 1129 detections
have 14 attributes that may be used to assign conÔ¨Ådence values (Table 4).
We sort the training set on each of the attributes in
turn, to Ô¨Ånd reasonable thresholds for each of the conÔ¨Ådence levels. Some of the attributes were found to
have little discriminatory power, and thresholds were
not used. This results in seven threshold tests (Table 5)
in a combined IF-test. For a detection to achieve a

each reduced sampling density, the automatic detections
are compared with the automatic detections on the full
resolution as follows. For each detection in the full resolution, the closest detection in the reduced resolution is
located. If the distance between their centres is less than
2 m, then the detection is counted as ‚Äòfound‚Äô in the
reduced version.

The detection obtains the best possible conÔ¨Ådence

Before we could apply the automatic method on the

(Table 6). Of the 134 pits in the training set that were
conÔ¨Årmed by archaeologists, 122 pits achieved
‚Äòmedium‚Äô conÔ¨Ådence or better (Table 7) by the automatic method, seven pits received ‚Äòlow‚Äô conÔ¨Ådence,
and Ô¨Åve pits were not detected. For the independent
test set, the results were slightly worse, with fewer true
detections with very high conÔ¨Ådence, and more true
detections with low or medium conÔ¨Ådence than in
the training set (Table 8). Still, the conÔ¨Ådence levels

The conÔ¨Ådence levels reÔ¨Çect the trade-off between
detecting as many pits as possible, while at the same
time limiting false detection. For example, 114 of 133
pits of archaeological interest were detected with
medium conÔ¨Ådence or better (Table 9); this is 85.7%
of the pits of archaeological interest (Table 10). At the
same time, 103 of the detections with medium

During the Ô¨Åeld work, an assessment was carried out
for each pit to determine if it was a pitfall trap, a coal

burning pit, or a Ô¨Çat coal burning site (Table 11). The
majority of pits have not yet been surveyed in the Ô¨Åeld.
The automatic detection method is able to locate pits
of archaeological interest in varying surrounding landscape. Pitfall traps were detected in quite Ô¨Çat terrain
(Figure 6a) and on a moderate ridge (Figure 6b). Also,
a small pitfall trap that was overlooked during visual

inspection of the lidar data was detected by the
automatic method (Figure 7).
However, there are also pits of archaeological interest that the automatic method fails to detect. At one
location, two of four coal burning pits were missed by
the automatic method (Figure 8). For the northwestern
of these (ID = 290), the problem seems to be missing

ground returns inside the pit due to trees (Figure 9).
This makes the pit appear Ô¨Çat in the lidar height image.
For the southwestern of the four pits (ID = 291), the pit
is Ô¨Ålled with dead branches. The northeastern of the
four pits (ID = 187) is somewhat distorted in the lidar
data, due to the trees on one side of the edge of the
pit, but still the pit is detected by the automatic method
with ‚Äòmedium‚Äô conÔ¨Ådence. The southeastern of the four
pits (ID = 186) is quite small, with 2.5 m diameter, and
not easy to spot in the Ô¨Åeld even at a short distance
(Figure 9). Still, the pit is visible in the lidar data
(Figure 8) and was also detected by the automatic
method with ‚Äòmedium‚Äô conÔ¨Ådence.
The problem with missing ground hits inside
pits due to trees is also observed at another location
(Figure 10a). On one occasion the automatic method
did not detect a pit located on a narrow ridge with a
steep cliff on one side (Figure 10b). Also, the automatic
method did not detect pits with shapes that deviated
too much from ideal pits (Figure 10c and d).
During the Ô¨Åeld work, 16 charcoal burning sites
were found (Figures 11 and 12). Each charcoal burning
site is often surrounded by a circular, shallow ditch,
but is otherwise Ô¨Çat (Figure 11) or mound-shaped
(Figure 12). Except for one, these were not detected
by the automatic method. As the automatic method
is not designed to detect such shapes, the missed
charcoal burning sites are not counted in Tables 7‚Äì9.

Another potential problem with the automatic
method are pits that are split on a tile boundary, or
are so close to the edge that a pit template would be
partially outside if the template is centred on the
pit. We have only seen one example of this in the
Olstappen dataset (Figure 13). On the other hand,
the automatic method was able to detect two partially
collapsed pitfall traps, but with low conÔ¨Ådence
(Figure 14).

Detection of pits in reduced point density versions of
lidar data
The analysis was performed on the entire Olstappen
dataset (Table 12). For the purpose of measuring the
reduced detection on the datasets with reduced point
density, detections of categories 5‚Äì9, spanning the
detections labelled ‚Äòin doubt‚Äô, ‚Äòprobable detection‚Äô
and ‚Äòcertain detection‚Äô are considered. These are 262
in total. For the datasets of reduced point densities,
the number of detections is given in the two rightmost
columns of Table 12 as absolute and relative Ô¨Ågures.
By inspecting the reduced point density datasets it
can be observed that all pits are degraded in shape as

Copyright ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

the point density is reduced (Figure 15), and that small
pits are more affected than large pits. For example, at
0.29 ground returns per square metre the two larger
pits are still detected and still resemble pits (Figure 15),
but one pit has completely vanished and one other
small pit is so degraded that it is difÔ¨Åcult to see.
By plotting the detection percentages, relative to the
full resolution dataset, as a function of point density
per square metre (Figure 16), the recognition rate drops
slowly from 100% to 82% as the point density is
reduced from 7.3 to 1.8 ground points per square
metre. When the point density is reduced further
below 1.8 points per square metre the recognition
rate drops more rapidly, reaching 50% at around 0.6
ground points per square metre. Based on this
analysis, it was decided to acquire the lidar data for
√òystre Slidre municipality with Ô¨Åve emitted laser
pulses per square metre.

lower thresholds (Table 13) in the method that assigns
conÔ¨Ådence values to the detected pits.
The goal of the ongoing large-area survey in √òystre
Slidre is to secure a trustworthy basis for cultural
heritage management in an area with few registered
ancient monuments, but a large number of unregistered
monuments. After laser scanning the data was
submitted to the cultural heritage management
authorities for visual inspection and to the Norwegian
Computing Center for automatic detection. The
resulting inspection and detection Ô¨Åles were then
submitted to the Ô¨Åeld crew. Control of objects in the Ô¨Åeld
was undertaken using a Leica DPOS for guidance,
which displays both visually inspected and automatically detected objects on a projected map. This procedure

is extremely efÔ¨Åcient and cuts Ô¨Åeld time by about 90%,
compared with traditional surface surveys. This is only
a rough estimate by the archaeologists involved, and
does not include purchasing of lidar data, running the
automatic detection method and visual inspection of
the lidar data.
After the automatic detection method had been
applied, false detections along roads and water courses
were manually assigned very low conÔ¨Ådence for 36
tiles. However, in the subsequent Ô¨Åeld work it was
found that this was not so important, as these situations were easy to spot in the relief-shaded printouts
of the lidar data that were used in the Ô¨Åeld work. So,
the manual reassignment of conÔ¨Ådence for detections
along roads and water courses was dropped for the
remaining tiles.

Initially, most emphasis was placed on the visually
located objects, while automatically detected pits
were checked if they had ‚Äòhigh‚Äô conÔ¨Ådence or if they
were situated in groups, which is typical for iron
extraction sites. Quickly, however, the Ô¨Åeld crew discovered that in many instances even ‚Äòlow‚Äô conÔ¨Ådence
objects were ancient pits. Following this discovery
most automatically detected objects were checked in
the Ô¨Åeld ‚Äì if not obviously false. This led to the
discovery of a number of sites unnoticed by visual
inspection of the data.

(Figure 17). The track measures 5.8 km (3.6 miles) and
was accomplished within 4 h. The track visited 47
automatic detections and an additional 10 visual
detections, all marked on the map prior to the
Ô¨Åeld work. The resulting map of archaeological interpretations gave 13 iron extraction sites and four single
charcoal burning pits (Figure 18). One of the iron
production sites was not detected visually in the lidar
data (Figure 19).
Some areas contained a very high number of detections, so high that suspicion arose beforehand that
natural characteristics of the terrain were the cause. This
was conÔ¨Årmed by Ô¨Åeld inspection. In such areas only

objects with ‚Äòhigh‚Äô conÔ¨Ådence were checked initially, and
only if these objects proved to be ‚Äòtrue‚Äô did Ô¨Åeld
conÔ¨Årmation extend to objects of ‚Äòlow‚Äô conÔ¨Ådence.
Experience from the Ô¨Åeld work suggests that automatic detection is clearly superior to visual inspection
of the lidar data in Ô¨Ånding small pits or pits that are
not easily visible. Visual inspection is better at Ô¨Ånding
additional information on sites, because human interpretation based on archaeological knowledge can be
applied. Combining these two methods secures a very
good basis for the subsequent Ô¨Åeld survey. Also, automatic detection replaces the need for tedious, accurate
manual digitizing of pit locations, leaving the operator
to accept pits in a yes/no manner. Only the very

limited number of missed pits needs to be accurately
digitized manually.

Discussion
The detection results on the Olstappen test set indicate
that the automatic method is capable of detecting 95%
of the pits of archaeological interest that were visible
in the terrain, while at the same time producing four
times as many false detections as true detections.
Experience from Ô¨Åeld work indicates that this is an
acceptable trade-off. Further, it was observed that the
automatic method was able to detect several small pits
that were overlooked by visual inspection of the lidar
data. The combined use of automatic detection and
visual inspection prior to Ô¨Åeld survey is now being
used by archaeologists in Oppland County, Norway,
for the mapping of ancient hunting systems and iron
production sites.
As the automatic method was trained on only one
geographic area, one risk is that the method was optimized for this area only, and not necessarily applicable
in other geographic areas, with other varieties of archaeological pits. To compensate for this the conÔ¨Ådence
thresholds were slightly relaxed before the automatic
method was applied to the √òystre Slidre dataset. The

ongoing Ô¨Åeld survey in √òystre Slidre municipality
indicates that the automatic method is able to capture
almost all pits of archaeological interest in this area
as well, and that many of the false detections can be
spotted quite easily by an experienced archaeologist.
The automatic method is not designed to detect Ô¨Çat
or mound-shaped charcoal burning sites. It would
have been useful if the automatic method were able
to detect these as well. However, one major obstacle
is the low number of training samples of such sites.
Also, they are less visible in the data and therefore
more difÔ¨Åcult to detect by an automatic method.
Another possible extension could be to detect intact
grave mounds, which are mounds of roughly the same
size as the pitfall traps. There are forested areas in
Vestfold County, Norway, that are known to contain

Copyright ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

intact grave mounds, and when lidar data of sufÔ¨Åcient
point density of such areas become available, an
attempt can be made to extend the method to detect
grave mounds and, possibly, other mounds of
archaeological interest. Further, there is a need for an
automatic method to detect linear structures in lidar
data, such as stone fences and walls.
The results of the experiments with reducing the
point density of lidar data indicate that 1.8 ground
returns per square metre is a minimum requirement
for the detection of pitfall traps. It should be stressed
that the point densities in the experiments are ground
returns, excluding vegetation and building returns.
The speciÔ¨Åcations of the datasets refer to the number
of emitted pulses, some of which never reach the
ground. Therefore, when the experiments suggest that

the same ground return density. For our datasets,
about 70% of the emitted laser pulses hit the ground,
requiring about 2.5 emitted pulses per square metre
as a minimum. Further, increased point density makes
visual interpretation easier, which is important if one

wishes to visually verify automatic detections and
identify false detections and missing detections. Also,
if smaller archaeological structures are to be mapped,
higher point density is needed. The Norwegian
Mapping Authority has started a national lidar data
acquisition in order to produce a new national digital
elevation model, with an acquisition resolution of 0.7
emitted pulses per square metre. For the Olstappen
dataset, this would result in about 50‚Äì55% recognition
rate. In general, lidar data can be acquired at a very
high density for an initial, representative small part
of the area to be mapped. Then, a point reduction
experiment can be conducted to determine the
required point density.
Three other effects are not addressed in the point
reduction experiment. First, the Ô¨Çying height is higher
when acquiring lower point densities, meaning that
the footprint on the ground of each emitted laser pulse
is larger, which means that the measured elevation is
averaged over a larger area. Second, the shape of
the pitfall traps and other pits are more distorted
(Figure 14), meaning that the manual inspection of
the detection results could be more difÔ¨Åcult. In the
present experiment, we had the luxury of doing the
manual inspection on the full resolution dataset. Third,
the number of false detections may increase.
In the point reduction experiment, a detection can
be moved by up to 2 m and still be valid. We have
not investigated how much detections actually moved
in the reduced datasets. Obviously, if detections are
moved, this has implications on the accuracy of the
centre coordinates of pits. Similarly, reduced point
density has implications on the measured radii
and depths of pits.
In the Olstappen dataset, we observed that a large
number of false detections occur at water courses and
along roads (e.g., footpath tunnels, bridges over small
creeks, etc.). To remove these, GIS layers for roads
and water courses could be used to mask these areas.
The reason that these false detections occur at all is that
we have to tolerate quite substantial deviations from
an ideal pit to capture the true archaeological pits.
The amount of deviation is reÔ¨Çected in the conÔ¨Ådence
levels.
When generating the DEM we used the lidar returns
that were labelled ‚Äòground‚Äô by the lidar data provider.
During Ô¨Åeld survey we have observed that low vegetation is sometimes confused with the ground, which
occasionally may lead to false pits in the DEM. Doneus
et al. (2008) and Coluzzi et al. (2010) used full waveform lidar to better discriminate between ground and
low vegetation. At the moment, full waveform lidar
data are not collected by the commercial lidar data

providers. However, this is likely to change in the
future, as also the forest industry is interested in full
waveform lidar for better forest inventory estimation
(e.g., see Pirotti, 2011).
It should be stressed that no automatic method can
be expected to Ô¨Ånd 100% of the phenomena of archaeological interest in a dataset. Further, no single dataset
can be expected to produce a complete archaeological
map. Even a combination of different data sets, be it
lidar data, aerial and satellite images, hyperspectral
scanning, and/or geophysical survey, will give an
incomplete archaeological map (Powlesland, 2011).
Indeed, the absence of evidence must not be taken as
an evidence of absence of archaeology (Powlesland,
2011). Having said all this, automatic methods may
be an important tool in providing more complete and
accurate archaeological maps, especially when applied
to lidar data with a large number of phenomena of
archaeological interest.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that automatic
detection of pit structures in lidar data is a valuable
tool in combination with visual inspection of the lidar
data, prior to subsequent Ô¨Åeld survey. Provided that
the point density of the lidar data is high enough, the
time spent on Ô¨Åeld survey can be reduced by around
90% compared with the traditional approach without
lidar data. Obviously, the reduction in Ô¨Åeld time is
mainly due to the use of lidar data in itself, but automatic detection contributes both by reducing the time
required for visual interpretation and by detecting pits
that are missed during visual inspection.
