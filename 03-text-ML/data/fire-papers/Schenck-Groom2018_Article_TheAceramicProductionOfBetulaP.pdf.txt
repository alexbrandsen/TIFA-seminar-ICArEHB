Abstract Following on from our previous research into the
prehistoric aceramic distillation and production of birch bark
tar, this series of exploratory experiments investigated the use
of raised structures within a fire. These field-based experiments were conducted using sand, gravel, wood fuel, and bark
from Betula pubescens (downy birch). The structures that
were created were simple raised sand mounds, which reflected
known Neanderthal combustion surfaces from the Middle
Palaeolithic. The bulk of the experiments were recorded
throughout using a thermocouple to provide temperature readings from the base of the bark pyrolysis chamber. The experiments proved successful at producing birch bark tar and several containers were used to catch the tar for later analysis.
Based on the results, the authors contend that not only could
Neanderthals control fire but that regular birch bark tar production by Neanderthals was most likely a result of specific
chaînes opératoires in order to provide the necessary control
and outcomes.

Introduction
The use of tar extracted from the bark of Betula sp. (birch
species) stretches from the Middle Palaeolithic, through to
the Mesolithic (Aveling and Heron 1998), the Neolithic
(Bosquet et al. 2001; Urem-Kotsou et al. 2002), the Iron
Age (e.g. Regert et al. 2003; Charters et al. 1993; Sauter
et al. 2002), until modern times. Its use takes many forms,
adhesive agent, possibly a masticant medicine (Aveling and
Heron 1999) while the Ojibwa in North America used birch
bark tar (mainly from Betula papyrifera) for waterproofing
birch bark canoes (Lyford 1943).
Birch bark tar may well be the first synthetic product constructed by humans (Grünberg 2002: 15), and finds from
Campitello Quarry in the Upper Valdarno Basin, Italy, may
as yet be the earliest, potentially dating to c.250–260 000 BP
(Mazza et al. 2006).
Other finds of note come from the Micoquian site of IndenAltdorf in the Inde Valley, Germany, where 82 artefacts dating
to c.120 000 BP yielded small amounts of a black residue that
were confirmed to be birch bark tar. The residue was observed
on a range of artefacts, from scrapers to projectile points as
well as a flat sandstone pebble; many implements were also
associated with hafting use-wear (Pawlik and Thissen 2011b).
Notable finds of birch bark tar also come from Königsaue
in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, dating to c.50 000 BP. One specimen, Königsaue B, forms an oblong lump, seemingly
kneaded by a hand. The other specimen, Königsaue A, is
assigned to the Micoquo-Prodnikien culture and has imprints
of both a flint blade and a wooden haft, suggestive of its
function as an adhesive (Grünberg 2002; Koller et al. 2001).
Some procedures for the production of small amounts of
birch bark tar are well known, most employing some sort of
airtight, fireproof container such as ceramic plant-pots or metal tins, neither of which have a particularly long history

20

(Pawlik 2004: 173; Weiner 2005: 25–26). The production of
birch bark tar usually involves pyrolysis (the chemical decomposition of the bark) under controlled circumstances, usually
resulting in charred bark, tar and gas (Vreugdenhil and Zwart
2009). The process takes place in an anoxic atmosphere between the temperature ranges of 250–400 °C. If this threshold
is exceeded or oxygen enters the pyrolysis chamber, the tar
will combust. Conversely, if the temperature is too low, the
transformation will not occur (Charters et al. 1993; Koller
et al. 2001: 393; Meijer and Pomstra 2011). In short, the procedure demands full control and the attention of the producer.
As such, we believe that it was unlikely that birch bark tar would
have been regularly produced by Neanderthals by accident.
Currently, no pre-ceramic tar-extraction structures are
known, yet fire remains from the Neanderthal site of Abric
Romaní, in Capellades, Spain (70,000–40,000 Cal BP), have
shown a presence of liquid hydrocarbons, interpreted as fuel,
but not a by-product of the predominantly coniferous wood
(Courty et al. 2012). Furthermore, the flat sandstone pebble
from Inden-Altdorf may have been involved in the production
and collection of tar (Pawlik and Thissen 2011b).
The questions remain as to what Neanderthal technology
could create birch bark tar and would such a production event
have occurred without leaving any archaeological trace? We
sought to tackle these questions experimentally, as the second
part of a series of experiments that started in 2009 (Groom
et al. 2015).
The distillation and production of birch bark tar using one
or two vessels is well documented (e.g. Piotrowski 1999;
Pollard and Heron 2008: 246ff; Groom et al. 2015); birch bark
tar can be easily produced using a double-pot or single-pot
method. A double-pot method involves a fire-resistant,
oxygen-excluding pot that is full of birch bark; this is placed
directly over another pot that is dug into the ground to catch
the tar. Ceramic flower pots are often used as the top-pot, the
lid of the top-pot is sealed and any gap between this and the
lower pot is insulated, either with sand or clay. This is to
prevent combustion as the tar runs from the bark in the toppot, down through the hole in the flower pot base and into the
lower pot. A fire is lit around the top-pot, being careful not to
knock the top-pot and expose the lower pot. Using this method, we have produced birch bark tar in 15 min. A single-pot
method involves the distillation of bark in a single container,
often a metal can. The container requires a ventilation hole to
allow for the evaporation of volatiles. If the bark in the can is
not totally charred, the product is a ready-to-use adhesive.
However, given that the pyrolysis of the bark has occurred
in one container, any tar produced tends to be contaminated
with charred bark.
As of yet, few researchers have experimented with
aceramic tar production. Those who have achieved tar without
air-excluding containers have either not published their experiments, rely on de facto containers or structures (that if used in

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2018) 10:19–29

Prehistory are likely to have left distinct archaeological trace)
or have not necessarily produced tar as such (Czarnowski and
Neubauer 1992; Osipowicz 2005; Palmer 2007). Most often,
the amount produced is very small (e.g. Meijer and Pomstra
2011).

Experiments, series 1: summary
The first series of experiments (series 1) took place in 2009.
Series 1 attempted to simplify the technical method of birch
bark tar production to explore the possible production
methods available to pre-ceramic societies (Groom et al.
2015; Schenck 2011). Though series 1 proved unsuccessful
at producing useable tar, we regularly achieved charring of the
birch bark and produced several tarry residues. As such, results from these initial experiments suggested a model for the
second series of experiments, where simple raised structures
could be used.

Methods and materials—pyrolysis in simple raised
structures
Series 2 was a series of exploratory experiments, where the
results of one dictated the parameters of the next. The initial
aim of the research was to find a way of creating birch bark tar
by using the simplest means possible. This would not only
provide us with an answer to this question but would also
establish whether a Neanderthal birch bark tar production
event could have occurred without leaving any significant
archaeological trace. We decided to simulate a possible
Neanderthal combustion surface using a roll of bark from
Betula pubescens (downy birch), sand and firewood. As such,
the size of the combustion surface including the structures was
based on some of the known hearth sizes of Neanderthal origin (Preece et al. 2006; Roebroeks and Villa 2011; Vallverdú
et al. 2012: 2, 7; Aldeias et al. 2012: 2415; Mentzer 2012).
We focussed on simple raised structures, since pits (see
Groom et al. 2015) appeared to be unsuccessful due to apparent insufficient heat penetration from the fire, downwards into
the pit through the soil cover, compounded by the lack of an
enveloping heat source. The idea was to create raised structures in order to surround the bark pyrolysis chamber with as
much heat as possible. Therefore, the simple structures in
series 2 were designed as small sand mounds which could
be encircled by a fire.
We had been fortunate enough to have seen some of the
archaeological samples of Betula sp. bark rolls from the
Mesolithic site of Star Carr, Yorkshire, England. Based on
these, we used small tight rolls of B. pubescens bark c.10 cm
long and c.5 cm wide in the series 2 experiments.

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2018) 10:19–29

To ensure that the raised structures had matching foundations for all experiments, a c.5-cm-deep layer of building sand
(Diall’s building sand with grits) was used as a base; this lay
on top of the underlying quartzite gravel. Observations from
series 1 demonstrated that sand tended to set hard during the
firing; therefore, no cementing agent would be necessary to
maintain the stability of the structures.
To be successful, the simple raised structures would need to
withstand the necessary heat penetration for bark pyrolysis yet
provide airtight conditions to prevent bark combustion. With
reference to conventional bark tar production methods, a small
mound of sand could create similar conditions to a single-pot
structure, although the sand mound structures were not designed with vents as is often done with double-pot or singlepot methods to encourage volatile evaporation (e.g. Weiner
2005: 26). In one sense, a mound of sand is the simplest form
of kiln. The sand mound encloses the object to be heated, in
this case, a roll of birch bark, the temperature in the bark
chamber is increased by using an external heat source, in this
case a wood fire.
The experiments were conducted outdoors in October 2013
and were sheltered from frequent heavy rain by a tarpaulin.
Although the site was not particularly exposed to the wind, a
good breeze was present on most days which helped both to
fan the fire and raise the temperature of the fire. Fires were
built so that they surrounded the mounds, and the fuel used
was pine (Pinus sylvestris) logs or sticks, therefore reducing
the chances of contamination of the birch bark chamber by use
of a hardwood fuel such as birch.
As the temperature of an outdoor wood fire can vary between several hundred degrees within the same fire, particularly when the wind is multidirectional, this creates a problem
with temperature control (Gosselain 1992). Such variables are
common when undertaking actualistic experimental archaeology in the field, often giving rise to uncertain interpretations;
where possible, we attempted to mitigate against these variables by the use of scientific recording instruments.
F o r m e a s u r e m e n t , a J e n w a y 2 2 0 Te m p M e t e r
Thermocouple and a handheld anemometer with integrated
thermometer from LaCrosse Technologies were used at 10min intervals for recording the bark chamber temperature and
wind speed, respectively; ambient air temperatures were measured at 30-min intervals. The experiments were documented
throughout using digital photography and drawings.

Results
The first experiment in series 2 sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a simple raised structure.
Experiment 1 consisted of a simple mound of sand 5 cm
thick covering a horizontal roll of B. pubescens bark c.10 cm
long and c.5 cm wide (Fig. 1, for details see Table 1).

21

Fig. 1 Experiment 1. Constructing the initial mound of sand that became
the model for later experiments 3 to 6. This consisted of placing the 5-cmdiameter roll of the bark flat on the sand then heaping damp sand around
it. The mound was built up to the required depth of sand, in this case 5 cm

For this initial experiment, (Fig. 2) temperatures were not
monitored; this prevented accidental disturbance of the structure by use of the thermocouple. After 20 min of extensive fire
cover, tar odour could be detected; tar odour was a feature we
encountered consistently during the experiments in series 1,
and is usually indicative of the release of tar volatiles (Groom
et al. 2015). The fire was maintained and burned for a further
2 h and 40 min. Experiment 1 was one of only two experiments in series 2 where we ended the fire based on intuition;
experiments 3 to 5 were terminated after the appropriate temperatures had been achieved for pyrolysis to have succeeded
(c.320 °C thermocouple reading).
Upon excavation, it became evident that pyrolysis of the
birch bark roll had occurred as the sand around the bark roll
chamber was black with tar and had baked/solidified to c.3 cm
away from roll. It was therefore obvious that the heat from the
fire was sufficient to pass through the 5-cm cover of sand. The
bark roll was intact and almost exclusively affected on the top
surface (Fig. 3), presumably due to the proximity of the fiercest and most sustained part of the fire. Upon opening the bark
roll, several layers were fused together by a glossy burnt tar. In
order to produce a more even heat distribution into the bark
chamber, the structure size was decreased in subsequent experiments to allow for full envelopment by the fire; however,
the dimensions of the bark roll were consistent (length 10 cm,
diameter 5 cm).
Experiment 2 was not a raised structure and is therefore
excluded from this paper. Experiment 3 was a simultaneous
double firing of two raised structures (Fig. 4). Of the two,
structure 3a was the first simple raised mound in which temperature data was recorded. Since heat penetration appeared to
have been the primary obstacle during the pit firings of series
1 (Groom et al. 2015), experiment 3 was designed to explore
the minimum layer of sand that would be required to produce
tar, while protecting the bark from combustion. Theoretically,
the thinnest cover of sand possible would be the most economical choice in terms of wood fuel efficiency as it would

require less fuel to generate the heat necessary to pyrolyse the
bark roll within the mound. However, too thin, a cover of sand
could collapse due to fuel wood movement during burning
and potential thermal stress.
Based on observations from series 1 and the initial experiment 1, 3a was constructed with a 5-cm cover of sand and 3b
with a 3-cm cover of sand. The reason for the difference in
thickness of sand was to deliberately test the limits of the
cover of sand. The thermocouple was inserted through a copper tube into the base of the bark chamber in the 5-cm mound
(3a), leaving a gap of <1 cm from the base of the bark roll to
prevent tar contamination of the thermocouple sensor. To prevent air ingress into the thermocouple tube, the outlet was
covered with gravel and sand. The thermocouple was used
in 3a because the temperature recordings taken from the base
of this mound would be the minimum for the two mounds
given that the sand cover in 3b was 2 cm less and, therefore,
the heat penetration was expected to be more effective through
the 3-cm cover. A fire was then built around both structures.
Throughout the experiment, the temperature at the base of
the bark chamber in 3a rose steadily (Table 1 ), with occasional plateaus. The experiment was terminated after 4 h when

Fig. 4 Experiment 3. Right: 3a (5-cm sand cover T). Left: 3b (3-cm sand
cover T)

liquid tar from mound 3a began trickling through and along
the thermocouple tube (Fig. 5), at a temperature of 320 °C, an
obvious indicator that pyrolysis had occurred.
Upon excavation of the mounds and examination of the bark
remains, 3a was glossy and slightly charred; however, 3b was
black, very charred and had no tar residue. We assume that any
tar produced in 3b had combusted due to the thinner 3-cm sand
cover and likely higher temperature of the bark chamber. Both
bark chambers were surrounded by blackened sand to a distance of c.3–4 cm and both chamber walls were baked/solidified, probably due to heat (Henderson 2000: 132–133).
Experiment 4 was designed to investigate the further effectiveness of the 3-cm sand cover used in 3b and to test whether
such a thin cover of sand could produce tar yet remain sound.
Based on the accidental experience of tar spill in 3a, a copper
run-off tube was introduced into the base of the bark chamber
of 4 to provide a means of run-off for any tar produced. This
was deemed necessary as the experiments at this stage were
not concerned with catchment methods and the tar appeared to
be running off into the sand or combusting. In order to prevent
another unintentional run-off of tar into the thermocouple
tube, this was placed at a slight incline from the base of the
bark chamber, whereas the tar run-off tube declined away
from the chamber. As a collector for the tar, a small sheet of
lime (Tilia cordata) bark was placed at the outlet. Finally, to
prevent air ingress into both tubes, the outlets were covered
with gravel and sand.
Experiment 4 (Fig. 6) was the slowest firing of the simple
raised structures at 5 h and 10 min, weather conditions of mist,
rain and 87 % humidity limited the fierceness of the fire. The fire
was left to die down once the temperature of 317 °C was
reached.
Upon excavation, it was confirmed that tar had collected in
the run-off tube, but had unfortunately soaked through the

lime bark sheet and into the soil to a depth of c.4 cm, though
this was difficult to verify accurately due to the substrate. The
structure displayed blackened baked/solidified walls and
blackened sand immediately surrounding the bark chamber,
which lessened with increasing distance from the site of the
bark roll to a distance of c.2–5 cm (Fig. 7).
Experiment 5 was again designed as a simultaneous double
firing of two raised structures following the template of 3.
However, on this occasion, the thermocouple was inserted into
the base of the bark chamber in the 3-cm sand-covered mound
(5b). For this experiment, glass jars were used as tar collectors
and were linked to both bark chambers using copper tubes. As
the glass jars had to be protected from the heat of the fire, they
were covered with a layer of sand and a small bank of sand
between the jars and the fire (Fig. 8). This slightly limited the
fire in that it would not completely surround the mounds as in
the previous experiments. The thermocouple tube was again
placed at a slight incline from the base of the bark chamber, as
this had proved successful in the previous experiment. Finally,
to prevent air ingress into all three tubes, the outlets were
covered with gravel and sand.
In 5b, the temperature at the base of the bark chamber
increased rapidly, possibly aided by less humid conditions
and an average wind speed of 0.5 m/s (Table 1). The chamber
reached 321 °C after only 2 h and 10 min, upon which the
feeding of the fire stopped and die-down was allowed.

Fig. 6 Experiment 4 after firing, a mix of wood ash, charred bark and
sand. Note: a house brick was used as a camera stand during excavation

Measurements of temperatures continued until 5 h had passed,
in order to record the declining temperature (Fig. 15).
Upon excavation, it was clear that both mounds had produced tar as the sand surrounding the bark chamber was black
(Fig. 9) and tar had collected in both jars (e.g. Fig. 10). Both
bark rolls were very charred but intact and the bark chamber
walls were black and baked/solidified (Fig. 11) resembling all
previous experiments in series 2.
Experiment 6 was the final experiment of series 2. Given
that the sand mounds had proven successful in producing tar,
the natural extension to the results so far obtained in series 2
was to include a collector in the mound itself. In addition, this
final experiment simultaneously compared four different
methods in one fire (Fig. 12), the methods were as follows:
1. Single-pot (metal can with hole pierced in lid)
2. Four birch branches placed beneath the sand under the fire
3. Sand mound (3-cm sand cover) with a scallop shell
(Pecten maximus) at the base of the bark chamber to hold
the bark roll and collect any tar produced

4. Double-pot (ceramic plant pot on surface and metal can
buried as collector)
The use of four methods in one fire meant that the environmental conditions were the same for all; furthermore, the
double- and single-pot methods would act as a control. No
recording equipment was used; in this way, the management
of the fire would rely on the recognition of tar smell rather
than thermocouple readings. The length of the combustion
surface was c.50 cm and the width c.35 cm.
The fire was started at 4.45 pm, and the first odour of tar came
from the mound and double-pot at 6 pm; the feeding of the fire
stopped at this point. The single-pot was placed into the hot ashes
at 5.45 pm and white vapour and tar began emitting from the hole
in the lid at 6.15 pm. The fire had burnt out naturally by 7 pm.
As expected, the single-pot method produced thickened tar
which included small pieces of charred bark; however, this did
not appear to limit the adhesive properties.
The double-pot method produced liquid tar, free from any
charred bark. Though clearly affected by the heat and burnt in
places, the birch branches showed no signs of pyrolysis or tar,
despite another experimental attempt. The sand mound produced tar that collected in the scallop shell, and the shell
showed no sign of burning (Fig. 13).

In order to investigate how liquid birch bark tar could be
thickened, a common otter shell (Lutraria lutraria) was later
placed in hot ashes and was used to simmer the liquid tar
reducing it to a thicker, more viscous state (Fig. 14).
Figure 15 represents all tar-yielding experiments where recordings were taken (3a, 4, and 5b) which reached a minimum
temperature in the vicinity of 320 °C. For consistency, the
dimensions of the bark roll were roughly the same in all experiments c.10 cm in length and c.5 cm diameter (though the
volume of bark differed slightly due to the shape and tension
of the bark). This meant that once sand had covered the bark
roll, the bark chamber in all of the experiments had an internal
height of approximately 5 cm (the diameter of the bark roll
itself). Therefore, the thermocouple sensor was only 5 cm
away from the chamber ceiling, a maximum of 10 cm away
from the fire and a minimum of 8 cm from the fire.
Unfortunately, the temperature difference between the chamber ceiling and the base of the chamber is unknown, as the
thermocouple was always placed at the base of the chamber,
presumably measuring minimum temperatures only. An additional thermocouple placed on the mound surface would have
measured the temperature at the base of the fire. This would
have been useful in determining the temperature required at
the base of the fire to cause pyrolysis in the bark chamber
under the sand below. Some of the mound experiments could
technically be classed as double-vessel types, due to the use of
catchment tubes and external containers (in 3a the thermocouple tube itself), and in this way, the tar produced was unpolluted by char and sediment; however, the sand mound in experiment 6 resembled a single-pot method, with its integral
shell collector.
Overall, the temperatures in the bark chambers of the friable sand mounds were sufficient to produce a clean tar, particularly when collection tubes and jars were used. For a summary of recorded data, see Table 1.

Discussion
The aim of the series 2 experiments was to simulate a possible
Neanderthal combustion surface on which to create birch bark

The discourse on Middle Palaeolithic pyrotechnology is
extensive; Mentzer (2012: 21, Table 3) documents fire activities with evidence of anthropogenic reworking. Examples
include Kebara Cave (Israel), La Quina Rockshelter (France)
and Pech de l’Azé Cave (France). Similarly, at Roc de Marsal,
France, reworking of combustion features may be evidence of
hearth cleaning (Aldeias et al. 2012). Another site that may
provide evidence of the controlled use of fire is Beeches Pit,
Suffolk, UK, dating to 414 000 ± 30 000 BP, where shallow
burnt depressions are interpreted as hearths that imply a sequence of burning (Preece et al. 2006: 491). At Abric Romaní,
Roebroeks and Villa (2011) report 187 combustion structures
throughout the levels of the site. Furthermore, the combustion
structures display repeated use (Vallverdú et al. 2012: 9).
Fireplaces have yielded mineralogical evidence of a production of liquid hydrocarbon that may be connected to heating in
a reducing atmosphere (Courty et al. 2012: 309); this could be
evidence of slow pyrolysis. The geological/stratigraphical dating for this site was c.70–40,000 BP, the same approximate
period that the tar pieces at Königsaue were produced. Courty
et al. (2012) proposed that the combustion structures indicate a
variety of specific firing activities (Ibid. 295, 309). As experiment 6 in series 2 clearly demonstrates, a skilled practitioner
can pyrolyse birch bark and produce tar using only the simplest of materials and a sense of smell; therefore, birch bark tar
production seems to be a task that could fit with the interpretations at Abric Romaní. The series 2 experiments produced
only small amounts of tar; however, the production of large
amounts was not the remit of these experiments. Based on the
series 2 method, further experiments could determine how
larger amounts of birch bark tar could be made and explore
potential collectors. These experiments would of course have
to be conducted within the parameters of known Middle
Palaeolithic technologies and archaeological evidence (as
were series 2). Whether the small amounts of tar produced
in series 2 accurately reflect the amounts produced during

Middle Palaeolithic birch bark production events is difficult
to answer. For example, would such activities in the Middle
Palaeolithic have been conducted at the hearth in the ‘living
area’, or would the acrid smell of the pyrolysing birch bark
have driven the process ‘off-site’ or outside? Furthermore, if
the production event did take place within the living area,
perhaps the availability of fuel wood limited the sizes of fires,
so that only small amounts of birch bark tar could be produced. The crucial point here being that a minimum temperature in the vicinity of 250 °C must have been achieved in order
to create the birch bark tar that we see on the archaeological
artefacts outlined earlier. Alternatively, could sampling bias be
the reason why we have little evidence for large-scale production methods? Where would we look and what would we look
for?

from the jar’s almost horizontal position in the ground. This photo was
taken 2 weeks after the experiments and some of the viscous tar still clings

Mentzer (2012) discussed archaeological fire remains,
looking specifically at microarchaeological techniques to aid
identification and interpretation of activities. Combustion
structure experiments conducted by Mallol et al. (2013a:10)
demonstrated however that many anthropogenic activities associated with Middle Palaeolithic fires may be undetected.
Every sand mound in series 2 contained a baked/solidified
black sand layer surrounding the bark pyrolysis chamber. It
may be that this was caused by a combination of heat and
volatile tar spreading into the sand, though the sand covering
each mound was unaffected and was still largely friable. This
baked/solidified black sand layer is interesting as this is obviously a product of the firing process, though whether it occurred early or late in the pyrolysis event is unknown. In future
experiments, it would be of great benefit to ascertain which, as
if the baking/solidification of the bark chamber walls occurs
early on then it may be that this mimics the protective environment of a ceramic pot.

Many Middle Palaeolithic combustion structures display
black layers; for further discussion of the interpretation of
black layers, see Mallol et al. (2013b). Whether the tar products of our sand mound fires are similar to Neanderthal examples is part of our ongoing research. We have already analysed
the tar samples produced in series 2 and these will be the
subject of our next paper. Future research could involve
high-resolution analysis to compare the blackened hearth sediments produced by our series 2 method, with samples from
Palaeolithic hearths. This, together with the analysis and comparison of the tar and residues produced using the series 2
method, with those obtained from Middle Palaeolithic contexts, would go some way to resolving just how birch bark
tar was produced in the Middle Palaeolithic.
As Mallol et al. (2013b: 2516) state, most Middle
Palaeolithic combustion structures are flat; with reference to
the raised mounds in series 2, once the sand cover has been
brushed aside and the pyrolysed bark and the tar collector
have been removed, the surface is again flat (see Fig. 7).
Should the combustion structures at Abric Romaní, or similar structures elsewhere, be proven to be connected to birch
bark tar production, this would lend support to the notion that
Neanderthals could control fire (e.g. Roebroeks and Villa

2011; Aldeias et al. 2012). Some writers (e.g. Wadley 2010;
Pawlik and Thissen 2011a) consider the production of compound adhesives in the Middle Stone Age as being a proxy for
complex cognition. Indeed, in light of our experiments, we
propose that regular birch bark tar production by
Neanderthals is unlikely to have been a result of opportunistic
accident, but was rather a result of specific chaînes
opératoires in order to provide the necessary control and
outcomes.

Conclusions
The experiments in series 2 produced several results that are
highly relevant for the discourse on Palaeolithic birch bark tar
production:
1. Birch bark tar production is not difficult once the skill set
is learnt
2. A crucial competence in the production of birch bark tar is
to assess how long it takes for pyrolysis to occur so that
the fire can be terminated to prevent the tar from
combusting. This can be determined with some accuracy
by detecting the occurrence of tar odour (volatile evaporation) through smell alone, then managing the fire
accordingly
3. It is not necessary to build or create a complex structure to
produce birch bark tar. Rather, a simple mound of sand
covering a roll of bark will suffice
4. A suitable collector, such as a shell placed under the bark
roll, is sufficient to capture any tar produced
5. After firing, all sand structures displayed a blackened layer surrounding the bark chamber while the bark chamber
walls were baked/solidified. This is interesting and demonstrates that as the sand hardens during the firing process, it is close to mimicking the protective environment
of a ceramic pot
6. The photographic documentation of each structure during
creation and excavation provides a potential catalogue of
reference for the interpretation of archaeological fire
events
The experiments in series 2 lead us to propose that regular
birch bark tar production by Neanderthals was easily achievable and the product of specific chaînes opératoires in order to
provide control of the pyrolysis event.
Based on these experiments, we can now with some confidence present a potential scenario for the initial production
of birch bark tar in the Middle Palaeolithic, one where multiuse hearths on which activities such as cooking, heating etc.
occur. In the margins of the hearth adjacent to the fire, under
piles of swept sand and ash, pieces of birch bark that were
used in the initial fire lighting, accidentally pyrolyse and

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2018) 10:19–29

produce volatile vapour, oil and tar. An observant
Neanderthal acknowledges the strange smell and later notices
the product. Then, by finding a suitable container/collector
and by placing this and rolls of bark under sand mounds at
the edge of the hearth, a fire is lit and birch bark tar is intentionally produced.
