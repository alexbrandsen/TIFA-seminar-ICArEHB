This paper presents the ﬁrst study that combines the use of ancient crop and animal stable isotopes
(carbon and nitrogen) and Zooarchaeology Mass Spectrometry species identiﬁcation (ZooMS) for
reconstructing early farming practices at Kouphovouno, a MiddleeLate Neolithic village in southern
Greece (c. 5950e4500 cal. BC). Debate surrounding the nature of early farming predominantly revolves
around the intensity of crop cultivation: did early farmers move around the landscape while practicing
temporary farming methods such as slash and burn agriculture or did they create more permanent ﬁelds
by investing high labor inputs into smaller pieces of land that produced higher crop yields? The need to
address these questions using a direct assessment of the intensity and scale of cultivation is apparent,
and an integrated stable isotope approach provides such an opportunity. The results of this study support
the model of small-scale mixed farming, where crop cultivation and animal husbandry are closely integrated. The farmers directed their intensive management towards crops grown for human consumption (free-threshing wheat), while growing fodder crop (hulled barley) more extensively. Pulses were
cultivated under a high-manuring/high-watering regime, likely in garden plots in rotation with freethreshing wheat. The diets of the livestock enable us to investigate which parts of the landscape were
used for browsing and grazing and indicate that animal management changed in the Late Neolithic. The
sheep and goats were now kept in smaller numbers and grazed together and new pasture grasses may
have been sought for the grazing of cattle. This study demonstrates that beyond its applicability for
palaeodietary reconstruction, analysis of stable isotopes of archaeological crop and animal remains has
important implications for understanding the relationship between humans, plants and animals in an
archaeological context.

1. Introduction
Recent investigations in the ﬁeld of stable isotope analysis have
demonstrated the potential of obtaining direct evidence of ancient
agricultural practices from d15N and d13C analysis of archaeobotanical remains (Araus et al., 1997, 1999; Bogaard et al., 2007,
2013; Fraser et al., 2011, 2013a; Kanstrup et al., 2011, 2012, in press;

farming regimes has shown that d15N and d13C values reﬂect crop
growing conditions, such as soil nitrogen composition and crop
water availability. In addition, some of this work (Bogaard et al., 2007,
2013; Fraser et al., 2011, 2013a, 2013b; Lightfoot and Stevens, 2012)
has highlighted the fact that where possible, the isotopes of plants
must be measured alongside the isotopes of human and faunal remains in order to better understand ancient palaeodiets.
The current paper builds on this work by integrating the analysis
of ancient crop and faunal remains in order to explore the nature of
agricultural economy at the MiddleeLate Neolithic site of Kouphovouno (5950e4500 cal. BC). It has long been argued that
management of domestic plants and animals in a farming context

202

P. Vaiglova et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 42 (2014) 201e215

can be functionally interdependent (Bogaard, 2004a, 2004b, 2005;
Bogaard and Isaakidou, 2010; Byrd, 2000; Flannery, 1969; Halstead,
1989). Animals can be used to regulate and promote crop productivity as well as for “indirect storage” of surplus grain and crops/
arable ﬁelds can serve as fodder and graze for the animals. In light
of this view, it has been suggested that early farming systems in
Greece, and in fact the rest of Europe, employed some version of a
small-scale mixed farming economy (Bogaard, 2004a, 2004b, 2005;
Halstead, 1996, 2000, 2006). Thus, the aim of this paper is to
investigate if the stable isotope data support or refute an intensive
mixed farming model and if the changes in pottery styles observed
between the Middle and Late Neolithic were accompanied by shifts
in agricultural management.

2. Methodological background
Stable isotope signatures of archaeological material (such as
bone collagen or charred plant material) are useful for reconstructing not only past human and animal diets, but practices such
as land use and agricultural management (for examples of palaeodietary studies, see Chisholm et al., 1982; Richards et al., 2003;
Schulting and Richards, 2002; Schwarcz et al., 1985). The stable
isotope values of carbon and nitrogen, expressed as d13C and d15N,
represent the ratios of the heavier to lighter isotopes (13C:12C and
15 14
N: N) in a given sample compared to internationally set standards (PeeDee Belemnite for carbon and AIR for nitrogen). The ratios are expressed in parts per thousand, &, and are calculated
using the following equation:
13

d13 Cstandard

For a comprehensive review of the technique, see Lee-Thorp
(2008), O’Connell and Hedges (1999), Schoeninger and Moore
(1992), Schwarcz and Schoeninger (1991).
Plants and animals obtain carbon and nitrogen through metabolic
processes such as breathing, photosynthesis and digestion. These
processes are governed by principles of biochemical fractionation
that determine the proportions in which the different isotopes of
each element get assimilated into the organisms' tissues (such as
animal muscles/bones, and crop grain/straw). When another organism consumes those tissues, the isotope chemistry of the consumer reﬂects the distinct signature of the food source plus an
enrichment factor. Thus, herbivores have higher d15N and to a lesser
extent d13C compared to the plant foods they consume and carnivores
have higher values than the herbivores they eat (Bocherens et al.,
1995; Chisholm et al., 1982; DeNiro and Epstein, 1978; Hedges,
2006; Hedges and Reynard, 2007; Lee-Thorp et al., 1989; Sillen
et al., 1989; Vogel and van der Merwe, 1977). Collagen d13C and d15N
values predominantly reﬂect the protein portion of the consumers’
diets (Ambrose and Norr, 1993; Chisholm et al., 1982), with many
amino acids being directly assimilated from the food source
(Chikaraishi et al., 2009; Corr et al., 2005; McCullagh et al., 2006).
The d15N of crops reﬂects the isotopic composition of their nitrogen source. N2-ﬁxers, such as lentils and other pulses, host Rhizobium
bacteria in the nodules of their roots, which convert atmospheric
nitrogen to ammonium ions and pass them to the plant or surrounding soil. This process does not cause substantial fractionation
and as a result, N2-ﬁxers have d15N values closer to the value of atmospheric nitrogen, which is 0& (Bernhard, 2012; Delwiche et al.,
1979; Högberg, 1997). Non-N2-ﬁxers, such as cereals, obtain their
nitrogen from the soil and are thus directly affected by the factors that
cause soil 15N enrichment discussed below (Bogaard et al., 2007;
Fraser et al., 2011; Kanstrup et al., 2011, in press). Although in

traditional farming contexts, N2-ﬁxers ﬁx mostly atmospheric nitrogen, they are also affected by manuring, albeit to a lesser extent than
non-N2-ﬁxers (Fraser et al., 2011). A possible mechanism for this is
direct uptake of amino acids present in soil (as has been found to be
the case in the non-leguminous wheat (Hill et al., 2011)).
Soil 15N enrichment can be caused by natural factors such as soil
salinity (Ambrose, 1991; Heaton, 1987; although for opposite
argument see Yousﬁ et al., 2010), sea-spray of nitrates (Heaton,
1987; Virginia and Delwiche, 1982), and denitriﬁcation (Högberg,
1997; Tiedje et al., 1982). Signiﬁcant denitriﬁcation occurs in
waterlogged conditions such as marshlands. Elevated d15N values
have also been correlated with decreased precipitation in experimental and ﬁeld studies in arid regions in South Africa, the
southwestern United States, Namibia, and the Kenya Rift Valley
(Ambrose, 1991; Evans and Ehleringer, 1993, 1994; Heaton, 1987;
Heaton et al., 1986; Lopes and Araus, 2006; Sealy et al., 1987;
Swap et al., 2004). Aranibar et al. (2004) observed an aridity effect across a precipitation gradient (978e230 mm of annual rainfall) in the Kalahari desert, but argue that 15N enrichment in arid
climates may be more affected by unpredictability of precipitation
rather than lower overall annual rainfall levels. Fraser et al. (2011)
assert that the aridity effect may be buffered through crop management and therefore invisible in agricultural settings.
Anthropogenic factors that cause 15N enrichment include middenning (cf Guttmann, 2005; Bogaard, 2012), manuring (Bogaard
et al., 2007; Fraser et al., 2011; Kanstrup et al., 2011, in press),
clear-cutting of forests (Pardo et al., 2002) and burning of fossil
fuels (Templer et al., 2007).
d15N from animal and human collagen can be used to assess the
trophic level of the individual, which is an indication of where the
individual was situated in the food chain (DeNiro and Epstein, 1981;
Hedges and Reynard, 2007; Minagawa and Wada, 1984). For many
years, the widely accepted value for isotopic spacing between diet
and consumer tissue has been 3e5& (Ambrose, 2000; Bocherens
and Drucker, 2003; Hedges and Reynard, 2007), but recent work
on isotope spacing in humans by O’Connell et al. (2012) suggests
that this value may be higher, between 4.6 and 6&. Taking all of this
work into account and assuming that trophic enrichment for
humans is comparable to that for domestic animals, in this study,
we use 5  1& as an approximation of tissue-diet spacing.
Plant d13C values are determined by the d13C of atmospheric CO2
at the time of the plant’s growth as well as the degree of fractionation that occurs during photosynthesis. Since the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has ﬂuctuated over time, differences
in plant d13C values from different periods do not simply reﬂect
growing conditions and fractionation, but the isotopic composition
of the carbon source as well. For this reason, when comparing crop
d13C across different periods, the values need to be converted into
D13C, which reﬂect the carbon isotope discrimination independent
of atmospheric CO2 concentration (Farquhar et al., 1982, 1989;
Jackson et al., 1994; Wallace et al., 2013). The conversion is done
following the principles outlined by Farquhar et al. (1989) and using
the equation:

13

D Cð&Þ ¼

d13 Cair  d13 Cplant

!

13

1 þ d Cplant

d13Cair is the isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 at the time
that the plant was growing. Its values have been preserved in
sequence in Antarctic ice-cores and can be estimated using the
AIRCO2_LOESS data calibrator1 for the time period between 16,100

B.C.E. and 2003 C.E. (Cleveland, 1979; Ferrio et al., 2005; Francey
et al., 1999; Indermühle et al., 1999; Lauenberger et al., 1992).
Converting d13C into D13C changes the directionality of the effect
(i.e. higher d13C values equate to lower D13C values), and the sign
(negative d13C values become positive).
Carbon isotope discrimination in plants, encoded in their D13C,
is driven by the photosynthetic mechanism. Many factors are
involved in this process (including light intensity, temperature, and
concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere), but it is argued that in
semi-arid climates, D13C is most notably affected by water availability (Farquhar et al., 1982, 1989; Farquhar and Richards, 1984;
Wallace et al., 2013). The amount of water available controls the
action of the plant stomata (pores on the surface of the plants),
which affects how the CO2 is used during photosynthesis. When
sufﬁcient amounts of water are available, the plant stomata stay
open for longer periods of time and CO2 is replenished during
photosynthesis so that more of the lighter 12C (which reacts more
quickly in chemical reactions) is available for assimilation. When
the water supply is limited, the plant periodically closes its stomata
to conserve the water. This causes the CO2 to be recycled and more
of the heavier 13C to be assimilated (Farquhar et al., 1982, 1989;
O’Leary, 1981; Smith et al., 1976; Wallace et al., 2013). Measurement of D13C of crops is thus instrumental for inferring the water
status of the crops during their growth season.
3. The site
Kouphovouno is located in mainland southern Greece, c. 2.5 km
southwest of Sparta on the Peloponnesian peninsula (see Fig. 1).
The site was ﬁrst occupied in the Middle Neolithic, which, in
Southern Greece is dated to c. 5950e5450 cal. BC, and continued
through the Late Neolithic (c. 5450e4500 cal BC). Based on AMS
radiocarbon dating of seeds from the same contexts, the strata
represented in this study date to a narrower range of c. 5800e
5000 cal. BC (Mee et al., 2013) (Fig. 2).
First excavation of the site was undertaken by OeW. von Vacano
in 1941 and this work was published by Josette Renard in 1989. The
initially exposed strata indicated that the site had been occupied

203

between the Middle Neolithic and the Early Helladic II periods. The
site was reopened in 2001 after two seasons of survey, which
indicated that a number of burnt structures lay buried under the
surface and that the extent of occupation of the site did not vary
signiﬁcantly between the Middle and the Late Neolithic (Cavanagh
et al., 2004, 2007; Mee et al., 2013).
A further ﬁve seasons of excavation recovered well-preserved
botanical and faunal assemblages across the excavated Areas AeG
in contexts ranging from burnt ﬂoors and hearth structures to
destruction layers and midden deposits. The available archaeology
indicates that the settlement was nucleated and may have been
divided into neighborhoods. The plant assemblage mostly consists
of domestic species of cereals and pulses including free-threshing
wheat, hulled barley, (one-seeded) einkorn, emmer, lentil, common pea, grass pea, and bitter vetch; along with ﬁgs and ﬂax. The
faunal assemblage is dominated by domestic animals such as cattle,
sheep, goats, pigs and dogs, but wild animals such as red deer, roe
deer, wild boar, aurochs, wild goat, hare, wolf, fox, cat and weasel
were also found in smaller quantities (Cantuel et al., 2008;
Cavanagh et al., 2004; Gardeisen, 2007).
The surrounding Sparta Basin is one of the most fertile regions
in Greece, and ample arable land was available for cultivation in the
Neolithic. The early farmers may have sown their crops in the
ﬂoodplain on which the tell sits, on alluvial fans located 300 m to
the west of the site and/or on unoccupied parts of the tell itself. The
environment also offered land suitable for animal grazing/browsing
and plentiful drainage from nearby rivers (Fouache et al., 2007;
section by James and Kousoulakou in Cavanagh et al., 2004).
4. Materials and methods
4.1. Choice of samples
28 bulk samples of charred archaeobotanical material were
analyzed in this study. They include 13 samples of free-threshing
wheat grain (Triticum aestivum L./Triticum durum Desf.), 7 samples of hulled barley grain (Hordeum vulgare L.), 7 samples of
common pea (Pisum sativum L.) and 1 sample of lentil (Lens culinaris

Medik.). Other species recovered in the archaeobotanical record
(Bogaard unpublished data) include wheat of the hulled variety,
einkorn (Triticum monococcum L.) and emmer (Triticum dicoccum
Shrank); these were recovered in smaller quantities, however, and
could not be included in the isotope sampling.
68 samples of animal bone were analyzed in this study. These
include 15 samples of domestic cattle (Bos taurus), 7 dogs (Canis
lupus familiaris), 12 domestic sheep (Ovis aries), 7 domestic goats
(Capra hircus), 23 domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), 1 wild boar
(Sus scrofa scrofa), 1 hare (Lepus europaeus), 1 bear (Ursus arctos) and
1 sample of wild goat (Capra aegagrus/Capra ibex).
See Inline Supplementary Table S1 for details on the archaeological context of the samples. Due to the limited number of samples, we have grouped them only into two chronological phases:
Middle Neolithic and Late Neolithic. Elsewhere, some of these
contexts are discussed to be Transitional MN/LN (Mee et al. in
press). In this study, the transitional contexts are treated as Late
Neolithic due to the occurrence of Black Ware pottery, which is
taken to signal the onset of the Late Neolithic.
Inline Supplementary Table S1 can be found online at http://dx.
doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2013.10.023.
4.2. Wild vs. domestic plants
Most of the samples analyzed in this study represent domestic
forms of plants and animals. While it would be useful to have a
large sample size of wild animals for comparison, the 1 sample of
bear, 1 sample of hare, 1 sample of wild goat and 1 sample of wild
boar were all that was available from the wild faunal assemblage.
As for the crops, there are two reasons why we did not sample any
wild species. First, the only wild plant that is available in a usable
quantity from this site is ﬁg and measuring it would not provide us
with any useful information. It could not serve as a reference for the
“environmental background” as it is unknown where the ﬁg trees
grew. They may have been located adjacent to the ﬁelds and thus
been affected by arable management. Additionally, the isotopic
composition of this one species would not illustrate the diversity of
the isotopic composition of all the grasses and browse available for
the herbivores to consume. Second, we hesitate to measure the
stable isotopes of wild plant species, as these have not been studied
experimentally and so it is unknown how these plants respond to

charring and soil 15N enrichment. In light of these limitations, the
interpretations made in this study are primarily based on relative
differences between (predominantly domestic) species, and reference is made to forage values estimated from local herbivore
collagen.
4.3. Pretreatment
Pretreatment of the plant material followed an acid-base-acid
protocol described by Fraser et al. (2011). The samples were ﬁrst
soaked in 0.5 M HCl at 70  C for 30e60 min and subsequently
rinsed 3 times in distilled water. Next, they were soaked in 0.1 M
NaOH at 70  C for 60 min and rinsed as many times as it took to
wash out the brown humic substances (up to 9 rinses). Lastly, the
samples were heated in 0.5 M HCl at 70  C for 25 min and rinsed 3
times in distilled water. Kanstrup et al. (in press) used stronger acid
and base to pre-treat their archaeobotanical samples (1 M HCl and
1 M NaOH for 1 h, 3 h and 16 h). They found a difference of 0.9&
between their pre-treated and non-pretreated samples; however, it
remains to be determined whether this difference was solely due to
the removal of contamination or the use of more vigorous pretreatment.
Pre-treatment of the faunal material followed the standard
procedure for bone collagen extraction (modiﬁed Longin (1971)
method described by Richards and Hedges (1999)). Bone pieces
were demineralized using 0.5 M HCl at 5  C over a period of 3e10
days and subsequently washed three times in distilled water. The
residue was gelatinized in pH3 HCl solution for 48 h at 75  C and
subsequently freeze-dried.
4.4. Isotope measurements and precision
Measurements of plant d13C were performed at the NERC
Isotope Geosciences Laboratory on a Costech 4010 on-line to a VG
TripleTrap and Optima dual-inlet mass spectrometer. Measurements of plant d15N and faunal d13C and d15N were analyzed using
Continuous Flow Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (CFIRMS)
comprised of an Elemental analyser (Flash/EA) coupled to a Thermo
Finnigan DeltaPlus XL isotope ratio mass spectrometer via a ConFlo
III interface. Collagen d13C and d15N ratios were calibrated using
internal reference material M1360p (powdered gelatine from

P. Vaiglova et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 42 (2014) 201e215

British Drug Houses) with expected d13C values of 20.32& (calibrated against IAEA CH7) and þ8.12& (calibrated against IAEA N-1
and N-2) for C and N respectively. Plant d13C and d15N ratios were
calibrated using internal reference material BROC-2 (powdered
broccoli) with expected delta values of 27.48& (against NBS-18,
NBS-19 and NBS-22) and þ1.5& (calibrated against IAEA N-1 and
N-2) for C and N respectively.
The precision (1s) of the collagen results, based on the reproducibility of the gelatin standard measured six times within each
run, was 0.09& for the ﬁrst C run, 0.17& for the second C run and
0.14& for both N runs. The precision of the plant bulk samples,
based on the reproducibility of BROC-2 measured six times within
each run, was 0.02 for was the C run and 0.09 for the N run. Only
those collagen samples that had a C:N ratio within the accepted
range of 2.9e3.6 were included in the analysis (DeNiro, 1985). All
collagen samples were measured in triplicate except for sample
KFO57, where enough material was available for only one
measurement.
4.5. Charring correction
Experimental studies (Fraser et al., 2013a) have shown that
charring increases plant d15N values by 1& (the species that were
studied include T. aestivum, T. monococcum, T. dicoccum, Triticum
spelta, Hordeum vulgare var. distichum and nudum, L. culinaris, P.
sativum, Vicia faba). Even though Kanstrup et al. (2012) did not ﬁnd
any such charring offsets, their samples were only exposed to the
experimental temperatures for 2 h, which is too short to replicate
the type of charring that causes the “optimal” morphological
preservation like the one observed in the Kouphovouno samples (cf
Charles et al. in prep). Following the ﬁndings of Fraser et al. (2013a),
the plant d15N measurements obtained in this study were corrected
for the charring effect by subtracting 1& from all normalized
measurements.
4.6. ZooMS
Sheep and goat samples were distinguished on the basis of
ZooMS (Zooarchaeology Mass Spectrometry). This method works
on the basis of identifying species-speciﬁc markers in the amino
acid sequences of collagen. The characteristic single peptide
collagen markers have previously been identiﬁed for sheep and
goat in a set of modern and archaeological specimen (Buckley et al.,
2009, 2010). The same collagen that was used to measure the stable
isotopes in the present study was sequenced for ZooMS and all
samples ran in triplicate. 62 out of 63 spots gave successful spectra.

tailed equal variance student’s t-test between KFO cereals and
modern charred cereals, p ¼ 0.68; two-tailed equal variance student’s t-test between KFO pulses and modern charred pulses,
p ¼ 0.75). Additionally, the %C and %N measurements of the Kouphovouno samples show the same trends as the experimentally
charred material:
1) pulses have higher %N than cereals,
2) cereals and pulses have indistinguishable %C values and
3) there is some species clustering in %N among the cereals (see
Fig. 3).
It is on the basis of the similarity of the C:N ratios and the trends
apparent in the %C and %N values that we consider the isotope
measurements reliable.

doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2013.10.023.
5.2. Crop d15N and soil growing conditions
Fig. 4 and Table 1 show that there is no overlap between the d15N
values of the free-threshing wheat and hulled barley from Kouphovouno (mean d15N of free-threshing wheat (n ¼ 13) ¼
5.8  0.7&; mean d15N of hulled barley (n ¼ 7) ¼ 2.7  1.2&). The
only possible explanation for such a striking difference is that the
crops were cultivated in different soils with distinct soil N properties. We will ﬁrst consider the environmental and then the
anthropogenic reasons for explaining the differences between the
soils in the barley and the wheat ﬁelds.
None of the environmental factors discussed earlier are likely to
have affected the ﬁelds around Kouphovouno:
1) geophysical and hydrological reconstruction of the environment
around Kouphovouno (Fouache et al., 2007) indicates that the
soils in the nearby ﬂoodplains and alluvial fans were well
drained and so it is unlikely that they were affected by soil
salinity or denitriﬁcation
2) the site is not located on the coast, so nitrates could not have
been introduced to the land through sea-spray

There are no set rules for accepting or rejecting plant isotope
measurements based on their C:N ratios, like there are with
collagen. In order to assess the reliability of the crop isotope measurements obtained in this study, we compared their C:N ratios to
values of experimentally charred cereals and pulses (using data
from Fraser et al., 2013a; %C values come from Inline Supplementary Table S1, %N values come from Inline Supplementary Table S2;
see our Inline Supplementary Table S2 for calculations of C:N
ranges). The C:N ratios of the Kouphovouno cereals lie between
13.6 and 40.3; those of modern experimentally charred cereals are
between 17.9 and 33.4. The C:N ratios of the Kouphovouno pulses
range between 6.7 and 13.4; those of modern experimentally
charred pulses are between 8.8 and 13.1. Statistically, there are no
signiﬁcant differences between the two groups of values (two-

3) an ecosystemic aridity effect would have affected the entire
region and thus could not have elevated the d15N values of one
ﬁeld and not the other; furthermore, the measured D13C values
indicate that both cereals had enough water available to them
(discussed below in Section 5.4), and so it is unlikely that they
suffered from different degrees of water stress
Out of the handful of anthropogenic factors that can cause 15N
soil enrichment mentioned earlier, only one of them is likely to
have affected the cultivated soils around Kouphovouno. Burning of
fossil fuels is not an issue for the Neolithic period and clear-cutting
of forests only produces a short-term enrichment. The most likely
explanation is that the 15N enrichment in free-threshing wheat
ﬁelds was caused by the application of farmyard manure, a phenomenon that has been found to raise the d15N of cultivated crops
in several different experimental farm settings by up to 10&
(Bogaard et al., 2007; Fraser et al., 2011; Kanstrup et al., 2011, in
press). The reason for the enrichment is that as animal dung releases gaseous ammonia through volatilization, the lighter 14N is
preferentially lost to the atmosphere, leaving behind the heavier
15
N, which is eventually taken up by the plants in the form of
nitrates.
The application of kitchen waste material on cultivated ﬁelds
can be considered as an extension of manuring, as decomposing
material also provides 15N enrichment to the soil (Bogaard, 2012).
This practice can be detected with the presence of pottery sherds in
areas of possible cultivated ﬁelds. Results of the land survey at
Kouphovouno revealed a presence of Neolithic pottery on the top of
the mound, and in smaller quantities on the slopes and the land
adjacent to the tell (see Fig. 4 in Cavanagh et al., 2004:83). Some of
these sherds may have originated from kitchen waste. This raises

the possibility that kitchen waste may have provided some opportunity for soil enrichment in the land proximal to the occupation areas; although the effect would not be as high as that
provided by manure (cf Bogaard, 2012).
Based on their experimental ﬁndings, Fraser et al. (2011) deﬁne
three isotope ranges which represent three different levels of
manure treatment:
1) long term high-level of manuring (values of 6& or above)
2) long term cultivation without manuring (values below 2.5&)
3) medium level of manuring resulting from either long-term
cultivation with low manuring, residual effects after a period
of intensive manuring or early years of a new cultivation regime
(values between 2.5 and 6&)
The manuring bands established experimentally may be
used as a proxy for reconstructing farming practices in the
Neolithic, but it is important to note that these bands can only
be used for comparative purposes and not for assigning deﬁnite
labels to any given measured values, as the absolute ratios vary
in different climatic zones (due to a host of factors such as
altitude and mean annual rainfall; van Klinken et al., 1994). In
the absence of measurements of wild crop species, interpretations of the domestic crops measured in this study are
conﬁned to inter-species differences and can inform us about the
differences in cultivation regimes rather than absolute environmental conditions.
Both cereal crops measured in this study fall into the medium
manuring category, but the varying degree of 15N enrichment
suggests that free-threshing wheat was manured more intensively
than barley. This may reﬂect the farmers’ awareness that barley can

grow in more marginal conditions (Ceccarelli, 1994; Ceccarelli et al.,
2007; Guo et al., 2009), which may have been the basis for
assigning differential value to the crops.
The experimentally manured crops used to establish the
manuring bands are based on treatments of 20e35 tons of manure
per hectare. Rowley-Conwy (1981) estimates that a pair of oxen can
produce about 12 tons of manure per year. Combined with manure
produced by other domestic animals kept on an intensive scale e
goats, sheep, and pigs e it is conceivable that enough manure was
available during the Neolithic to achieve similar levels of soil
enrichment. Most of the manure would have needed to be applied
manually on the ﬁelds, as letting the animals graze on the ﬁelds
during an off-season wouldn’t provide the degree of enrichment
implied by the isotope data. This suggests that the manuring
strategy involved a very conscious and planned manipulation of the

soil and was not simply a by-product of herding animals in the
arable landscape. The intensive soil treatment attests to the longterm use of the ﬁelds, as it takes a number of years for the
enriched N from manure to become available for uptake by crops.
For this reason, it is unlikely that the crops were grown in a regime
of shifting cultivation; rather, the same ﬁelds were used over a
time-span of several generations on a schedule of rotation with
pulses (to allow the soil to regenerate). As manuring leaves a longterm residual effect on the soil, these pulses would also be affected
by the intensive soil treatment and evidence of this would provide
more support for this hypothesis (see Section 5.3).
It is also possible that draught animals were used for spreading
the manure on the ﬁelds and evidence of pathologies indicating the
use of cattle for traction in the Middle Neolithic at Kouphovouno
may support this view (Cantuel, 2010; unpublished).

Fig. 5. d15N and d13C of bulk samples of Middle Neolithic (MN) and Late Neolithic (LN)
crops from Kouphovouno.

Two of the three Late Neolithic barley values are notably lower in

d15N than the rest of the barley values (see Fig. 5). Even though the
sample size is extremely limited, this may suggest that there was a
shift towards reduced manuring of barley in the Late Neolithic.
Another way of inferring 15N enrichment in cultivated crops is
by comparing the measured crop values to a local ‘unmanured
baseline’ e a projection of the value of the forage consumed by
local herbivores (cf Bogaard et al., 2013). The advantage of estimating this baseline is that it represents a diet composed of a
mixture of wild plants, rather than individual measurements of
possible wild plants, which would be the case if wild plants were
measured. In Kouphovouno, the mean domestic herbivore value
(an average of the sheep, goats, cattle, and wild goat d15N) is 4.9&.
Subtracting the approximate value of trophic enrichment of
5  1& (see above) from the value of the local domestic herbivores
gives a value of local forage of 0.1  1&. This ﬁgure is lower than
the value of most of the measured crops, so this line of evidence
corroborates the argument that both cereals grew in soils more
enriched in 15N than the land on which the animals browsed/
grazed. An exception are two barley samples from the Late
Neolithic, which indicate reduced manuring of this crop in the
later phase (see above).

Wheat and barley D13C values (16.5  0.5& and 18.4  0.4&
respectively) indicate that the water status of these two crops did
not differ to a large extent. Based on controlled experiments on the
effects of different watering regimes on the D13C of modern cereals
and pulses, Wallace et al. (2013) deﬁne three ‘watering bands’ that
indicate the broad approximations of the water status of ‘poorly
watered’, ‘moderately watered’ and ‘well watered’ crops. Wheat
grain in the ‘moderately watered band’ exhibits values between 16
and 17&; those grains that have values higher than 17& fall into
the ‘well-watered band’ and those that are lower than 16& are
grouped into the ‘poorly watered band’. The bands for barley have
been deﬁned by adding a mean offset of 1.5& to the wheat bands,
owing to a known physiological offset between the two crops
(Araus et al., 1997, 1999; Jiang et al., 2006; Wallace et al., 2013).
Both cereal crops measured in this study fall into the ‘moderately watered band’ (see Fig. 6) and prompt us to suggest that both
crops had sufﬁcient amounts of water available to them. The fact
that barley is situated slightly higher within its watering band than
wheat should not be considered signiﬁcant, because the boundaries
of the barley band have uncertainty attached to them, owing to the
fact that the physiological offset between wheat and barley (used to
deﬁne the barley bands) has been variably reported as lying between 1 and 2& (Araus et al., 1997, 1999; Jiang et al., 2006). In
addition, Wallace et al. (2013) argue that crops grown under the
same regime may have D13C variable by 0.5e1&. What is clear
from the present data is that both cereals received sufﬁcient
amounts of water during their growth.
5.5. Pulse D13C and water status
The pulses, represented by peas and a single sample of lentil,
exhibit a clearly distinct water status compared to the cereals. The
watering bands for pulses deﬁned through Wallace et al.’s (2013)
controlled experiments have similar values to those of wheat
grain: ‘moderately watered pulses’ lie between 16 and 17&, ‘highly
watered pulses’ are situated above 17& and ‘poorly watered pulses’
fall below 16.

5.3. Pulse d15N and soil growing conditions
Pulses are N2-ﬁxers that obtain most of their nitrogen from the
atmosphere, and for this reason, they are less affected by soil 15N
enrichment factors than crops such as cereals. The peas cultivated
in Neolithic Kouphovouno (mean d15N ¼ 1.3  0.3&) exhibit
noticeable enrichment over their primary source of nitrogen: AIR,
which is 0& (see Fig. 4). Low-intensity manuring of pulses is
almost invisible in the isotope record as it causes increases in d15N
which are almost indistinguishable from measurement error
(Fraser et al., 2011). As a result, when there is a noticeable
enrichment (an example is intensively manured farm-grown pulses in the island of Evvia (Fraser et al., 2011:2800, Fig. 5)), we are
led to argue that the crops were grown under a high-intensity
manuring regime.

2005; see text). Measured values are plotted with watering bands established by
Wallace et al. (2013).

The mean D13C of the peas (18.9  0.9&) and the value of the
lentil (19.1&) (Fig. 6) lie c. 2& above the well-watered pulse band.
Experimental studies have shown that there are no obvious trends
with seasonality and D13C, only that pulses seem to be more sensitive to water input than cereals (pulses grown in dry soils look
‘very dry’ and pulses grown in wet soils look ‘very wet’) (Wallace
et al., 2013). The effect this sensitivity would have on the pulse
D13C, however, would not be as great as to account for the high D13C
values measured in this study. For this reason, we argue that the
pulses were watered artiﬁcially.
The higher standard deviation of the peas (0.9& compared 0.5&
and 0.4& of the cereals) may indicate that the pulses were being
watered by hand, a practice that has been suggested as a possible
cause of high D13C variability in archaeobotanical remains from
Assiros Toumba (Wallace, 2011; unpublished). There is no archaeological evidence for the use of irrigation at Kouphovouno. In
modern collections, such higher D13C variability was observed at a
small-scale ‘traditional farm’ situation on the Greek island of Evvia,
where the application of water was not standardized among
different farmers (Wallace et al., 2013).
Thus, both the carbon and nitrogen lines of evidence suggest
that pulse crops were being cultivated on an intensive, likely ‘garden type’ scale. Note that even though there is a slight suggestion
that in the Late Neolithic, the d13C of peas increased (see Fig. 5) (and
therefore D13C decreased), all the peas still fall well above the
moderately watered band.

210

look at more subtle differences in the diets of the Neolithic livestock
(see Fig. 4 and Table 2). Sheep, goats and cattle all cluster in the
same region, which is a result of their herbivorous nature. More
subtle differences in the feeding strategies of the sheep and goat in
the Middle and Late Neolithic periods are discussed below in Section 5.8. The values of the pigs and the dogs are more elevated on
the d15N scale, which is in line with their more omnivorous dietary
habits. The d13C of the dogs is less negative than that of the pigs,
which may be the result of higher consumption of meat products
(different authors report offsets of þ1e2.6& for the ‘carnivore effect’: Bocherens et al., 1995; Lee-Thorp et al., 1989; Sillen et al.,
1989). The same is the case for the one value of bear. Part of the
reason for the high d15N of the pigs may be that they consumed
kitchen waste, which may have contained the grains or by-products
of manured crops (discussed below in section 5.7). The one value of
cattle with extremely elevated d15N is considered to be an outlier.
5.7. Projected chaff d13C & d15N and pig foddering
Measurement of plant isotope values enables us to not only infer
ancient crop growing conditions, but also to evaluate their potential
contributions to the human and animal diets. Having measured
three different crop types cultivated at Kouphovouno, we are now
better equipped to try to interpret which of the crops may have
been consumed by the domestic animals.
Experimental studies have shown that there is a c. 2.4& offset
in d15N and 1.9& in wheat d13C and 1.7% in barley d13C between
cereal grain and rachis (the stem within the cereal ear) (Fraser et al.,
2011; Wallace et al., 2013). Fig. 7 shows the projected values of the
free-threshing wheat and barley chaff for the Kouphovouno crops
(wheat chaff: d15N z 3.5&, d13C z 23.8&; barley chaff:
d15N z 0.3&, d13C z 25.6&). Among all the animals studied, pigs

are the ones that would have obtained most of their food from in or
around the village (Rivals et al., 2011). Subtracting the diet-tissue
spacing value of 5  1& (see above) from the measured d15N of
the pigs (mean 5.9  0.9&), we get a value of c. 0.9  1& for the
composition of the pig diets. This is consistent with a diet made up
of a mixture of barley grain and/or by-product, a small contribution
from the by-product of wheat, any component of the pulses, or
other vegetation with comparable isotopic composition. What the
pigs could not have been consuming to a signiﬁcant extent is the
free-threshing wheat grain. This result suggests that wheat was
grown exclusively for human consumption and thus had a different
cultural value to barley in this Neolithic context.
5.8. Sheep & goat diets and diachronic change
Sheep and goats are often grouped into one domestic animal
category due to the morphological similarity of their skeletons, but
the two species exhibit distinct grazing/browsing adaptations and
are thus expected to have different diets. In this study, the differentiation of sheep and goat bones using ZooMS analysis allowed us
to investigate the very nature of those differences.
The two major factors to consider while differentiating between
sheep and goat diets on an isotopic level are: 1) the type of habitat
in which the animals graze/browse, and 2) the choice of plants or
plant parts that they consume; and these two factors may be
inﬂuenced by the sizes of the animal herds. Sheep prefer to graze
on grassy vegetation in open habitats while goats favor more leafy
and woody vegetation in closed environments. If kept in large
numbers, the animals are likely herded separately and taken to
their optimal habitats (Halstead pers. comm.; Shipley, 1999). Their
diets thus reﬂect both habitat and plant choices. If kept in smaller
numbers, the sheep and goat are likely herded together in the same

pasture areas or on parts of the arable landscape (Halstead, 2006;
Halstead pers. comm.). Differences in their isotope values are thus
mostly inﬂuenced by the plant part choices made by each species.
Fig. 8a shows that sheep and goat at Neolithic Kouphovouno
exhibit isotopically diverging diets, and further that these differences changed between the Middle and the Late Neolithic. In the
Middle Neolithic, the diets of these animals differed on the d13C
scale (this difference is statistically signiﬁcant at the 99% conﬁdence level; two-tailed equal variance student’s t-test, p ¼ 0.0041),
while in the Late Neolithic, they differed on the d15N scale (the
differences are statistically signiﬁcant at 95% conﬁdence; twotailed equal variance student’s t-test, p ¼ 0.043). Mean d13C of
MN sheep (n ¼ 5) ¼ 20.8  0.2&; mean d13C of MN goats
(n ¼ 3) ¼ 20.1  0.1&. Mean d13C of LN sheep (n ¼ 7) ¼
20.3  0.4&; mean d13C of LN goats (n ¼ 4) ¼ 20.1  0.3&).
Mean d15N of LN sheep ¼ 5.3  0.7&; mean d15N of LN
goats ¼ 4.2  0.9&; mean d15N of MN sheep ¼ 4.8  0.4&; mean
d15N of MN goats ¼ 5.0  1.0&.
Middle Neolithic sheep and goats at Kouphovouno have similar
d15N, but the sheep have lower d13C than the goats. Woody vegetation tends to have lower d13C values due to its higher content of
lignin (see Svendsen (2001) on lignin composition of browse and
Benner et al. (1987) on the carbon isotopic composition of lignin),
although several factors are likely to determine the differences between grass and leaf d13C in the same environment (see Escudero
et al. (2008) for a study on how leaf longevity is related to water
availability, photosynthetic rates and d13C in woody plants). If the
assumption that d13C of woody vegetation in the Sparta basin was
lower than that of grass is correct and the difference in d13C of the
sheep and goats was due to the choice of plants, goats would be
expected to have lower d13C values. As this is not the case, the isotopic distinctions are likely a result of feeding in different habitats.
There are two types of habitats which could produce more 13C
depleted grasses for the sheep to consume. The ﬁrst are forested
environments affected by the canopy effect. This phenomenon has
been argued to cause depletion in 13C in the understories of forest

canopies (as opposed to leaves/parts of trees situated higher up
or vegetation growing in more open environments) due to a combination of two factors: i) the re-assimilation of recycled and 13Cdepleted CO2 from respiration and/or decomposition of forest litter,
and ii) fractionation caused by reduced light intensity in the lower
parts of forests during photosynthesis (Bonaﬁni et al., 2013; Drucker
et al., 2008; Heaton, 1999; van der Merwe and Medina, 1991).
The second type of habitat where the Middle Neolithic sheep
could have obtained their 13C depleted grasses are areas with
wetter soils (cf Farquhar et al., 1982, 1989; Wallace et al., 2013). As
sheep prefer to subsist in more open environments rather than
forested canopies, this latter explanation is more likely. The
distinction in diets between the MN ovicaprids may be the result of
large enough herd sizes, which justiﬁed the management of sheep
and goat in different habitats. The one sample of goat measured,
which comes from the Middle Neolithic, has a less negative d13C
than all the MN sheep and goat (see Fig. 8a). This suggests that it
was not exploiting either of the habitats that the sheep and goat
were subsisting in. The limited sample sizes (3 MN goats, 4 LN
goats, 5 MN sheep and 7 LN sheep) remind us that we must exercise
caution with interpreting these results, but the discussion presented herein is only concerned with statistically signiﬁcant differences. Still, the main aim of this part of the discussion is to
demonstrate the avenues of research that can be pursued with this
type of stable isotope data, rather than to provide conclusive answers to the archaeological questions.
In the Late Neolithic, the isotopes of the sheep and goats are
variable on the d15N scale, while the d13C are indistinguishable (but
both d13C and d15N values are more variable on an intra-species
level). In light of the feeding strategies discussed above, it is
possible that in the later part of the Neolithic, the sizes of the sheep
and goat herds decreased and both animals were now being
managed together and the slight differences in their d15N were
caused by the choice of plants and plant parts. The farmers may
have made greater use of the arable land for grazing during a fallow
season, and this would be consistent with Halstead’s (2000) model

212

P. Vaiglova et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 42 (2014) 201e215

of intensive mixed farming, where small ﬂocks are managed within
the interstices of the cultivated land.
Beyond informing us about the possible distinctions in the
feeding strategies of the Neolithic sheep and goat, the results presented herein indicate that there was a shift in the management
strategy of the ovicaprids between the two Neolithic phases. This
shift may have manifested itself with a decrease in the size of the
sheep herds, leading to a reduced predominance of sheep in the
livestock population. A similar shift has been observed more
broadly by Halstead (2000) between the Early and the Late Greek
Neolithic: in the Early Neolithic, faunal assemblages were dominated by sheep, while Late Neolithic assemblages show a more
balanced representation of all the domestic animals.
The changes in animal management at Kouphovouno happened
in the context of shifts in ceramic styles and expression of sociocultural identity. In the Middle Neolithic, the pottery style was
more uniform and greater emphasis was placed on expression of
group identity, while in the Late Neolithic, a more diversiﬁed pottery style signaled a movement towards greater individuality (Mee
et al. in prep.). At the same time, different livestock management
strategies may have been fueled by a changed attitude towards land
ownership.
5.9. Cattle & dog diets and environmental change?
The results discussed so far indicate that there was a diachronic
change in the feeding strategies of the sheep and goats. Conversely,
Fig. 8b shows that the diets of pigs did not change through time
(the differences are not statistically signiﬁcant: two-tailed equal
variance student’s t-test for the d13C values, p ¼ 0.11; two tailed
equal variance student’s t-test for the d15N values, p ¼ 0.95). A
closer look at the other major domestic animals, cattle and dogs,
add to the story about change in animal management strategies in
the Late Neolithic.
All the Late Neolithic dogs have more negative d13C values
than all the Middle Neolithic dogs (d13C of MN dogs (n ¼ 3) ¼
18.6  0.5&; d13C of LN dogs (n ¼ 4) ¼ 19.6  0.1&) (see Fig. 8c;
two-tailed equal variance student’s t-test shows signiﬁcance at the
99% conﬁdence level, p ¼ 0.0088). Their d15N values are indistinguishable (two-tailed student’s equal variance t-test, p ¼ 0.58). As
the bulk of dog diet is not composed of just grasses and leaves but
of a more diverse range of food sources which have undergone
further fractionation after being consumed by primary herbivores,
their d13C do not reﬂect the water status of the areas from which
their foods were derived. Thus, the lower d13C values cannot be a
result of subsisting on food items grown in wetter soils (as is the
case with Middle Neolithic sheep).
The diachronic difference in d13C could be the result of reduced
consumption of meat products in the Late Neolithic in conjunction
with an increased consumption of cultivated crops. Meat products
have a positive effect on both d13C and d15N (for the carnivore effect in
d13C see Bocherens et al., 1995; Lee-Thorp et al., 1989; Sillen et al.,
1989; for trophic level enrichment in d15N see DeNiro and Epstein,
1981; Hedges and Reynard, 2007; Minagawa and Wada, 1984).
Consumption of less meat in the Late Neolithic would decrease the
dogs’ d13C and d15N values, but an increased consumption of
manured crop products would compensate for the decrease in d15N
so in the end, only the effect on carbon would be detectable. The crop
products could have been obtained by scavenging on human food
waste. Note that this suggestion does not exclude the possibility of
meat consumption in the LN altogether. It is still likely that dogs
consumed more meat than pigs due to their less negative d13C values,
but what this discussion centers on (once again taking the limited
sample size into account) is the likelihood that in the Late Neolithic,
the dogs consumed it to a smaller extent than in the Middle Neolithic.

The browsing and grazing adaptations of herbivores exist on a
continuum, in a way that the animals pick and chose the most
nutritious food that is available, whether it be grass or browse (Lisa
Shipley, pers. comm.). For this reason, there is a lot of overlap between the dietary choices of sheep, goat and cattle. There is a statistically signiﬁcant difference at the 95% conﬁdence between the
d15N values of the Middle Neolithic cattle (n ¼ 4) and Late Neolithic
cattle (n ¼ 11) (two-tailed equal variance student’s t-test, p ¼ 0.010).
Despite the limited sample size, we will attempt to explain what
such a difference may mean. As with the ovicaprids, the feeding
strategy of the cattle changed in the Late Neolithic (see Fig. 8d). The
Middle Neolithic cattle are situated in the same d13C region as the
Middle Neolithic sheep (two-tailed equal variance student’s t-test,
p ¼ 0.40) and this may be because they shared the same wetter
pasture grasses, perhaps along the banks of the Eurotas river. In the
Late Neolithic, the cattle seems to divide into two clusters; one that
overlaps with the Middle Neolithic sheep and one that does not (see
Fig. 8d). This may mean that while the same pasture grasses were
still consumed by cattle in the Late Neolithic, some cattle may have
been kept in other, drier, areas as well. The cattle that may have
grazed along the banks of the Eurotas also exhibit quite a wide range
of d15N values, which includes the lowest d15N value of all the domestic animals at Kouphovouno. This may be related to consumption of a wide range of different grasses in this habitat.
Most of the domestic animals apart from pigs seem to have
experienced a shift in feeding strategies between the Middle and
the Late Neolithic. On the isotopic scale, these shifts did not move in
the same direction. The dogs’ d13C decreased, the sheep d13C
increased, the goats’ and cattle d15N decreased while the sheep d15N
increased. This suggests that the changes were not the result of
some environmental change (one that would cause an increase in
d15N in all Late Neolithic vegetation, for example), but that they
were related to shifts in management of the farm animals.
6. Synthesis and conclusion
This study is one of the ﬁrst to integrate plant and animal dietary
isotopes (see also Fraser et al. (2013b) and Lightfoot and Stevens
(2012)) and the ﬁrst to combine this methodology with collagen
sequencing of sheep and goats. The data provide support for the
model of small-scale mixed agriculture and settlement organization
put forth by previous archaeobotanical and archaeozoological investigations (Bogaard, 2004a, 2004b, 2005; Bogaard and Isaakidou,
2010; Halstead, 1996, 2000, 2006; Kotsakis, 1999). Beyond providing
support to this theory, however, the stable isotopic method offers
new insight for understanding the integration of the crop cultivation and animal husbandry and how these regimes functioned
within the given settlement organization over the long-term. Some
of the interpretations in this study are limited by small sample sizes,
and their primary value is in demonstrating what sorts of questions
this methodology can address rather than for providing deﬁnite
answers for the prehistoric farming techniques.
Even though the tell at Kouphovouno was not excavated in its
entirety and we therefore do not know how dense the settlement
was, the available archaeology indicates that the village was
nucleated or organized into neighborhoods. Such settlement
conﬁguration would have provided opportunity for intensive
agriculture either on the periphery of the settlement and/or in
plots adjacent to the neighborhoods. The more proximal ﬁelds
would have been more valuable as they provided the opportunity
for high labor-investment under a small-scale intensive treatment
(cf Jones et al., 1999). This is where the crops grown for human
consumption e free-threshing wheat and pulses e were likely
grown in rotation with one another, receiving manure in the form
of dung from the domestic animals.

P. Vaiglova et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 42 (2014) 201e215

In the Late Neolithic, the application of manure may have been
less labor-intensive. The few LN barley samples indicates that this
crop likely received less manure than it did during the Middle
Neolithic and the wheat/pulse ﬁelds may have been manured
directly by sheep and goat grazing on the arable plots. Furthermore
in this Neolithic phase, the scale of sheep/goat management seems
to have decreased, dogs fed on smaller amounts of meat products
and larger amounts of cultivated crops and cattle were likely taken
to two different areas for grazing. These diachronic shifts in crop
and animal management highlight the fact that even though smallscale mixed farming embraced the “Neolithic package” in a seemingly consistent fashion across the continent, it did allow for ﬂexibility in the scale of crop and animal husbandry and the amount of
labor-investment.
