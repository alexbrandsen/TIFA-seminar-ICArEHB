Mud constructed cooking installations such as ovens and hearths are common in modern, pre-modern
and archaeological domestic contexts in West and Central Asia. Archaeological cooking installations
are primarily identiﬁed using analogy of shape and size to ethnographic installations. The study presented here establishes direct evidence to the use of ﬁre within mud constructed cooking installations,
thus providing means for reducing ambiguity in identiﬁcation of archaeological cooking installations. In
addition, we present here a newly developed method that enables a clear-cut distinction between wood
and dung ashes used as fuel materials in many modern and archaeological domestic contexts. The study
is based on an ethnoarchaeological research in rural households at the Republic of Uzbekistan that was
followed by geoarchaeological analyses of installation walls, wood ash, dung ash and wood and dung
standards collected in the study area. Field work included ethnographic observations, interviews with
informants and temperature measurements during cooking experiments. We show that changes in the
clay mineral structure due to exposure to high temperatures on the interior walls of cooking installations
can be detected using FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy, providing for the ﬁrst time direct
evidence to the use of ﬁre within such installations. We demonstrate that the temperature recorded by
clay alteration on installation walls as well as in the ashes left on installation bottoms does not correspond to baking or cooking temperatures. We also show that the newly developed method, based on the
ratio of wood ash pseudomorphs to dung spherulites, separates between wood and dung ashes with very
high certainty. Yet, we identify a range of values where differentiation between wood and dung ashes is
uncertain, and suggest it results from intensive mixing processes. Lastly, we show that phytolith morphotype analysis is an insufﬁcient tool, if used alone, for distinguishing wood from dung ashes in the
study area. The newly developed tools for temperature estimation within mud constructed installations
and for fuel origin determination contribute to better understanding of cooking-related practices, and
can be applied to archaeological contexts worldwide.

1. Introduction
The manipulation of raw animal and vegetal materials into edible
and nutritious food is a hallmark of human evolution (Carmody and
Wrangham, 2009; Organ et al., 2011; Wollstonecroft, 2011;
Wrangham, 2009). Cooking probably developed with the earliest
systematic use of ﬁre by hominins, inferred from the identiﬁcation of
hearths associated with burnt animal bones as early as the Lower

Palaeolithic ca. 400,000 years ago (Roebroeks and Villa, 2011).
Hearths can therefore be regarded as the earliest cooking installations. Mud constructed cooking installations are a much later
development in human history, possibly dating as early as the PPNB
culture in the southern Levant and Southeastern Anatolia, some
7000 years ago (Lyons and D’Andrea, 2003). The research presented
here focuses on mud constructed cooking installations, speciﬁcally
those related to west and central Asian types.
Mud constructed cooking installations in west and central Asia
have been described from pre-modern times by explorers, ethnographers and ethnoarchaeologists (e.g., Avitsur, 1971; Dalman,
1964; Frankel, 2011; Kramer, 1982; McQuitty, 1984, 1993; Mulder-

Heymans, 2002; Parker, 2011; Parker and Üzel, 2007; Weinstein,
1973). These installations can be broadly separated into baking installations (dome-shaped ovens known as Tanur/Tandir, Tabun, and
two-storied ovens known as Wagdiah/Arsah/Mogadeh) and fryingroasting-boiling installations (hearths of various types). The Tanur is
a large (between 80 and 150 cm high and 50e80 cm in diameter)
cylindrical shaped installation built from soil with a ventilation hole
at its base, and a large opening at the top. It is either dug into the
surface of activity (Kramer, 1982), incorporated into a mud built
superstructure (Crawford, 1981) or is free standing with at least one
coating layer for insulation (McQuitty, 1984). It is usually fueled with
wood, dung, and/or crop processing waste located at its base while
the dough for bread is placed on its inner walls.
The Tabun is a hemispherical installation shorter than the Tanur
(30 cm high and about 80 cm in diameter) with a wide opening at
the top from which the dough is inserted (McQuitty, 1984). Tabun
shapes and sizes vary regionally (Frankel, 2011; McQuitty, 1993). In
northern Jordan, for example, the Tabun has a side opening from
which wood fuel and olive pulp after pressing (jift) are inserted,
and a built base where the dough is laid to bake. In southern Jordan
and in Israel Tabuns are laid on top of a shallowly excavated area
covered by river pebbles or potsherds. These installations have no
side opening, and the fuel (mostly crushed dung and crop processing waste) is piled around the installation from the outside.
Fuel is kept warm constantly all year long whereas refueling (and
thus more intensive burning) occurs prior to every daily use.
Ethnographic research on similar and other types of cooking
installations was also carried out in other parts of the world where
cooking installations were (and are) still in use. For example,
Greenhouse et al. (1981) studied the botanical residues from the
use of earth ovens lined with pebbles by a group of Pima Indians in
the Gila River reservation. Thoms (2008) studied cook-stone features used by North American Indians, and Amouretti (1986)
documented the use of a pit oven in the Sahara. Spatial distribution patterns related to the use of hearths were studied in forager
societies in different parts of the world (Binford, 1998; Fisher and
Strickland, 1989, 1991), while studies on the botanical remains
resulting from fueling hearths with dung were conducted by Miller
in Iran (Miller, 1984b) and Reddy in India (1998).
Archaeologically, hearths are prevalent in sites in west Asia since
the Middle Palaeolithic while installations that somewhat resemble
Tanurs and/or Tabuns in shape and size are prevalent since the
Early Bronze Age (4the3rd millenniums BC). A special hearth type,
consisting of a pavement of river pebbles, is known for example
from Iron Age (ca. 3200 years BP) Israel and is ethnically associated
with the Philistine culture (Gur-Arieh et al., 2012 and references
therein). Field identiﬁcation of these archaeological installations is
based on simple analogy of shape and size between ethnographic
and archaeological installations, sometimes coupled with attention
to presence of burnt fuel (ash) within or on archaeological installations, and somewhat also assisted by the general archaeological context (e.g., domestic context). While most of these
identiﬁcations may be correct, we ﬁnd that they are based on
insufﬁcient and inconclusive data. The following questions are
crucial for better ﬁeld identiﬁcation of cooking installations:

were used during operation of archaeological installations. While
ethnographic studies generally showed that wood and dung are the
most widely-used fuels (Kramer, 1982; McQuitty, 1993; Miller,
1982, 1984a, 1984b; Miller and Marston, 2012; Parker and Üzel,
2007; Pierce et al., 1998; Samuel, 1989; Zapata Peña et al., 2004),
no study to date touched upon the proportions of such fuels within
speciﬁc installations. We therefore carried out an ethnoarchaeological research that was geared toward identifying physical and chemical criteria by which it could be determined whether
a mud installation has been used for cooking, and toward understanding what types of fuel can be identiﬁed from ashes found
within cooking installations. The ethnoarchaeological research
treated the modern installations and ashes as if they were
archaeological, i.e., we carried out sampling in a manner similar to
sampling archaeological installations and sediments in an archaeological context, for later geoarchaeological analyses.
1.1. Research area
The ethnoarchaeological study was conducted in Uzbekistan in
collaboration with the Samarkand Institute of Archaeology, Uzbek
Academy of Sciences.
The Republic of Uzbekistan is located in central Asia within the
Aral Sea basin. About 80% of its area is arid or semi-arid while the
climate in the lowlands and mid-altitude is Mediterranean with
wet winters and dry summers (Gintzburger et al., 2003). More than
60% of the population lives in rural areas, of which about 34%
subsist on agro-pastoralism (Payziyeva and Paiziev, 2012). The
research reported here was conducted ca. 25 km south of Samarkand, in the Karatyube Mountains area. The area is semi-arid with
about 300 mm annual precipitation that carries mid-latitude
steppe vegetation (Fig. 1).
The research was carried out in two villages, Sivasoy at the eastern
part of the mountain ridge and Tolly at the western part of the same
ridge, among two subsistence agro-pastoral families. Like other
families in the research area, these families live in households that
include a house for a nuclear family and separate houses for married
sons and their families. Households include a courtyard where
various economic and social activities are carried out daily, a garden
(that carries perennial vegetables as well as fruit trees) and animal
enclosures (Kandiyoti,1999 and personal observations). In these rural
areas, houses are built from mud and vegetal materials, electricity
supply is scarce if existing, and although gas stoves are sometimes
used, the main means of cooking, baking and heating are traditional
installations. These traditional installations, locally called tandir and
ochock, are built from mud and vegetal matter (most commonly
straw). The tandir is a baking oven almost identical to the Turkish
installation bearing the same name. The ochock is a partially enclosed
hearth used for cooking, which includes roasting, frying and stewing.
Cooking with the ochock is a daily task while baking takes place every
two to three days. The general aridity of the environment, coupled
with herd products due to the pastoral component in the economy of
the society, dictates use of wood, dung and/or crop processing waste
as fuel for cooking and baking activities.
2. Materials and methods

1. Is there evidence for heat within these installations?
2. Is the associated ‘ash’ indeed ash?
3. Is the associated ‘ash’ in situ, or a later dumping event into an
unused installation?
We could not ﬁnd ethnographic documentation geared toward
answering these questions. Another research question that did not
receive much attention in archaeological research at historical sites
in west Asia relates to the identiﬁcation of the type/s of fuel that

2.1. Field work
Field work was conducted for a period of two weeks during
October 2011 and included ethnographic observations, interviews,
experimentation with various fuel types, and sampling of sediments, raw fuel materials, ash, and installation wall parts. The study
in the Sivasoy household was made possible owing to the wife of
the household’s owner. Additional information was obtained by

conversations with two of her daughters-in-law. The study in the
Tolly household was made possible with the help of the wife of the
youngest son of the household’s owner (Figs. 1 and 2a, b). Interviews were conducted with the help of an Uzbek interpreter.
Material sampling, temperature measurements and experimentation with various types of fuel were all conducted under full
permission.

2.2. Field experiments
Field experiments, designed to measure the temperature ranges
during cooking and baking in ochocks and tandirs were conducted
in both households. Five experiments were carried out in Sivasoy,
two in the tandir and three in the ochock. The variable tested was
the type of fuel, i.e., wood was used as fuel in one experiment and

dung in the second, using the same installation and cooking/baking
the same type of food. Four experiments were carried out in Tolly,
two in each installation, once with wood and once with dung. The
repetition of fuel type in the same installation was purposefully
done in order to evaluate the reproducibility of results.
In each experiment, the weight of fuel used during the cooking
activity was recorded using a portable scale. Temperature along the
cooking activity was recorded every few minutes using two
portable thermometers (Newtron TM 5005, useful for temperatures
up to 1300  C with precision of 1  C  0.3%). One detector was
placed within the burning fuel at the bottom of each installation.
The second detector was placed between the installation wall and
the cooking pot in order to measure the temperature just below the
pot’s bottom in the case of ochock experiments, while in tandir
experiments the second detector was placed in the back of the
installation, hanging from the ventilation hole or from the main
opening, as close as possible to the tandir’s wall in order to record
baking temperature on tandir walls as best as possible (Fig. 2c, d).
Samples for laboratory analyses were collected following the
experiments, after the installation walls and/or fuel cooled down.
Installation walls were sampled by scraping or chipping small
fragments from the bottom and top of the wall, inside and out. Ash
from the remains of fuel material inside the installations was
sampled as well. Different (unburnt) fuel materials were collected
in both villages, including various plants and dung cakes. In Sivasoy,
a household midden where ashes are regularly discarded was
excavated as if it was an archaeological feature, sectioned and ashy
sediments were sampled vertically along its proﬁle. The location of
each sample was marked with a numbered note and photographed.
The following laboratory analyses were conducted in order to study
the effect of heat on installation walls and sediments, and whether
fueling practices can be deduced from ash.
2.3. FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy
FTIR analyses were conducted in order to determine the
mineralogical composition of sediments and evaluate whether
calcite and clay minerals have been transformed due to heating
(Berna et al., 2007; Regev et al., 2010; Weiner, 2010). Spectra were
obtained using Nicolet 380 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Electron
Corporation), collected between 4000 and 250 cm1 at 4 cm1
resolution using the KBr method. The results were evaluated based
on a reference library (Weiner, 2010) and by conducting a heating
experiment speciﬁc to the soils from the study area (see Section 2.4
below).
2.4. Soil heating experiment
Local soils around Sivasoy and Tolly are composed primarily of
clay (dominated by illite) and calcite. Samples of about 50 mg of soil
were heated for 4 h in a furnace oven (Adam Mandel T21Ó), each to
a different maximal temperature as follows: 200, 300, 400, 500,
600, 700, 800 and 900  C. After cooling, the heated soil was
analyzed using FTIR spectrometry and a reference of the spectral
changes to the local soil with increased heating was built (Fig. 3a).
Two major criteria enable deduction of the temperature to which
the soil has been exposed. The ﬁrst is based on changes in the
infrared spectrum of the clay fraction in the soil which initially
undergoes signiﬁcant change when burnt at 500  C noted by the
disappearance of the peaks at 527, 915 and 3620 cm1. When
exposed to higher temperatures the main clay absorbance band
shifts gradually from 1029 cm1 to 1048 cm1 (Fig. 3a). These
changes occur due to irreversible structural changes in the clay
mineral lattice (Berna et al., 2007). The second criterion is a change
in the infrared spectrum of the calcite present in the soil. When

heated to 800e900  C calcite breaks down into calcium oxide
(CaO), that immediately upon cooling absorbs humidity and forms
calcium hydroxide (Ca[OH]2). This material is identiﬁed using
infrared spectroscopy by the presence of an absorbance band at
3643 cm1 (Weiner, 2010) (Fig. 3a). These changes in the infrared
spectra of clay and calcite in soil thus provide means to determining
the maximal temperature to which these minerals in a cooking
installation wall were exposed to.
2.5. Microscopy
Microscopic remains that are expected to be found, and are
indicative of fueling materials include opal phytoliths, dung
spherulites and wood ash pseudomorphs. All three were studied
using a polarized light microscope (Nikon Labophot2-POL).
2.5.1. Quantiﬁcation of ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites
Both ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites are micro remains composed of calcite, each indicative of speciﬁc fuel material
(Braadbaart et al., 2012; Canti, 2003; Lancelotti and Madella, 2012;
Matthews, 2010). Ash pseudomorphs are created when calcium
oxalate crystals (CaC2O4$H2O) that form in living plants undergo
heating to at least 450  C (see Shahack-Gross and Ayalon, 2013 for a
detailed description of their formation). Their typical shapes are
druses (crystal cluster), rombohedral and prismatic crystals that are
more common in dicotyledonous plants (hereafter dicots), and
raphides or styloids that are more common in monocotyledonous
plants (hereafter monocots) (Franceschi and Nakata, 2005; Prychid
and Rudall, 1999) and their size range is typically 10e50 mm. They
are dark gray in plane polarized light (PPL) and have high order
interference colors in cross polarized light (XPL) (Canti, 2003;
Shahack-Gross and Ayalon, 2013). Dung spherulites are spherical
bodies ranging 5e20 mm composed of radially crystallized monohydrocalcite that forms in the intestines of animals, especially ruminants (Canti, 1997; Shahack-Gross, 2011). Under cross polarized
light they can be identiﬁed by their permanent cross of extinction
and low order white to second order orange interference colors
(Brochier, 1983; Shahack-Gross, 2011).
In order to determine quantitatively whether fuel in cooking
installations was composed of wood, dung or both, quantiﬁcation of
these microscopic remains is necessary. Oxalates in monocot plants
are often rare to absent (Prychid and Rudall, 1999), therefore, styloids and raphides are not expected to be found in high quantities
in dung ash. Rhombohedral and prismatic oxalate crystals are expected in high quantities in wood ash. Druses are known in both
monocot and dicot plants and are expected in both dung and wood
ashes.
While dung spherulites have been quantiﬁed recently from
archaeological sediments (Albert et al., 2008; Berna et al., 2007;
Portillo et al., 2009; Simpson et al., 2003), their quantiﬁcation
was based on counting inhomogeneous samples prepared by
mixing a weighed aliquot of sediment sample with a high viscosity
gluing material (usually Entellan New, Merck), on a microscope
slide. We present here a new procedure that allows for homogenous spread of microscopic remains, based on the phytolith rapid
extraction method of Katz et al. (2010) that takes advantage of the
low viscosity of a heavy liquid solution prepared from sodium
polytungstate.
The procedure is as follows: Between 5 and 40 mg sediment or
ash are weighed using an analytical balance (Sartorius
BP121S  0.1 mg) and sieved through a 150 mm sieve in order to
eliminate grains larger than ash pseudomorphs and/or dung
spherulites (if the sediment contains aggregates they can be gently
crushed with the edge of a spatula). When working with fresh ash,
less than 10 mg should be weighed in order to avoid sample

Fig. 3. (a) FTIR spectra of soil from the Sivasoy area heated to various temperatures in laboratory conditions. The spectral changes that occur at different temperatures allow using
these signatures for determination of heat exposure in cooking installation walls and ashes. Note that the absorption bands characteristic of clay (red labels) and calcite (blue labels)
change with temperature as follows: At 500  C the clay absorptions at 527, 915 and 3620 cm1 disappear and the calcite absorptions remain unchanged. At 600  C the main clay
absorption shifts from 1032 to 1037 cm1, a change that continues to 1046 cm1 gradually with increasing temperature to 900  C. From 600  C to 900  C the calcite absorptions
change as well, noted by lowering of the calcite characteristic absorptions relative to the clay absorptions, and appearance/formation of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) absorbance
band at 3643 cm1 (b) FTIR spectra obtained from: (1) Inner wall of tandir showing clay spectrum indicative to heating at about 600  C (red labels), and presence of the mineral
anhydrite (CaSO4; green labels). (2) Outer wall of tandir showing spectra characteristic of unheated clay (red labels) and unheated calcite (blue labels). (3) Dung ash from a cooking
experiment showing spectra of clay and calcite heated at about 900  C (main clay absorption at 1047 cm1 and presence of calcium hydroxide absorption at 3643 cm1). Note that

referred to the web version of this article.)

overloading, but in the case of archaeological samples between 30
and 40 mg sediments should be weighed due to their mixed nature.
The sieved sediments are then placed in a 0.5 ml conical centrifuge
tube and 500 ml of 2.4 g/ml sodium polytungstate (SPT,
Na6(H2W12O40)$H2O) (Sometu Ltd., Berlin) are added. The tubes are
vortexed for about three seconds until the suspension is homogenous and then sonicated for 10 min (ColeeParmer Ultrasonic
Cleaner) in order to ensure disaggregation. The tubes are then
vortexed again and 50 ml of the solution are immediately pipetted
out, placed on a microscope slide, and covered by a 24  24 mm
cover slip.
Counting is performed using a polarized light microscope at
400 magniﬁcation. Counting is conducted cumulatively in 15
random ﬁelds across the slide, once in PPL where ash pseudomorphs are better identiﬁed, and once in XPL where dung spherulites are better identiﬁed. The results are calculated as follows in
order to standardize the results presented as the amount of each
microscopic remain per 1 g of sediment:

no: of micro remains counted
 area of the slide

A10ð¼no:of micro remains in all solutionð500 mlÞÞ

Equation (1) calculates the number of microscopic remains
under the entire cover slip, i.e., within 50 ml of the sample solution.
The “area counted” is calculated by multiplying the measured area
of one ﬁeld with the number of ﬁelds counted. Equation (2) calculates the number of microscopic remains in 1 g of sediment by
also accounting for the fact that the result of Equation (1) (value A)
represents 10% of the total sample (50 ml out of 500 ml).

To evaluate the reproducibility of the method for ash pseudomorphs, fresh ashes of oak (Quercus calliprinus) and pomegranate
(Punica granatum) wood and bark were prepared experimentally in
the laboratory by burning small branches in the furnace for 4 h at
550  C after washing with distilled water and sonicating for 30 min
to remove external contamination. These two species were chosen
because initial observations and measurements of ash pseudomorphs showed that pseudomorphs from oak are larger (ranging
15e50 mm) than those of pomegranate (ranging 10e25 mm). We
thus tested the procedure’s reproducibility using pseudomorphs of
different sizes. Counting triplicates of 8 sub-samples of oak ash and
13 of pomegranate ash gave an average error of 11% (Table 1).
To replicate possible mixing of ash with other types of sediment
in an archaeological site, two samples from each species were
prepared by mixing fresh ash with powdered mud brick in predetermined weight ratios of 1:2 and 1:4. We therefore expect
that ash pseudomorph concentrations from each mixture will be a
third or a ﬁfth of the pseudomorph concentration in fresh ash. Each
sample was counted in triplicate. The results show that pseudomorph concentrations reduced as expected, and the measurement’s average error is 14% (Table 1). Fresh dung and wood ashes
from the study area were used to determine the reproducibility in
dung spherulite counting. Three sub-samples were counted in
triplicates resulting in an average error of 31% (Table 1). We
conclude that the maximal error in ash pseudomorph and dung
spherulite quantiﬁcation is in the order of 30%.
We note that SPT has a pH of about 4.5 in the working density
(2.4 g/l) (Skipp and Brownﬁeld, 1993). This raised a concern that
some of the calcitic micro-remains might dissolve during the procedure. However since the results are reproducible and previous
work showed that reaction between calcite and SPT starts only after
one hour (Skipp and Brownﬁeld, 1993), it is methodologically safe
to use SPT for this procedure.
The method was applied to study ashes produced during the
ﬁeld experiments, ashes produced in the laboratory from collected
fresh fuel materials, and sediments from the Sivasoy ash midden.
Preparation of ash in the laboratory from fresh Uzbek wood fuel was
preceded by cleaning of about 10 g of twigs from adhering dust
through sonication (30 min), washing with distilled water and

drying in the oven at 50  C overnight. Preparation of ash in the
laboratory from fresh Uzbek dung was preceded by homogenization
(light grinding) of about 6 g of cow dung and of sheep/goat dung
that was used by the informants to fuel the cooking installations. All
these fuel materials were burnt at 500  C for 4 h in a furnace oven.
The ashes were weighed after cooling to room temperature.
2.5.2. Phytolith analysis
Phytoliths are hydrated silica (opal) particles that form in living
plants. Thus they provide, to some extent, taxonomic information
about the plant material brought to a site (Piperno, 2006). Two
parameters in phytolith analysis may be used to differentiate dung
from wood ashes. Phytolith concentrations in wood/bark are much
lower than in grasses (i.e., dung), and phytolith morphologies in
wood/bark and grass are distinctively different (Albert et al., 1999;
Piperno, 2006).
Phytolith analysis was performed according to the rapid
extraction method of Katz et al. (2010). About 20 mg of sediment
were placed in a 0.5 ml conical tube and dissolved by adding 50 ml
HCl 6N. 450 ml of SPT (2.4 g/ml) were added, the sample vortexed
for about three seconds and sonicated for 10 min. The samples were
centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge 5418).
Only opaline particles that could unequivocally be identiﬁed as
phytoliths have been counted. The samples included many multicell phytoliths (silica skeletons). Unlike conventional procedures,
the multi-cellular phytoliths were not counted as 1, but the total
number of individual cells within them was counted. The reason for
this decision stems from taphonomical considerations. Sediments
with low phytolith concentrations sometimes result from poor
phytolith preservation (Cabanes et al., 2011, 2012). Thus counting a
multi-cellular phytolith as one phytolith lowers the concentration
results in a manner that a well preserved sample might erroneously
be considered a poorly preserved one. Phytolith morphologies were
studied and identiﬁed according to the standard literature
(Mulholland and Rapp, 1992; Madella et al., 2005; Piperno, 1988).
Wood/bark and dicot leaves phytoliths were identiﬁed based on the
presence of characteristic morphologies (mainly irregular, parallelepipedal blocky and thin, platelet, spheroid, dicot hair, hair base,
polyhedral, and tracheid phytoliths; Albert et al., 2000).

3. Results
3.1. Ethnographic observations
The houses in the study area are traditionally built of unbaked
mud bricks or “pachsa” (local term for large blocks of casted mud),
on stone foundations (di Cugno et al., 2013 and our own observations). Most work is done by men, but we also observed women
participating in the building process. The households are usually
comprised of a main family house where the owner’s nuclear
family lives, usually in two rooms; one for storage and working and
another that serves for sleep, hosting and other tasks such as
preparation of dough for baking. Additional houses may be added
as the owner’s sons marry and build their own houses. Old
damaged houses serve for storage or for animal keeping. In Sivasoy
the household included the owner’s house and two additional
houses for his sons’ families. In Tolly the owners, an elderly couple,
live in an old structure while the main house is used by their
youngest son’s family. Old structures in this household serve for
storage and animal keeping.
Households are frequently parts of villages. Both Sivasoy and
Tolly are well-spread villages thus neighbors are found only several
hundreds of meters from the main family house. In both Sivasoy
and Tolly water supply was from a nearby stream channel. The
families subsist on herding (mostly sheep and goats, but also cows
depending on the relative wealth of the family) and small scale
horticulture (grapevines, fruit trees, seasonal vegetables). Poplar
trees, used as building materials and fuel, are tended as well.

In all households, a speciﬁc roofed structure is dedicated for
cooking (Fig. 2a, b). Such ‘kitchen’ always includes at least one
tandir and benches for food preparation and placement of utensils.
The tandir is usually built of two layers made of soil. The inner layer
which is made of ﬁne carefully smoothed soil, is often bought from a
local professional builder, and brought unbaked to be placed in the
kitchen. The outer layer, composed of local soil that includes coarse
rock fragments, mixed with chaff and sometimes goats’ hair, is laid
by the resident woman/women. We observed two ways of placing
tandirs within ‘kitchens’ e one by orienting the main opening
vertically so that it is facing the roof and the tandir’s ventilation
hole/s is thus found close to the ground surface. With this type of
installation orientation the women have to bend over the opening
in order to bake (Fig. 4a). The second possibility of tandir orientation is by placing it so that its main opening is facing the room
interior and the ventilation hole/s is at the back, close to the room
wall. The main opening of the installation is ﬁxed at a height that
ﬁts the chest height of an average person thus it does not require
bending in order to insert or take out the bread (Fig. 4b, c).
The ochock is a partially enclosed hearth (key hole or horseshoe
shaped) built from soil mixed with chaff. It may be located either
indoors within a kitchen, or outdoors e either attached to a house
wall or not (Fig. 5). The ochock includes two large openings, one at
its top on which cooking utensils are balanced and one in front
where fuel is added. Cooking on the ochock is mostly done using a
large metallic bowl (Fig. 5).
The kitchen in Sivasoy includes one functioning tandir, one old
tandir that is used for meat roasting in special occasions, and one

ochock. Another ochock, built outside the kitchen but attached to
the kitchen’s wall, is used primarily by one of the sons’ brides that
lives in the household. The kitchen in Tolly included a functioning
tandir and an old tandir. Several ochocks in Tolly are concentrated
in a small area (3  2 m) outdoors. We noted that kitchen walls are
covered by thick black soot, especially above and around ochocks,
probably due to the combination of oil and soot following frying
activities. Installation internal walls and close to openings are also
blackened by soot (Figs. 4 and 5).
Fuel materials, primarily wood and dung, are stored indoors.
Wood fuel in Sivasoy is mostly poplar (Populus sp.) while in Tolly it
is mostly mulberry (Morus sp.). Dung in different stages of preparation (into ‘dung cakes’) is present around the household, on
house walls or in the cow and sheep sheds (Fig. 6). When ready
(dry), dung cakes are stored in the fuel storage area together with
wood, and other materials not necessarily related to fuel (Fig. 6). In
Sivasoy dung cake preparation takes place inside the cow-shed
during the winter where the cakes are stuck on the internal
walls to dry. During the summer the cows are herded away from
the household, in grazing grounds at high elevations in the
mountains. Dung cakes are prepared on the ground at the summer
camp and are brought back to the village in a car. In principle dung
cakes are said to be stored for winter use only. The wife of the
house owner at Sivasoy complained that her brides tend to use
dung also in the summer. The informant in Tolly prefers using
wood over dung because she perceives the former as cleaner and
better smelling.
Baking and cooking are solely the domain of women. Dough is
prepared by mixing ﬂour, water and some yeast (commercially
bought) in a large metal bowl. When the dough is ready it is shaped
into balls and laid to leaven. The leavened dough is worked into ﬂat
“cakes” of approximately 30 cm in diameter. The dough cakes are
then perforated using a wooden device. Approximately 10e20
bread cakes are prepared in a baking episode and last for about 3
days in an extended family of ca. 10e15 people.
Despite difference in the orientation of tandir ovens in the two
villages, bread baking is similar. Fire is lit within the tandir using
dry grass or small branches followed by insertion of wood, dung
cakes, or both. The ﬁre is fueled so that high ﬂames are created as
well as much smoke. At this point the tandir walls are covered by
black soot. The fuel is mixed occasionally with a metal pole until it
is thoroughly turning into embers. According to the informants, the
indication that it is time to insert the dough is when the soot on the
tandir internal walls is completely burnt away. The dough cakes are
then sprinkled with water, placed on a round textile cushion and
the wet surface is stuck onto the tandir walls using an arm

protection made from a sleeve of an old coat (Fig. 4d). While the
bread is baking it is occasionally sprayed with water to prevent it
from burning. Dough placed in the lower part of the tandir wall is
more prone to burning. The heat in this part of the tandir is
controlled by covering the embers in certain localities of too high a
temperature with cold ash or a piece of metal to decrease the heat.
In cases the heat at the lower part of the tandir is not sufﬁcient for
proper baking, embers were shifted closer to the dough to locally
elevate the temperature. Sometimes the main opening of the tandir
was covered by a metal utensil in order to keep the heat within.
When the bread is ready it is pulled out from the walls and slightly
wiped with some water.
We observed only preparation of meat stews in the ochocks. The
cooking of meat stew was very similar in both households and
started by heating some oil followed by addition of potato slices,
peppers, onions and meat. Water was then added and the stew was
left to boil for about 30e60 min. We noticed that once cooking or
baking activities ceased a kettle was always placed on the embers to
boil water for tea (Fig. 4e).
3.2. Field experiments
Table 2 details the type and amount of fuel used in each
experiment and the time elapsing between initial ﬁre lighting and
end of cooking.
The temperature measured during the experiments in the
ochocks shows a fast increase in the space (from ambient temperature to 600e700  C in 10 min or less). The space temperature
was unstable when wood was used as fuel, ﬂuctuating upwards
each time more wood was added (Fig. 7a.1). When dung was used
as fuel the space temperature rose as fast as using wood, but was
kept steadier over time (Fig. 7a.2). The temperature measured
within the burning fuel rose slower than the temperature in the
space (from ambient temperature to 400e800  C in 10e30 min),
and was kept relatively stable over time, slowly decreasing after the
initial increase (Fig. 7a.3). Note that temperatures were measured
also after the cooking activity was completed.
There does not appear to be a difference in temperature
behavior in the tandir space when used with wood or dung
(Fig. 7b.1). The wood produces a fast rise of relatively high temperature (700e800  C in 25 min at Sivasoy, and 10 min at Tolly).
The use of dung also produced a fast increase of temperature but it
did not reach more than 600  C. The temperature behavior
measured within the tandirs fuel also shows a fast increase, but
stays relatively steady between 400 and 500  C, without signiﬁcant
differences between wood and dung (Fig. 7b.2).

Table 2
A list of the ﬁeld experiments conducted using the two types of fuel in the two
installation types at the two studied households. Experiment #6 started with
glowing embers at the tandir due to previous use of this installation on the same day.
The thermometer that was placed in the space of the tandir in experiment #7 disfunctioned after 20 min. The time column indicates time measured from the
beginning of ﬁre to the end of cooking (i.e., until the food is taken out of the installations). Note that the temperature measurements presented in Fig. 7 continued
after the food was taken out of the installations.

room, including its un-swept ﬂoor. (c) A section in the Sivasoy household midden

3.3. FTIR
FTIR spectra of samples collected from walls of installations
were used to assess the level of clay and calcite alteration due to
exposure to heat, based on the experimental data we produced in
the laboratory (Fig. 3a).
Two ochocks were sampled in Sivasoy and three at Tolly. Samples taken from inner walls at the lower parts of the walls included

heat-altered clay in the range of 500e600  C in both Sivasoy and
Tolly (Fig. 3b.1). Samples collected from the top part of ochocks
inner walls did not include heated clay, except for one sample from
Sivasoy. Samples taken from exterior walls of the various ochocks
showed no signs of clay alteration due to heat (Fig. 3b.2), even when
heavily sooted, except for one sample from Tolly. In all ash samples
collected inside the ochocks the clay fraction showed signs of
exposure to very high temperatures ranging between 700  C and
900  C. In three of these seven ash samples calcium hydroxide
(Ca(OH)2) was present, supporting exposure to temperatures as
high as 800e900  C (Fig. 3b.3).
Tandir walls should be intact in order to carry out baking. This
limited the number of samples collected and focused the sampling
mostly in areas already cracked within the tandirs. In Sivasoy,
tandir inner walls were exposed to 500e900  C both at the bottom
(close to the installation ﬂoor where the fuel was located), as well
as higher on the back wall. At Tolly the clay in the inner walls at the
bottom was not altered in one case and altered at about 600  C in
the other and a sample taken from the interior wall at the opening
of the old tandir contained unaltered clay. Five out of six samples
from the ﬂoors of Tolly’s tandirs included clay minerals that were
altered at temperatures in the range of 400e500  C.
All exterior walls of installations from both villages showed no
signs for heat-altered clay. The clay fraction in the ash samples
collected from inside the tandirs showed alteration due to exposure
to temperatures in the range of 700e900  C, one sample also
contained calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) that supports exposure to
such high temperatures. Anhydrite (CaSO4) was identiﬁed on the
interior walls of all tandirs.
3.4. Quantities of ash pseudomorphs, dung spherulites and
phytoliths
Quantities of ash pseudomorphs, dung spherulites and phytoliths were ﬁrst determined in fuel materials collected in both
households. These materials, including wood, cow dung and sheep/
goat dung, were ashed in laboratory controlled conditions (500  C
for 4 h) and served as standards in this study (Table 3). Using the
information of weight percentage left from each fuel material after
burning, the quantities of the three micro-remains were calculated
per 1 g of organic fuel material, i.e., before burning (Table 3). Wood
standards had no dung spherulites, as expected, variably high

amounts of ash pseudomorphs (7 and 17 million in 1 g organic fuel
material), and low quantities of phytoliths. Pseudomorphs included
rhombs, prisms and occasionally druses. Two cow dung and one
sheep/goat dung standards contained low amounts of ash pseudomorphs (1.2 and 1.7 million in 1 g organic fuel material), while
the other sheep/goat dung standard contained about 5 million ash
pseudomorphs. These differences reﬂect diverse dietary habits of
animals (Cowlishaw and Alder, 1960; Meyer et al., 1957). Pseudomorphs included rhombs, prisms and occasionally druses, and
notably no styloids or raphides (the latter typical of monocot
plants). Both sheep/goat dung standards contain more spherulites
than cow dung. Phytolith quantities in the fuel standards range
between 0.04 and 0.07 million per 1 g of wood and between 7 and
15 million per 1 g of dung (Table 3).

Quantities of micro-remains in the standard fuel materials were
used to calculate their expected amounts in 1 g of ash left after
burning theoretical mixtures of wood and dung, taking into account the different weight loss of each sample (Table 4).
3.4.1. Modeling phytolith concentrations vs. a Pseudomorphs/
Spherulites Ratio (PSR)
Plotting the three parameters of micro-remains present in the
fuel materials was simpliﬁed by calculation of a Pseudomorphs/
Spherulites Ratio (hereafter PSR). This value takes advantage of the
facts that wood does not contain dung spherulites and has low
phytolith concentrations while dung contains variable amounts of
wood ash pseudomorphs, dung spherulites and phytoliths
depending on livestock diet (for a detailed explanation see Section

Quantities of phytoliths, ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites in clean and pure (standard) wood and dung fuels from Sivasoy and Tolly. The weight loss due to burning was
used in order to calculate the amount of the micro-remains in 1 g of the organic matter. The last column gives the PSR values in each material. Note that although we rely here
on 4 dung samples only, the spherulite concentration in these samples is consistent with previous studies where spherulites have been quantiﬁed from modern dung ash
(Shahack-Gross and Finkelstein, 2008).

4.4) (Table 3). A two-dimensional plot of PSR and phytolith concentrations was thus built in which the values of ashed standards
and their theoretical mixtures (Table 4) can be easily appreciated
(Fig. 8a,b). It can be seen that pure wood ash does not have a PSR
value because it does not contain spherulites, however, if we
arbitrarily consider the presence of 1 dung spherulite in pure wood
ash, PSR values can be calculated and they are in the range of
hundreds of millions. For such pure wood ash, phytolith concentrations are low (below 2 million phytoliths per 1 g ash) and it plots
at the far lower right of the graph (Fig. 8a). Pure dung, with high or
low dung spherulite content, plots at the upper/middle left part of
the graph having distinctively low PSR values (always below 1) and
phytolith concentrations above 20 million in 1 g ash (Fig. 8a). For
comparison, the values obtained from a local soil sample are
plotted as well, falling at the lower left part of the graph (i.e., low
amounts of all micro-remains; Fig. 8a). A clear separation in values
between pure wood and pure dung ashes is thus evident.
When mixtures of wood and dung are used to fuel an installation, mixing curves are expected to form between PSR values and
between phytolith concentrations. We calculated such mixtures

using standard dung and wood samples from the study area
(Table 4). Mixing wood with spherulite-rich dung forms a steep
mixing curve (Fig. 8b) indicating that very large amounts of wood
are required to shift the dung signature away from a PSR value
lower than 1, and phytolith concentrations decrease rapidly. Mixing
wood with spherulite-poor dung (Fig. 8b) forms a moderately
sloping mixing curve that requires lower amounts of wood to shift
the dung signature from PSR value lower than 1 while phytolith
concentrations do not change drastically. We note that large
amounts of wood relative to dung are required to obtain PSR values
of 10 and above, thus any PSR value above 10 indicates wood as the
major fuel component. Interpretation of samples with PSR values
between 1 and 10 having low phytolith concentrations (below 20
million in 1 g ash) is most difﬁcult because it cannot be concluded
with certainty whether such values represent well-preserved
samples, predominance of wood ash, predominance of dung ash,
or ash mixed with soil material. We therefore deﬁne this range as “a
gray area” (Fig. 8b). The patterns presented in Fig. 8b thus serve as a
quantitative model that allows approaching interpretation of unknown fuel sources.

phytolith concentrations. A soil sample plots in a distinctively different area relative to the two ash types. (b) PSR vs. phytolith concentrations in calculated mixtures of wood and

black diamonds represent mixtures of wood with spherulite-poor dung. Mixtures between these two end members create distinctive mixing curves. PSR values above 10 indicate
predominance of wood ash while PSR values below 1 indicate predominance of dung ash. PSR values between 1 and 10 associated with phytolith concentrations lower than 20
million in 1 g ash, are difﬁcult to assign to a speciﬁc fuel origin (“gray area”). These data serve as an empirical model for interpretation of ashes from ethnographic installations and
middens, and consequently archaeological sediments. (c) A plot showing the PSR vs. phytolith concentrations in ethnoarchaeological wood ash (gray triangles), dung ash (black

phytolith concentrations.

3.4.2. PSR and phytolith values in ethnographic ashes of known fuel
materials
Quantities of ash pseudomorphs, dung spherulites and phytoliths were determined in fresh wood and dung ash samples from
cooking experiments, four control soil samples, and sediment
samples collected from the household midden at Sivasoy (Table 5).
Ash pseudomorph quantities are higher in installations fueled by
wood, and dung spherulite quantities are higher in installations
fueled by dung (Table 5). While there is a general higher quantity of
phytoliths in ethnographic dung ashes (8e17 million per 1 g of
dung ash) vs. those in wood ash (5e10.5 million per 1 g of wood
ash) these quantities overlap.
Fig. 8c shows the results from the ethnographic ashes. All but 1
of the wood ash samples (Table 5) have PSR values well above 10
and low-medium quantities (5e10.5 million per 1 g ash) of phytoliths, placing them in the expected range for wood ash. Dung ash
samples have PSR values lower than 1, and medium quantities of
phytoliths (8e17 million per 1 g ash). Despite the relatively low
phytolith concentrations, the PSR value clearly indicates a dung ash
origin. The results obtained from the ashes of known fuel thus
support the usefulness of the PSR and phytolith concentration plot.
We note that all ethnographic wood ash samples contain dung
spherulites and that phytolith concentrations in ethnographic dung
ash samples are lower than expected. This indicates that certain
other taphonomic processes occur (see Discussion).

3.5. Phytolith morphologies

3.4.3. PSR and phytolith values in ethnographic ashes of unknown
fuel sources
The usefulness of the PSR to phytolith-concentration plot was
tested on ashy sediments of an unknown fuel origin in the form of a
layered midden at the Sivasoy household (Fig. 6c, Table 5). One
sample had no dung spherulites and 1.7 million ash pseudomorphs
per 1 g sediment, and therefore was unequivocally identiﬁed as
wood ash. One sample, having a PSR value well above 10 and low
phytolith concentrations is safely interpreted as wood ash. Two
samples have PSR values below 1 and the highest phytolith concentrations indicating they originate primarily from dung ash.
Three samples fell within the “gray area”.

4.1. Identiﬁcation of archaeological cooking installations

Differentiating wood from dung ash using phytolith morphologies is based on the premise that monocot phytoliths will be more
abundant in dung as it is mainly composed of digested grass, while
dicot phytoliths will be more abundant in wood and bark. Past
research showed that monocots not only produce up to 20 times
more phytoliths than dicot wood and bark and 16 times more
phytoliths than dicot leaves, they are also present as an exterior
contamination on dicot bark (Albert et al., 2003). All samples
studied, including fresh wood and dung ashes as well as sediments
from the Sivasoy household midden, contain phytoliths of both
monocots and dicots. Both wood and dung ash samples are variable
in the relative proportions of monocots/dicots (Fig. 9). We note that
certain wood and dung ash samples may have similar phytolith
morphotype compositions. The phytolith morphotype analysis in
this ethnographic case study does not contribute to distinguishing
between the two fuel types (see explanation in Section 4.4).
4. Discussion
The study presented here touches upon issues related to
archaeological inferences associated with cooking. It relates to the
mere identiﬁcation of installations as used for cooking, to their use
temperatures and fueling materials.

A basic question often encountered during excavation is
whether installations that resemble cooking installations recorded
ethnographically were indeed used for cooking in the past. In most
publications we found that interpreting certain features as cooking
installations relies mostly on resemblance based on the form/shape
of archaeological installations to ethnographic ones (e.g., Parker,
2011). Sometimes these interpretations are supported by context.
We would like to emphasize that ashes within archaeological installations cannot be used as an indicator for in situ burning that
occurred within the installation because ashes may have been

discarded into unused installations that served for purposes not
related to ﬁre, such as storage.
In order to approach the question whether certain archaeological installations have been used with ﬁre, the FTIR analyses of
installation walls, presented in this study, is very useful. We show
that in both tandirs and ochocks the outer side of the installation
walls were not affected by heat, while the inner walls were affected
by heat so that they contained evidence for alteration of calcite and
clay minerals in temperatures in the range of 500e900  C, similar
to temperatures recorded by us during cooking practices.
We note that the degree of clay alteration is variable on the
installations’ inner walls (i.e., 70% of the inner wall samples
included altered clay), possibly reﬂecting the inconsistent behavior
of ﬁre within installations during different use episodes. This
observation indicates that when sampling an archaeological
installation in order to test whether it was used with ﬁre, sampling
strategy should consider the amount of samples and their location
on the installation’s inner and outer walls.
Once an archaeological installation has been proven to include
heat-altered clay on its internal walls, it may be interpreted as a
cooking installation also considering its archaeological context.
Note that kilns may also produce similar patterns, but their
archaeological context is expected to differ from that of domestic
cooking installations. Such positive identiﬁcation allows going into
the next stage of inference, i.e., estimation of cooking temperature
and identiﬁcation of fueling materials.
4.2. Estimating cooking temperatures
Our results show that the temperatures recorded by clay alteration on tandir inner walls are in the range of 700e900  C. However,
we noted that the actual baking was done only after the temperature
dropped to 250e300  C. Thus it appears that in baking ovens clay
alteration records the initial heating of the oven space and walls
prior to actual baking. The temperatures recorded on ochock inner
walls are in the range of 500e600  C while the maximum temperatures recorded at the base of the cooking pot during food preparation were up to 700  C. We note that such high temperatures lasted

for short periods of time (no longer than 15 min per installation
operation) during the cooking activity. This observation indicates
that the installation walls could not have been thoroughly heated
which may explain the lower temperatures recorded on ochock inner walls relative to tandir inner walls. As cooking in the ochock
involved liquids (oil, water) the danger of food burning is lower than
during baking. This allows cooking at high ﬁre temperatures. We
noted that after the initial frying, at high temperature, simmering of
stews occurred at lower temperatures accompanied by stopping the
addition of fuel into the cooking installation, which allowed for a
slow decrease in cooking temperature with time.
We noted that soot forms during the initial stages of combustion, and is later partially oxidized. Soot is oxidized when in direct
contact with ﬂames within the cooking installations, however,
some soot may remain close to the openings of cooking installations e ventilation holes, tandir mouth, and ochock sides.
Thick accumulation of oily soot was recorded on walls above
ochocks where frying activities took place. The chances of preservation of these patterns were not studied by us.
4.3. Fuel selection, preferences and efﬁciency
Several factors determining fuel selection in rural environments
have been identiﬁed in past research, among them availability, cost
(in time and/or money), fuel efﬁciency and fuel redundancy (i.e., if
the fuel material is not needed to other purposes as building material or fertilizer) (Davis, 1995; Gwavuya et al., 2012; Hoeck et al.,
2007; Hosier and Dowd, 1987; Joon et al., 2009). Availability primarily relates to the environment, whether it is wooded or arid,
and to the economic base of the residents (i.e., whether or not
keeping livestock that supplies dung). Another interesting factor
that affects fuel choice is cultural such as the Maasai general
avoidance from using dung for cooking as it is regarded ‘un-clean’
(Shahack-Gross et al., 2004) or the taboo on using speciﬁc tree
species among the Fang villagers in Equatorial Guinea (Picornell
Gelabert et al., 2011).
Fuel selection in the study area seemed to have been primarily
guided by availability. The sparsely wooded nature of the

S. Gur-Arieh et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 40 (2013) 4331e4347

environment coupled with herd keeping favors the use of dung over
wood. This tendency has been previously observed in other rural arid
areas such as Iran (Kramer, 1982; Miller, 1984b). In the study area
wood was mostly used during the summer while dung was prepared
as dry cakes and stored for use during the winter. Yet, there was no
strict seasonal separation as personal preferences also play a role.
Fuel energetic efﬁciency may also play a role in decisions
regarding which fuel to use during cooking. Looking at the results
of our cooking experiments it is hard to point out the more efﬁcient fuel (Table 2). When using the same amount of wood vs.
dung in the same ochock at Sivasoy, the whole process lasted
30 min less with the dung, but then in the ochock in Tolly it took
1.1 kg more dung for the same time of cooking (about 50 min).
When looking at the tandir experiments we see that in both cases
baking with dung as fuel required larger amounts (15 kg more at
Sivasoy, and 3 kg more at Tolly) and also lasted longer (23 min
longer at Sivasoy, and 20 min at Tolly). Note that tandir volumes in
both villages are about the same. On the other hand comparing the
span of time the temperature stays above 500  C we see that in all
cases the dung is more efﬁcient (11 min more in average with the
ochock, and 7.5 min more with the tandir). Taken together, the
heterogeneity of the results suggests that from an energetic point
of view, there is not much difference between dung and wood as
fuel materials.
4.4. Identifying fuel materials
Fuel identiﬁcation in archaeological sites helps reconstruct the
environment (climate and ﬂora), and it can provide evidence for
animal husbandry. Previous studies either rely on the analysis of
charred macro-remains (e.g., Miller et al., 2009), on micromorphological identiﬁcation of wood ash (e.g., Mentzer and Quade,
2013 and references therein), or on morphological and quantitative analysis of phytoliths and dung spherulites (e.g., Katz et al.,
2007; Portillo et al., 2009).
In this study we developed a method for the simultaneous
quantiﬁcation of ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites. The
method is accurate and reproducible (11% error for ash pseudomorphs and 30% error for dung spherulites). Analysis of the ethnoarchaeological ash samples of known origin showed that in both
wood and dung ashes ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites
were present. The presence of wood ash pseudomorphs in herbivore dung is explained as resulting from livestock consumption of
bark and dicot leaves as well as certain monocots that contain
calcium oxalate crystals (Prychid and Rudall, 1999). On the other
hand, the presence of dung spherulites in wood ash can only be
explained in relation to human behavior, i.e., that mixing between
wood and dung ashes occurs within the installations, despite
(almost) daily removal of ashes. We observed that ash removal was
done haphazardly, without care for cleanliness but care for space
for the next batch of fuel. Thus ash from former uses was often
mixed with newly forming ashes, and in the case of tandirs these
were manually mixed together by the cooks with a metal pole, as
part of the baking process and not due to the use of different fuels
together.
We note that Canti (1999) reported absence of spherulites in
dung of certain animals, including sheep. Theoretically, such
random examples of zero spherulites in dung will result in a PSR
value typical of wood ash, further leading to an erroneous identiﬁcation of dung ash as wood ash. However, because dung cakes are
produced from a mixture of sheep, goat and cow dung, it will be
rare (if not impossible) to envision fueling a cooking installation
with dung that does not contain any spherulites.
Quantiﬁcation of dung spherulites and ash pseudomorphs in
ashes of known origin showed that spherulite-rich dung is more

4345

prevalent than spherulite-poor dung, making the latter’s mixing
curve (Fig. 8b) irrelevant in this ethnographic case study. In order to
shift the PSR value characteristic of dung ash (lower than 1) into the
wood ash range (PSR higher than 10) quite intensive mixing is
required (about 60 times more wood than dung; Table 4). The PSR
values obtained from ethnographic dung ash are restricted in range
(between 0 and 1) while PSR values for ethnographic wood ash are
spread across a wide range (3e900) (Fig. 8c). These values reﬂect
variable degrees of mixing between wood and dung ashes. We
deﬁned a “gray area”, ranging between PSR values of 1 and 10 and
phytolith concentration that is less than 20 million per 1 g ash,
indicating a range of values that in an archaeological case will be
difﬁcult to supply a clear-cut inference as to the fuel source. The
“gray area” reﬂects intensive mixing in which one cannot differentiate whether both fuel materials have been used together or
whether mixing occurred due to rake-out activities. We noted that
rake out is intended simply to clear the installation space rather
than keeping it clean, thus ashes from previous use episodes
remain at the installation’s bottom and will mix with ash that forms
in later use episodes. Other types of mixing may also result in
obtaining values in the “gray area” (see Section 4.5 below).
Our results indicate that phytolith analysis by itself is not sensitive enough to identify fuel origin in the case of fuel mixtures,
even when combining both phytolith concentration and morphological analyses. Theoretically, wood/bark can be distinguished
from grasses based on morphotype composition. However, we note
that human behavior may obscure this theoretical separation. First,
we observed that each cooking event begins with starting a ﬁre
using grasses and small twigs. As monocots (grasses) produce more
phytoliths than wood and bark, it is expected that in all ashes
produced in cooking installations monocot phytoliths will be more
abundant, even if the main fueling material was wood. Second, an
important observation we made is the mixing that occurs at
installation bases in relation to incomplete ash rake-out between
consecutive cooking events. A good example is the comparison
between sample SUZ 155 originating from wood ash and sample
SUZ 167 originating from dung ash. Both contain ca. 7e8 million
phytoliths in 1 g ash, of which about 80% are from monocots and
10e15% from dicots (Table 5, Fig. 9). In the absence of quantitative
spherulite and pseudomorph data, both samples will be interpreted
as originating from dung with some dicot contribution. However,
when considering the PSR values of these samples, it is clear that
SUZ 155 is predominantly wood ash with PSR value of 22, while
SUZ 167 is dung ash with PSR value of 0.01. Thus the PSR e phytolith quantity combination is very powerful for identiﬁcation of
the predominant ash origin.
When applying the new method to ash of unknown origins in
the Sivasoy midden, we were able to assign with high certainty 4
out of the 7 samples analyzed to their speciﬁc fuel sources. Future
research will be carried out in order to better understand the
meaning of samples possessing PSR and phytolith concentrations
values that plot in the so-called “gray area”.
4.5. Taphonomic considerations
As noted above, the “gray area” between PSR values 1 and 10
indicates much mixing between wood and dung fuel/ashes. Can it
also result from taphonomic changes? Considering that these
micro-remains are calcitic, they are soluble in acidic conditions. It is
possible that one of them is more soluble than the other. Future
experiments are designed to test this taphonomic possibility. In
addition, we postulate possible mixing of ashes with other types of
sediments e possibly clayey materials from the installations’ walls
and soil material in the Sivasoy dumped ashes. This possibility
should also be studied in more detail in the future.

5. Summary and conclusions
In this study we have dealt with questions concerning the
identiﬁcation of cooking installations, reconstructing temperature
ranges within them and identifying fuel materials that were used to
operate them. Archaeologists identify certain features to be cooking
installations based on analogies of form and context of the
archaeological installations to ethnographic ones. These identiﬁcations are usually supported by the discovery of ashes within installations without considering alternative processes that might
have led to the presence of non in-situ ash inside installations that
were not originally related to ﬁre use (such as ash discarded into
storage bins that went out of use). This study adds another tool for
identiﬁcation of cooking installations, namely the identiﬁcation of
heat-altered minerals (clay, calcite) on their inner walls. This can be
easily and efﬁciently done using FTIR analyses, which can also be
done directly at the archaeological site using portable FTIR spectrometers (Weiner, 2010). The study reported below contributes to
the research of cooking installations worldwide, regardless of the
speciﬁc environment, speciﬁc installation shapes and speciﬁc
subsistence practices of its inhabitants. This study focuses on the
physical and chemical attributes of materials used in a traditional
society. The patterns that will be described below rely on universal
laws in chemistry and physics of materials (a materials science
approach). For example, the way wood or dung burn in Uzbekistan
is just the same as they will burn almost anywhere else around the
world (i.e., except for high altitude areas that are oxygen deﬁcient).
Similarly, the way that heat within an Uzbek installation affects the
chemistry of its walls is expected to be similar in cooking installations elsewhere around the world. Therefore, the patterns
reported in this study can be applied to most other places on the
globe.
Our results show that the temperatures recorded by clay alteration on tandir inner walls (700e900  C) reﬂect the initial heating
of the oven prior to actual baking, the latter done at 250e300  C.
The temperatures recorded on ochock inner walls (500e600  C)
better match actual cooking temperatures (700  C and lower). We
also found that wood and dung burn alike during the operation of
the studied installations.
The method developed for the quantiﬁcation of ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites was proved to be accurate and
reproducible. We introduced the plot of PSR vs. phytolith concentration in ashes and determined experimentally that almost pure
wood ash is characterized by PSR values above 10 and phytolith
concentrations below 1 million in 1 g ash. Pure dung ash is characterized by PSR values lower than 1 and more than 20 million
phytoliths in 1 g ash. The ethnographic ashes studied did not always fall within these distinctive ranges, indicating that mixing
processes between fuel sources occur. Ashes with PSR values between 1 and 10 and phytolith concentrations below 20 million in
1 g ash fall into a “gray area” were intensive mixing occurred and
thus interpretation as to the dominant fuel source is highly
uncertain.
Mixing processes became evident primarily by the presence of
dung spherulites in ash from installations fueled by wood only. We
explain this phenomenon as primarily reﬂecting human behavior e
either by consciously using different fuel types in the same burning
event, or by unconsciously mixing the different fuel ashes in relation to rake-out activities.
Lastly, we noted that phytolith morphotype analysis was surprisingly not useful in distinguishing between fuel sources. The
reasons are probably (a) the original variability in livestock diet and
thus in certain cases resemblance of dung phytoliths to dicotdominated wood ash, and (b) the mixing that occurs within
installation bottoms. We suggest that this observation should be

taken as a caution by phytolith specialists working at agricultural
and agro-pastoral contexts. We believe that for most sites predating the Neolithic such caution is less signiﬁcant (but see for
example Miller et al., 2009).
