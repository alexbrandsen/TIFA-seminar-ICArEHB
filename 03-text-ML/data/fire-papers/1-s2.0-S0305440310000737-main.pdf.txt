Pollen analysis reveals vegetation change on a local and regional level over (ideally) continuous time
spans but with complications when it comes to the reconstruction of spatially precise species occurrence
and composition. Wood charcoal analysis provides site-related information on species occurrence and
woodland composition, especially when sediments containing pollen are lacking, but is normally
discontinuously available and has the danger of human bias due to potential selection of certain species
for e.g. ﬁre making, house construction or charcoal making. Combining the two methods e assuming that
suitable palaeoarchives are neighbouring e might compensate for their disadvantages and strengthen
the interpretations on vegetation composition and dynamics on a local, extra-local and regional scale.
Three examples are given where pollen analysis from “classical” archives e mires and lake sediments e
was carried out, and where additionally species identiﬁcation of wood charcoals was done on samples
extracted from close-by archives. The ﬁrst example (Kugelstattmoos, Bavarian Forest, Germany)
combines a Holocene pollen diagram derived from a small mire with late medieval/early modern times
charcoal spectra from charcoal production sites which are situated on the margin of the mire. Results
show the local occurrence of the main woodland species Fagus sylvatica and Abies alba, and raises new
questions on the montane species composition of the formerly natural forests in the Bavarian Forest. The
second example (Bargstedter Moor, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany) combines Holocene pollen diagrams
from a peat bog with late medieval/early modern times charcoal spectra from charcoal production sites
in a woodland close to the bog. It shows the role of Quercus, Fagus, Alnus and Carpinus in medieval and
early modern times woodlands and its use by man. The third example (Kleiner Tornowsee, Brandenburg,
Germany) combines pollen data from sediments of a small lake with charcoal data derived from Holocene colluvisols and soils. The examples show that anthracological and palynological data complement
one another to create a more detailed picture of woodland history and landscape change than one
method alone would provide.

1. Introduction
For the investigation of palaeovegetation and its dynamics in
interaction with human impact, a lot of palaeoecological studies
use either pollen analysis (palynology) or wood charcoal analysis
(anthracology). Compared to the vast available publications which
present palynological data and the increasingly number of papers

which present anthracological records, only few studies use both
methods (e.g. Leroyer and Heinz, 1992; Speier, 1994; Smettan, 1995;
Emery-Barbier and Thiébault, 2005; Hildebrandt et al., 2007;
Newman et al., 2007). This might be related to the history of
Quaternary palaeobotanical research, where certain schools focus
either on palynology or on anthracology. Both methods have
advantages and disadvantages (Fig. 1). Pollen analysis enables us to
identify occurrences and relative changes with a high taxonomical
resolution, encompassing both tree and herb species, higher plants
and cryptogams (e.g. Faegri and Iversen, 1989; Beug, 2004, 2005),
and an increasing ability of identifying and interpreting non-pollen
palynomorphs (e.g. van Geel et al., 2003). Depending on archive
quality, pollen analysis also enables to work diachronically, and
depending on archive size it gives the possibility of reconstructing
local and/or regional vegetation diachronically. However, there is

still intensive debate as to which amount of pollen grains of certain
species can be interpreted as local or extra-local occurrences of the
plants (e.g. Gaillard et al., 2008a,b).
Wood charcoal analysis provides site-related information on
species occurrence and woodland composition, depending on the
archive context. The method can provide information on woodland
composition on a local scale, including stand structure information.
The analysis of charred wood is of special interest in regions or on
sites where sediments containing pollen are lacking, thus providing
the only source to reconstruct (woody) vegetation. But stratigraphical and taphonomic issues are more complicated. The legacy
of the remains is normally only discontinuously available. The
species spectra when interpreted for vegetation reconstruction
have the danger of human bias due to potential selection of certain
species, for e.g. ﬁre making, house construction or charcoal making
(Asouti and Austin, 2005).
Combining the two methods e assuming that suitable palaeoarchives are neighbouring e might compensate for their disadvantages and strengthen the interpretations on vegetation
composition and dynamics on a local, extra-local and regional scale.
So the hypothesis to follow up is: combination of methods and
archives brings better scenarios of past vegetation composition and
dynamics, and past interaction of humans and their environment.
Three examples from different areas and geographical situations
in Germany (Fig. 2; Bavarian Forest in Southeastern Germany,
Schleswig-Holstein in Northern Germany, and Brandenburg in
Eastern Germany) are given where pollen analysis from “classical”
archives e mires and lake sediments e was carried out, and where
additionally species identiﬁcation of wood charcoals was done on
samples extracted from neighbouring archives. The aim of the
studies was to investigate woodland composition and management/usage in interaction with people using wood as a resource for
different purposes, or transforming woodland into pastures or
agricultural ﬁelds. The action of man might have opened up the
woodland, and/or might have altered the species composition, e.g.
intentionally or unintentionally promoting certain species by
establishing a coppice.

establishment of organised forestry since some 150e200 years ago,
together with beech (Fagus sylvatica) and ﬁr (Abies alba). The submontane and montane area was settled since medieval times.
Before that, archaeological ﬁnds indicate some presence of people,
but no settlement activity in the montane areas. The mire started to
develop around the transition Late Glacial/early Holocene and
accumulated a maximum of 4 m of peat until today. Pollen analysis
was done for the complete Holocene, but for the purpose of the
here addressed question we composed a simpliﬁed pollen diagram
of the upper 1.15 m of the sequence.
In the vicinity, we found several charcoal kiln sites (Fig. 4). Five
are very close to the pollen proﬁle, on the margin of the mire, thus
their charcoal record can be compared to the pollen diagram. In one
km distance, close to the summit of the mountain range, four sites

2. Study areas and sample sites
2.1. Kugelstattmoos (Bavarian Forest)
Kugelstattmoos is a small mire with ca. 20 ha in 870 m a.s.l. in
the western part of the Bavarian Forest (48 570 1100 N, 12 5102900 E).
The climate in the region is suboceanic, with ca. 4  C mean annual
temperature and around 1400 mm mean annual precipitation.
Bedrock is metamorphic in character (Gneiss) and is the result of
a Precambrian sedimentation and following metamorphosis. The
resulting soils are base-poor. Todays' vegetation consists predominantly of spruce (Picea abies), which was promoted by the

Tornowsee (Brandenburg, Eastern Germany).

2128

were sampled which record information about the woodland
vegetation in this high montane elevation. The kiln sites can be
recognized as small platforms with a diameter between 6 and 9 m,
and a charcoal-rich soil layer.
2.2. Bargstedter Moor (Schleswig-Holstein)
Situated in the area of the Geest (Saale glacial debris and
Weichselian sand deposits), the raised bog “Bargstedter Moor”
(54 090 N, 9 470 E, SW of Nortorf in Schleswig-Holstein, North
Germany) has an extension of around 5 km2, and is used today in its
central part for agriculture, either as pasture or meadow. Thus the
upper peat is highly decomposed in the centre of the bog, whereas
peat cutting was restricted to the eastern edge. As the only relict of
the former bog vegetation, one 150  50 m “Monotelm” or peat
monolith remained untouched at the SE part of the bog
(54 090 09.300 N, 9 480 22.000 E), thus providing a rare opportunity to
analyse the younger peat sequence because mostly all raised bogs
in the region are either peat-cutted or cultivated. The climate of the
region is suboceanic, with mean annual temperature of 8e8.5  C
and around 800 mm mean annual precipitation. The landscape
today is dominated by agricultural land, with meadows, pastures
and cereal ﬁelds. Only few areas with woodland are present. The
forest vegetation consists either of a broadleaf woodland, with
beech, hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and oak (Quercus robur), and
alder (Alnus glutinosa) on sites close to the groundwater table, or
conifer forests (mostly spruce) were planted. The scarce archaeological record indicates that human activities started from the
Bronze Age onwards, but there are no settlements known before
the village of Bargstedt was mentioned in written sources in the
year 1442 (Martens, 1978). In one relatively big forest area c. 3 km
distant from the pollen site, several charcoal production sites were
sampled for charcoal analysis (54100 07.4400 N, 9 450 49.5700 E), as
well as on an estate in the adjoining village Bargstedt
(54100 01.4300 N, 9 460 27.2500 E) (Dannath and Nelle, 2009).
2.3. Kleiner Tornowsee (Brandenburg)
Kleiner Tornowsee (Small Lake Tornow) is situated 50 km east of
the centre of Berlin, in the “Märkische Schweiz” (52 340 4600 N,
14 050 3600 E). This is a ca. 40 km2 area of relatively high relief in
the area of ground moraine plates. The lake is one of several in the
“Buckower Kessel”, a depression which was formed during the
Weichsel glacial. The lake has a surface area of ca. 3.5 ha and
a catchment size of ca. 32 ha. The largest part of the catchment area is
forested today, with a small area of agricultural ﬁelds in the northern
part. Climate is subcontinental, with 500e560 mm annual precipitation and a mean annual temperature of 8.8  C. The natural vegetation is supposed to be subatlantic-Central European oak forests
(Quercus petraea, Q. robur), partly with Pinus sylvestris, with Calamagrostis arundinacea, Melica nutans, Rubus saxatilis, Orthilia secunda,
or Central European sessile oak-hornbeam forests (Carpinus betulus,
Quercus petraea), mostly with Fagus sylvatica, with Carex montana
and Hepatica nobilis (Bohn et al., 2000). Ten soil exposures were dug
with an excavator at the northern and eastern adjoining slopes of the
lake catchment, to study the colluvial layers which formed due to
erosion. Soil samples were taken according to ﬁeld designation of
layers.
3. Materials and methods
3.1. Charcoal analysis
At the charcoal production sites, a minimum of 100 wood
charcoal fragments were sampled from different parts of the

charcoal-rich layers. Size of collected fragments ranges from
0.25 cm3 up to several cm3 (Nelle, 2002b, 2003). At Kleiner Tornowsee, samples were taken from colluvial layers of the exposures
which were made by an excavator, ranging from 10 to 50 m in
length and up to 3 m in depth. We sampled between 10 l and 20 l of
each layer of the colluvial exposures. The substrate was wet-sieved
(mesh with 1 mm), air-dried and weighted before microscopical
analysis (Dreibrodt et al., 2009).
The identiﬁcation of wood taxa was done with a stereoscope
with magniﬁcation up to 112 (Nikon SMZ 1500) and an incidentlight microscope with magniﬁcation up to 500 (Nikon ME 600,
light and dark ﬁeld) and followed Schweingruber (1990a,b) as well
as the reference collection of charred wood of the Palaeoecology
Research Unit of the Institute for Ecosystem Research. The especially small fragments from the colluvial layers (1e5 mm of size)
were cut manually under the stereoscope at a magniﬁcation of
7.5e10, in order to attain fractured surfaces of transversal,
tangential and radial orientation. The identiﬁed fragments were
again weighed to calculate percentages as numbers as well as
weight. A wood diameter measurement due to the visible growth
ring curvatures and angle of wood rays (Ludemann and Nelle, 2002;
Nelle, 2002a; Ludemann, 2008), was applied when the fragments
had a suitable size, which was only the case with the material from
the kiln sites. In the case of the colluvial layers, the fragments were
too small.
3.2. Pollen analysis
Coring on lake Kleiner Tornowsee took place with a rod-operated piston corer (“Usinger-corer”, Mingram et al., 2007) in July
2005 from a raft. We prepared samples with standard procedures,
including KOH digestion, HF treatment and acetylation (Faegri and
Iversen, 1989; Moore et al., 1991), and with the addition of Lycopodium spore tablets (Stockmarr, 1971). Pollen grains were counted
microscopically at magniﬁcation of 400 to 1000. Microscopic
charcoal particles were counted if their size exceeded 10 mm on the
same slides and calculated as a ratio to Lycopodium marker spores.
Arboreal pollen percentages are based on the sum of the arboreal
pollen, non-arboreal pollen percentages are based on the upland
pollen sum (excluding spores and fen/water plants).
3.3. Radiocarbon dating
Radiocarbon dating of peat samples from the mire Kugelstattmoos was done by the AMS-14C Labor Erlangen, University of
Erlangen (Nelle, 2002b), and those for the pollen records of Bargstedter Moor and Kleiner Tornowsee, as well as the charcoals from
Tornowsee, were analyzed by the Leibniz-Laboratory for Radiometric Dating and Stable Isotope Research, University of Kiel.
Radiocarbon ages were calibrated according to Reimer et al. (2004).
4. Results
4.1. Kugelstattmoos
A simpliﬁed pollen diagram of the upper 1.15 m of the sequence
(Fig. 3; for the complete diagram see Nelle, 2002b) shows the
vegetation development during the last 4500 years. Local pollen
assemblage zone (LPAZ) 6 is characterized by high and constant
values of Fagus (beech) (around 60%), and constant values of Picea
(spruce) and Abies (ﬁr). The woodland is dominated by stands of
Fagus sylvatica, with some admixed trees of Picea abies and Abies
alba. During LPAZ 7, values of Abies and Fagus, as well as Picea are
ﬂuctuating. Fagus rises to its highest percentage (70%). Plantago
lanceolata is now present with very low counts in every sample,

which continues to the end of zone 8. LPAZ 8 (c. 3000e1750 cal. BP)
shows the increase of Abies up to 48%, and the decrease of Fagus,
while other arboreal pollen remain more or less constant. The
increase of Abies might be due to an increased percentage in the
montane beech-ﬁr plant communities, or due to an increased
presence on wet minerotrophic sites around the mire, where Fagus
is striving with diminished competitive ability. The curve of Plantago lanceolata is interrupted. Until the end of this zone, the ratio
arboreal/non-arboreal pollen is around 95/5. With LPAZ 9 e subdivided in 9a and 9b, major changes occur. Abies drops down
remarkably, as well as Fagus, while Betula (birch), Corylus (hazel)
and Alnus (alder) increase. First Picea pollen decreases too, but
starts to rise at the end of zone 9a. Non-arboreal pollen values
increase. The Calluna (heather) curve peaks, and cereal pollen
grains, especially Secale are present. There is also a remarkable
increase of microcharcoal particles in the pollen samples, especially
when looking on the size class >100 mm. These changes indicate an
opening of the forest due to local tree cutting. The increase of the
light-demanding species Betula and Corylus might be due to the
general more open conditions in the woodland, or due to
a progressive establishment on the mire, which is supported by
small wood fragments ﬁnds in this level. The 14C-AMS result dates
the level to the Roman period. It is very doubtful that this is a right
dating, since the pollen spectra ﬁts better to medieval or early
modern times human impact, if looked on the so far known onset of
settlement activities in the area (beginning of cultivation of Secale,
using higher montane areas for cattle pasture, etc.). The arboreal
species spectra of zone 9a are thus chronologically comparable to
the charcoal production which happened only around 20 m
distance from the coring site, on the margin of the mire.
The charcoal production sites around Hirschenstein are of the
rectangular kiln type, a charring technique which replaced the
charring in pits around the transition from medieval to modern
times. This provides a terminus post quem. On the other hand, the
trees on and around the sites are c. 100e120 years old, thus
providing a terminus ante quem. Since the charcoal fragments in
the soil are of comparably small size, the sites are small in diameter

and the state of preservation is moderate, they most likely date to
the end of the Medieval or the early modern times, i.e. 15th to 17th
century AD. Though no radiocarbon dates are available, the
comparison to absolutely dated charcoal kiln sites makes a relative
dating possible (Nelle, 2003). Two comparable sites which belong
to another kiln site ensemble in the Bavarian Forest had calibrated
14
C-AMS dates of 1329e1477 AD and 1410e1617 AD.
Apart from one, all kiln sites show Fagus-dominated spectra
(Fig. 4). The ﬁve sites very close to the Kugelstattmoos mire have
Abies-percentages from 8 to 16%, with some fragments of Picea. Also
Alnus is found in two of the sites on the mire margin. The four sites
around the top of Hirschenstein had only one fragment of Abies and
Picea, respectively, out of 425 fragments analyzed. Acer (maple) was
found in nearly all kiln site layers, but with low percentages. Acer
pseudoplatanus is a constituent of the beech-maple plant communities (Aceri-Fagetum) common in montane elevation.
4.2. Bargstedter Moor
The pollen diagram (Fig. 5) spans approximately the last 1500
years. One radiocarbon sample shows that peat formation around
39 cm happened during high medieval times. High arboreal pollen
values indicate that the landscape was dominated by woodland,
which consisted of Fagus, Quercus (oak) and Carpinus (hornbeam).
Alnus was formerly more present, but drainage of wet sites and
clear-cutting of groundwater close sites for the establishment of
meadows and pastures diminished the proportion of the species. It
is only in the upper part of the proﬁle that anthropogenic indicators
gain signiﬁcant percentages. This indicates an opening of the
landscape due to human settlement activity, which happened
during early modern times.
The charcoal production sites close to the Bargstedter Moor in
Barloher Forst were used during the 16th to 18th century. One site
which today lies on an estate in the small village of Bargstedt was
still a charcoal producer in the 19th century, according to historical
maps (Dannath and Nelle, 2009; Paysen, unpublished data). Thus
the charcoal spectra can be compared to the middle and upper

Combining data from palynology and anthracology not only
needs the use of archives which are close by, but also a sound
chronological comparability. Only if pollen and charcoal samples
are sufﬁciently dated, they can be compared. Thus, before we
discuss the palynological and anthracological data, we address the
chronological implications for the three examples, and this
approach to other studies which combine pollen and charcoal.
In the case of Kugelstattmoos, the pollen diagram is dated by
14
C-AMS-measurements of peat samples. Due to drainage, the
upper part of the peat shows a more decomposed layer where the
AMS-date falls into the Roman period. But the recorded human
impact in the diagram must be younger, since no settlement activites are known so early for this part of the montane forest, and also
because Secale dates the peat layer to medieval times. The charcoal
kiln sites are dated by comparing them to absolutely dated sites
according to their typology (see above). This might seem a bit weak,
but the strong increase in charcoal particles in the core during the
period of opening of the woodland and subsequent decrease can
only be explained by a contemporaneous charcoal production.
Though the absolute dating of the action e whether late medieval
or early modern times e remains vague, the synchronity of the

4.3. Kleiner Tornowsee
Pollen analysis was done on the ﬁrst 4 m of a 12 m long sediment sequence spanning the Late Glacial and Holocene. The
resulting simpliﬁed pollen diagram shows the vegetation development over the last 2000 years (Fig. 6). Zone A (416e270 cm) is
characterized by a low non-arboreal pollen proportion and values
of Betula, Alnus, Pinus (pine) and Quercus all around 20%. Fagus and
Carpinus reach more than 5 and around 10%, respectively, at their
highest. Alnus and Betula formed the vegetation around the lake,
and pine and oak trees were growing on the slopes. Zone B is
characterized by a strong increase of a range of indicators of human
impact, like cereal-types, Plantago lanceolata, Rumex type and
Artemisia. An increase in charred particles (microcharcoals) shows
local ﬁre activity. Quercus is decreasing slightly. The local vegetation
was opened, and cereal cultivation took place in the vicinity. An
increase in Humulus/Cannabis might indicate that hop cultivation
started during this time, possibly correlated with the lowering of
the lake water level in the 17th century AD. Afterwards (Zone C),
arboreal pollen reaches again high proportions, indicating the
regeneration of woodlands. Quercus shows a remarkable increase at
the beginning of zone C (216 cm). This might be due to ideal
ﬂowering conditions for Quercus, or due to the promotion of oak for
woodland pasture.
Overall 892 charcoal fragments from 36 samples (10 exposures)
were identiﬁed (Table 2). Quercus (n ¼ 688) and Pinus (n ¼ 185)
clearly dominate the spectra, and only very few pieces of Betula,
Corylus, Alnus, Acer and Salix were found. Fagus and Carpinus are
completely lacking in the analyzed material. According to AMS-14Cdating of several samples, the colluvial layers which contained the
charcoals formed especially during the early Holocene, the Bronze
Age/Iron Age and medieval times/modern times.

parts of the pollen diagram. They show the dominance of Fagus, but
also considerable amounts of Quercus, Alnus and Carpinus (Table 1).
According to the amount of species which need lighter conditions
in forests or grow in open land, like Betula, Salix (willow) and
Populus (poplar), the forest was more open and thus lighter than
today.

Fig. 6. Simpliﬁed pollen diagram of the upper part of core from Kleiner Tornowsee. Percentage values of selected pollen and spore types (black curves). White curves with depth
bars show 10-times exaggeration. Black dots: qualitative occurrence. Calculation base for arboreal pollen types is the sum of arboreal pollen, for the non-arboreal pollen the sum of
all upland plants.

LPAZ 9a and the charcoal kiln spectra is the only probable explanation. It could not have been earlier, because there are nearly no
charred particles in the proﬁle. And it could not have been later,
since then already Picea forest dominates the surrounding, which is
a clear contradiction to the Fagus (and Abies-) rich charcoal spectra.
In the case of Bargstedt, we compare a pollen diagram which
shows the woodland composition of the last 1500 years, with not
much change before the modern increase of pine and the modern
opening of the landscape. Since the charcoal production took place
before 1900 AD, we can compare the charcoal spectra to the part of
the diagram which gives us the woodland composition before the
landscape opening.
In the case of Kleiner Tornowsee, we discuss the information
about the composition of woody taxa derived from the pollen data
for the last 2000 years, and compare that to charcoal spectra from
colluvisols which date from Iron Age, medieval and modern times.
Both pollen diagram and charcoal samples are 14C-AMS-dated.
Other studies which used both pollen and wood charcoal
usually rely on the radiocarbon dating of archaeological charcoal
samples and adjoining pollen records. Leroyer and Heinz (1992)
did compare palynological and anthracological data from the
same Mesolithic and Neolithic archaeological levels from an abri
situation under a rock and Bronze Age to medieval levels of a cave.
This is ideal in terms of chronology, because each sample comes
from the same level. Speier (1994) used pollen proﬁles and charcoals from Iron Age and medieval smelting sites to reconstruct the
vegetation and land use history in the southeastern part of the
Rothaargebirge. He did not address the problem of synchrony of

samples in detail. A study by Hildebrandt et al. (2007) used charcoal spectra from kiln sites and two pollen proﬁles from small
mires which are close by. Charcoal burners operated their kilns
from the middle of the 18th century onwards, which is reﬂected in
the pollen diagrams by the decrease of Fagus and Quercus, the main
species for charcoal production according to the charcoal results.
Newman et al. (2007) use charcoal spectra from an Iron Age pit to
compare with the chronologically related part of a pollen diagram
from a bog ca. 2 km distant from the archaeological site. The pit is
dated with several radiocarbon samples, the pollen proﬁle with
one radiocarbon date and one tephra layer. Corylus is well represented in both records. Trees like Quercus and Fraxinus are more
strongly represented in the charcoal spectra, correspondence of
Alnus is good. Betula is absent from the charcoals, though present
in the pollen proﬁle. In summary, the cited studies do not address
the problem of synchrony of records speciﬁcally, they use them in
covariant comparison by relying on their absolute and relative
dating.
5.2. Kugelstattmoos
The palynological results alone would suggest an Abies-rich
beech forest vegetation in the montane region around the mire
during Iron Age times, which was then used and opened up by
medieval settlers. The charcoal spectra of the kiln sites show a more
differentiated picture. The charcoal burners used ﬁr trees which
grew predominantly around the mire on wetter sites, whereas at
the kiln sites around one km distant of the mire, around the top of

the mountain Hirschenstein, beech dominated the woodland and
was used for charcoal production. It seems improbable that the
differences in charcoal spectra e higher values of ﬁr at the sites
near the mire, nearly complete absence in the spectra in higher
elevations e are due to a wood selection. Minimum diameter data
of the charcoal fragments suggest that the used beech trees might
be affected at some sites by woodland pasturing during medieval
times (Nelle, 2002b), which might explain the scarce presence of ﬁr.
But ﬁr was present around the mire on groundwater close sites,
giving a local signal in the pollen record. With cutting down these
ﬁr trees for charcoal making, the pollen signal became more
regional, which is especially expressed by the increase of Pinus
pollen. Thus, with the pollen record alone it would have not been
possible to detect such ﬁne scale differences in woodland
composition.
5.3. Bargstedt
The region around the Bargstedter Moor was slightly opened up
by humans during Bronze Age, as indicated by a few anthropogenic
indicators in the pollen diagram (Ehlers, 2008). However, the area
had a high proportion of woodland through medieval to early
modern times, since arboreal pollen percentages are very high. The
proportions of the tree species which were found in the charcoal
production sites are strikingly similar in the pollen diagram and the
charcoal spectra. It seems that the charcoal can give a good
representation of the woodland composition, though generally
there might have been some selection of species for charring.
However, we found no indication for species selection, but for the
selection of certain diameters. Big stems were not charred in the
kilns around Bargstedt, but presumably used as construction wood,
whereas wood from coppiced stands, especially Carpinus, but also
Quercus, and branch wood from beech trees served as wood for
charcoal making.
5.4. Kleiner Tornowsee
In comparing the pollen and charcoal data, both records show
the dominance of pine and oak, clearly indicating the two dryresistant species as the main woodland constituents, especially on
south facing slopes with a higher insolation. However, from the
pollen data we would expect at least Carpinus as a local tree. Values
around 7 to more than 10% are usually interpreted as coming from
hornbeam trees nearby. In the case of Fagus, the pollen percentage
is ambiguous, with less than 5% interpreted as of regional source, or
of local occurrence. The complete lack of both species in the wood
charcoal record supports the hypothesis that these more nutrient
and especially moisture demanding tree species have not grown
along the slopes of Kleiner Tornowsee, at least not at the south
facing slopes.
The question remains how the charcoal came into the soil and
the colluvisols. Since there are no settlement sites known on the
slopes or on the tops of the lake catchment area, we presume that
anthropogenic ﬁres which burned the pine and oak trees produced
the charcoal. The available AMS-dates of charcoals are in good
accordance to times of more intense settlement activities in the
region (Dreibrodt et al., unpublished data).
6. Conclusions
The combination of pollen and charcoal data at Kugelstattmoos
provides more detailed insight in the vegetation composition on
a local scale. It revealed that high Abies amounts reﬂected in the
pollen diagram might be a local phenomenon, and woodland
stands around the top in this montane elevation are dominated by

Fagus. Human impact in the area is traceable via diameter analysis,
since some of the trees the charcoal burners used might have been
affected by woodland pasturing, which people commonly did
especially around relatively ﬂat mountain tops of central European
low mountain ranges since medieval times. However, the chronology of the records has to be improved by further radiocarbon
dating in the future.
Within the catchment of Kleiner Tornowsee charcoal and pollen
spectra show considerable differences during the last 2000 years.
Are these differences due to the different spatial resolution of both
archives? We hypothesize that with charcoal, we get a more precise
stand scale resolution than with pollen analysis; however, we need
more samples from the catchment area (and beyond) to solve the
new questions.
Thus, combining pollen analysis from lake and mire proﬁles
with charcoal analysis from archaeological contexts and soil-/
colluvial contexts enable us to reconstruct vegetation composition
and human impact in a more precise spatial resolution, or at least
rise questions which were formerly not put on the agenda.
