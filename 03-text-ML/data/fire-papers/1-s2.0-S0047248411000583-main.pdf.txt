A detailed taphonomic analysis is reported for a sample of the larger mammalian faunal assemblage
(>4.5 kg live body weight) from Blombos Cave. The analysis provides an assessment of human
involvement in the accumulation and modiﬁcation of the faunal assemblage, and precedes equally
detailed analyses and separate reports of Middle Stone Age (MSA) butchery, transport, and hunting
behaviour. At Blombos, there are clear differences in the relative abundances of ungulate body size
classes, with the lower MSA phases (upper/lower M2 and M3) showing a high representation of size 1
ungulates relative to the most recent MSA phase (M1). The bones from the earliest MSA phase (M3) have
not undergone much post-depositional fragmentation, in contrast to fragments from more recent phases
(M1 and upper M2). Much of this variability can be attributed to more burning activity and trampling
during M1 and upper M2, which could indicate more intensive occupation. Bone surfaces are variably
preserved, with high levels of exfoliation in the most recent two phases. Surface modiﬁcation analyses
revealed high proportions of human modiﬁcation throughout the sequence, indicating that MSA humans
were responsible for accumulating most of the larger mammals. After discard, the bones were modiﬁed
by scavenging carnivores, leading to a moderate amount of density-mediated destruction and toothmarking. Carnivores independently accumulated some of the smaller ungulates, mainly in the form of
partially-digested remains. Raptorial birds are not implicated as major faunal accumulators. The results
from Blombos are directly comparable with analogous datasets from two other sites in the Western Cape
(Pinnacle Point Cave 13B and Die Kelders Cave 1). Such comparisons demonstrate that MSA faunal
assemblages from nearby coastal sites have complex and different taphonomic histories both within and
between sites. Because the human occupants were a major part of these processes, MSA subsistence
behaviour and site use was also quite variable over time and space.

Introduction
The Middle Stone Age (MSA) in Africa started at or before ca.
250 ka and in some regions continued until 30 ka (Deacon and
Deacon, 1999; Stringer, 2002; McBrearty and Tryon, 2005; Tryon
and McBrearty, 2006). Blombos Cave (BBC e Western Cape) has
played an important role in studies of the emergence of modern
humans by yielding abundant evidence for behavioural complexity
for some periods within the MSA. This evidence includes marine

shell beads, large quantities of worked ochre, engraved ochre plaques, formal and informal bone tools, and ﬁnely-ﬂaked bifacial
stone tools typical of the Still Bay industry (Henshilwood and Sealy,
1997; d’Errico et al., 2001; Henshilwood et al., 2001a,b, 2002, 2004,
2009; Henshilwood, 2009; Villa et al., 2009). Until the systematic
excavation and analyses of the MSA layers at Blombos commenced
in 1992, (Henshilwood, 2008) such ﬁnds were rare in the MSA and
poorly-dated. New excavations at the South African site of Sibudu
(KwaZulu-Natal) have produced bone tools, shell beads, and
marked artefacts in association with Still Bay points (Cain, 2004;
Wadley, 2007; Backwell et al., 2008; d’Errico et al., 2008; Jacobs
et al., 2008). Also, a Still Bay component is present at Diepkloof
Rock Shelter on the Cape west coast (Rigaud et al., 2006), just below
younger MSA layers bearing engraved ostrich eggshell (Texier et al.,

2010). All of these sites contain worked ochre, as is the case for
many other MSA collections, but with a few exceptions (WeinsteinEvron and Ilani, 1994) systematic investigations on the signiﬁcance
and use of ochre commenced mostly in the past decade (Watts
et al., 1999; Barham, 2002; Henshilwood et al., 2002; Watts,
2002, 2009; Hovers et al., 2003; Mackay and Welz, 2008;
Henshilwood, 2009).
Finds of symbolic material culture from MSA contexts that may
have mediated human behaviour have contributed to an enhanced
understanding of the timing and tempo of the origins of modern
behavioural complexity. The topic has stimulated much debate
amongst archaeologists regarding when, where, and how the
modern behavioural suite arose (McBrearty and Brooks, 2000;
Henshilwood and Marean, 2003; Mellars, 2006; Klein, 2008;
Conard, 2010). Faunal exploitation strategies during the MSA and
Middle Palaeolithic have ﬁgured prominently in these discussions
(Stiner, 1993; Milo, 1998; Marean and Assefa, 1999; McBrearty and
Brooks, 2000). The focus has been on the ability to hunt large or
dangerous ungulates (Klein, 1976, 1989; Binford, 1984; Milo, 1998;
Marean et al., 2000; Clark and Plug, 2008; Faith, 2008), the ability
to make intensive use of seasonal resources (Klein et al., 1987), the
capacity to exploit ﬂying and swimming animals (Klein, 1975;
Henshilwood et al., 2001b), and the intensive use of marine
resources (Klein et al., 2004; Marean et al., 2007).
More recent work has begun to emphasize the variability found
within MSA subsistence behaviour, as evidenced by both faunal and
stone/bone tool assemblages (Wurz, 2002; Villa and Michel, 2006;
Lombard and Clark, 2008; Thompson, 2010b). These variations

provide important evidence for understanding early behavioural
complexity, and the mechanisms leading to its emergence.
However, such an understanding relies upon the availability of
a robust empirical record that includes a wide variety of
geographical and chronological samples. Until the last decade,
a lack of research focus on the MSA in general, limited preservation
of faunal remains at most MSA sites, poor excavation techniques,
and/or the discard of selected faunal materials from key sites has
kept the MSA faunal record from meeting these criteria. Research
based on the Blombos ﬁnds has played an important role in
changing this situation by illustrating that many behaviours
considered to be ‘modern’ were found in the MSA. This realisation
is one factor that has spurred new research into the MSA and has
resulted in the systematic recovery and analysis of large and wellpreserved faunal assemblages.
A variety of issues still make it difﬁcult to incorporate the
excavated sites that do preserve fauna into a larger picture of MSA
subsistence. For some important sites, such as Klasies River Mouth
(KRM e Eastern Cape) and Peers Cave (PC e Western Cape), the onsite collection of much of the faunal material was biased (Bartram
and Marean, 1999). At KRM, only the largest and/or most identiﬁable fragments were retained, and this likely explains the inconsistent interpretations of human subsistence at the site that are
presented in faunal reports (Klein, 1976; Binford, 1984; Milo, 1998).
At PC, almost all of the fauna was discarded onto the talus.
The MSA faunal assemblages from Diepkloof Rock shelter (DRS e
Western Cape) and Geelbek/Anyskop Dunes (GBA e Western Cape)
have not been published in detail (Parkington et al., 1987; Dietl

et al., 2005; Rigaud et al., 2006), while that from Ysterfontein 1 (YS1
e Western Cape) is currently too small to reveal meaningful
patterns of human behaviour (Halkett et al., 2003; Klein et al.,
2004). Border Cave (BC e KwaZulu-Natal) and Boomplaas (BPA e
Western Cape), both have published faunal assemblages but there is
no accompanying detailed taphonomic analysis that establishes the
portions of the assemblage that are relevant to questions of human
subsistence behaviour (Klein, 1977, 1978). Although taphonomic
analyses are available for the MSA assemblage from Sibudu (Cain,
2006; Clark, 2009), they are not integrated with the taxonomic/
body size data in a manner that makes them directly comparable to
published reports from other sites (Clark and Plug, 2008; Clark,
2009). For example, bone surface modiﬁcation data are reported
in general terms without being broken down by body size or bone
portion (e.g., long bone midshaft versus epiphysis). Because of this,
the Sibudu MSA assemblage cannot at present be directly compared
with either the Blombos data presented here or data from published
reports from the two other sites for which taphonomic analyses are
available: Die Kelders Cave (DK1 e Western Cape) and Pinnacle
Point Cave 13B (PP13B e Western Cape).
In this paper, we provide a taphonomic study of the MSA faunal
assemblage from Blombos using methods identical to those
employed at DK1 and PP13B (Marean et al., 2000; Thompson,
2010a). This allows for explicit comparisons across these three
assemblages, but until analogous data from other sites are presented in comparable format, only general comparisons can be
made to other important collections referred to here (Fig. 1). The
purpose of the present paper is to integrate taphonomic and
archaeological data in a way that will demonstrate the degree and
nature of human involvement in the accumulation and modiﬁcation of the faunal assemblage. This will provide an assessment of
human behaviour at the site and is a necessary prerequisite for
further interpretations of the Blombos fauna that will examine
human butchery, transport, and hunting. Detailed reports of cut
marks, percussion marks, and skeletal element representation will
be presented separately within these themes, along with raw data
that can be used to synthesise the Blombos data with those from
other sites (e.g., further details of MNE counts, skeletal element
abundances, cut and percussion mark data broken down by
element and element portion, etc.).

1999, about 13 m3 of the MSA deposit was excavated from Blombos
and excavations continue to the present (Henshilwood et al., 2001b,
2009; Henshilwood, 2008).

Stratigraphy and dating

Basic description

The MSA levels at the BBC site are divided into three phases,
comprised of a number of discrete layers (Fig. 2). These phases are
named M1, M2 and M3, and make up the analytical units used in
this study. The MSA layers comprising these phases have been
dated using a number of methods, including thermoluminescence
(TL), optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and electron spin
resonance (ESR) (Jones, 2001; Henshilwood et al., 2002; Jacobs
et al., 2003a,b, 2006; Tribolo, 2003; Tribolo et al., 2006). A hiatus
level composed of undisturbed aeolian sand above the M1 phase,
DUN (Fig. 2), is dated by OSL to ca. 70 ka (Henshilwood et al., 2002;
Jacobs et al., 2003a,b, 2006). A major episode of cave mouth closure
lasting ca. 68 ka is documented by this archaeologically sterile dune
sand layer that separates the ﬁnal MSA layers (ca. 72 ka) from the
earliest LSA layers with an age of ca. 2 ka (Henshilwood, 2008).
By using grains for which the OSL signals were individually
bleached and given two different laboratory doses, Jacobs et al.
(2003a, 2006:272) demonstrated that it is possible to detect the
mixing of grains with different values of De and to accurately
evaluate the doses given. Their results show that mixing would be
seen in single-grain measurements and that no mixing can be
seen for the sand in the DUN layer. Jacobs et al. (2006) concur that
this further strengthens the claim for the stratigraphic integrity of
the layer that separates the MSA and LSA at BBC (Henshilwood,
2006).
An OSL age of 72.7  3.1 ka was obtained for the upper part of
the M1 phase (Jacobs et al., 2006). The upper M2 phase is associated with the Still Bay techno-tradition and is dated at 74  5
and 78  6 ka by the TL method (Tribolo, 2006), and at
76.8  3.1 ka by OSL (Jacobs et al., 2006). These latter ages should
be regarded as the terminus post quem for the Still Bay levels at the
Blombos site. Based on the quantity of anthropogenically introduced deposits observed during excavations in the M1 phase, and
from later analysis, the layers CA, CB, CC, CCC, CD and CDA are
recorded as medium to high intensity deposits. Layer CDB in the
M1 phase contains a low intensity deposit, meaning that there is
some shell, bone, ash, etc., but in small quantities, and that these
deposits are not necessarily present over the whole layer and in all

Blombos Cave (BBC) is situated in a steep wave-cut cliff, 100 m
from the Indian Ocean and 34.5 m above modern sea level (34 250 S,
21130 E). Because of its elevation, there was no removal of sediments by high sea level stands during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS)
5e or MIS 1 as is the case at many lower-elevation coastal caves in
South Africa. Blombos Cave is set into the calciﬁed sediments of the
Tertiary Wankoe Formation (Henshilwood, 2008), and the calcareous environment is at least partially responsible for the good to
excellent state of the fossils that have been recovered
(Henshilwood et al., 2001b; Henshilwood, 2008).
When excavations at Blombos Cave commenced in 1992
(Henshilwood, 1995, 2008), the cave entrance was almost totally
sealed by dune sand. Approximately 20 cm of undisturbed aeolian
sand overlay the surface of the Later Stone Age (LSA) deposits,
indicating no disturbance of the cave’s contents since the ﬁnal LSA
occupation ca. 290 years ago. The earliest LSA occupation is ca. 2 ka.
It has a surface area of ca. 55 m2 with a long and low entrance about
10 m across, 7 m deep and 1e2 m in height while standing on MSA
deposits. The deposits partially extend into a recently-discovered
antechamber (d’Errico and Henshilwood, 2007). Between 1992 and

quadrates. In the upper M2 phase (Still Bay), the intensity of the
anthropogenic deposits in CFB/CFC and CFD are listed as medium
to high and CFA as a low intensity unit.
In the lower M2 phase layers, CGAA, CGAB, CGAB h1, CGAC are
listed as low intensity deposits. The lower M2 phase layers have an
OSL age of 84.6  5.8 ka (Jacobs et al., 2006). Only the upper level of
the M3 phase has been dated and produced an OSL age of
98.9  5.5 ka for the CH, CI and possibly CJ layers (Jacobs et al.,
2006). Layer CH is a low intensity deposit, and CI and CJ are high
intensity deposits. The ages of the lower layers within the M3 phase
are currently being determined.
Material culture: M1 and upper M2 phases
These phases at Blombos Cave contain high densities of bifacial
points, the fossil directeur of the Still Bay techno-tradition. Most are
made on ﬁne grained silcrete (Henshilwood et al., 2001b; Villa
et al., 2009). A strong argument for early behavioural modernity
in the MSA is the discovery of more than 65 shell beads in the M1
phase, 41 of which have been described (Henshilwood et al., 2004;
d’Errico et al., 2005). All of the beads are made from the shell of the
marine gastropod, Nassarius kraussianus, carefully pierced using
a bone tool then strung, perhaps on cord or sinew, and worn as
a personal ornament. More than 2000 pieces of ochre, many
bearing signs of utilisation and including eight deliberately
engraved pieces, have been recovered from the M1 and upper M2
phases (Henshilwood et al., 2001b; Watts, 2009). The engraved
pieces show that the designs result from deliberate intent and
arguably are among the most complex and clearly-formed of
objects claimed to be early abstract representations (Henshilwood
et al., 2002; d’Errico et al., 2003; Henshilwood, 2009; Texier et al.,
2010).
More than forty formal bone artefacts have been recovered from
the M1 and upper M2 phases, including awls and ‘points’
(Henshilwood and Sealy, 1997; Henshilwood et al., 2001a; d’Errico
and Henshilwood, 2007). The majority are awls made on long
bone shaft fragments, further manufactured by scraping and then
used to pierce soft material such as leather. At least some of the bone
tools that were carefully polished after being shaped by scraping are
probably projectile points made for hafting. It is noteworthy that the
points are treated differently from the awls. The high polish on these
points has no apparent functional reason that can be detected but
seems rather a technique that gives a distinctive appearance e an

“added value” e to these artefacts (d’Errico and Henshilwood,
2007).
Material culture: lower M2 phase
Bone tools, bifacial points and shell beads are absent from the
lower M2 phase. The intensity of the cultural deposits is low in this
phase but includes a few basin hearths, a very large hearth in layer
CGAC, small quantities of blades, ﬂakes and cores in silcrete, quartz
and quartzite, and some small pieces of ochre. A detailed analysis of
these artefacts is currently underway and the overall impression is
that human occupations in the M2 phase were of short duration
and possibly that the size of the groups was also limited.
Material culture: M3 phase
In this lower phase, lithics are frequent and exotic ﬁne grained
materials were commonly brought to the site for knapping. Retouch
on the M3 lithics is mostly informal, and a higher incidence of
ventral ﬂaking and denticulate or notched edges distinguish the
retouched lithics in M3 from those in the upper phases. Preliminary
ﬁndings indicate that the lithics in M3 do not conform to the typical
MSA I or MSA II patterns observed at the Klasies River site (Soressi,
pers. comm.).
Ochre is abundant in this phase and eight of these slabs are
deliberately engraved with either cross-hatched, Y-shaped or
crenulated designs (Henshilwood et al., 2001b, 2009; Watts, 2009).
This indicates a tradition for the production of geometric engraved
representation in the MSA at Blombos with roots that go back in
time to at least 100 ka, and which includes the production of
a number of different patterns. The ﬁndings support the view that
the use of ochre during the MSA at Blombos was not only functional
but that it also served, perhaps primarily, in a symbolic role
(Henshilwood, 2009). The chronological and material culture
associations of the phases at Blombos are summarised in Table 1.
General resource availability
Along the Southern Cape, coast fresh water springs are
numerous and emanate at the interface of the Table Mountain
Group sandstones and the upper tidal reaches. These perennial
springs are fed by deep inland aquifers in the Bredasdorp Group
and provide, apart from occasional rivers, one of the few

dependable sources of water on the coastal plain between the Cape
Folded Belt mountains and the Indian Ocean (Henshilwood, 2008).
Even during wet conditions, it is likely that these springs were
a major attractant for MSA people and for animals.
The faunal collection from Blombos is varied, which suggests
that MSA people may have practiced a subsistence strategy that
included a broad range of animals (Henshilwood et al., 2001b). This
must be conﬁrmed by taphonomic analyses of the small mammal
and tortoise components of the assemblage that are currently
underway. Shellﬁsh were collected and brought back to the cave
during all of the occupation phases, and the M3 phase is a particularly rich shell midden. The shellﬁsh species present in the MSA
levels are similar to those from the LSA. Fish bones have been
recovered in all phases and are under study. It has been argued that
prior to ca. 50 ka, MSA people were unable to exploit coastal
resources effectively (Klein et al., 2004) but this seems not to have
been the case at Blombos.
Palaeoclimatic context: Southern Cape and Blombos Cave
Overview
A bimodal or year-round rainfall system in the Quaternary
suggests that the southern Cape region was wetter than the more
western areas (Barrable et al., 2002), but was sensitive to changes in
the convergence of the Agulhas and Benguela currents from the
Indian and Atlantic Oceans, respectively. Upwellings on the adjacent shallow Agulhas plateau, sea level changes, and variability in
wind directions are likely to have inﬂuenced moisture supply to the
coastal areas of the southern Cape during the MSA (Bateman et al.,
2004). This would have also affected the species of ﬁsh and shellﬁsh
that are adapted to speciﬁc biomes. Climatic conditions during the
early and middle parts of MIS 5a (ca. 85e72 ka) (Butzer, 2004) in
southern Africa are likely to have been mild and warm with initially
wetter conditions before moving into the relatively cooler MIS 4
(van Andel, 1989; Chase, 2010). MIS 5a broadly correlates with the
M1 and upper M2 phase at Blombos, with the terminal Still Bay at
the top of M1 corresponding to the advent of MIS 4. The M3 phase
at Blombos corresponds with MIS 5c and marks a period of relatively warm conditions with sea levels possibly similar to those at
present.
There is a higher density of known MSA archaeological sites
with long sequences that date to MIS 5 in the Southern Cape (e.g.,
Klasies River, Boomplaas, Blombos Cave, Die Kelders, Pinnacle Point
13B, and Nelson Bay) compared with the few sites in the southwestern Cape (e.g., Peers Cave), which suggests that humans chose
the former area because it supported a higher biomass and offered
greater subsistence opportunities (Deacon and Lancaster, 1988;
Bateman et al., 2004; Butzer, 2004).

between local and regional scale environmental change, and the
impacts of this change on human behaviour as reﬂected in the
archaeological record.
A relatively low shellﬁsh density of 17.5 kg/m3 in the M1 phase
supports the contention of a retreating sea (Henshilwood et al.,
2001b). The ﬁnal stages of the M1 phase occupation fall within
the MIS 5/4a boundary and are dated to ca. 72 ka years ago.
Bateman et al. (2004) describes this as the start of the period
leading towards the Last Glacial Maximum with stadials of
increasing intensity and brief interstadials. In this terminal phase,
climatic conditions were likely also becoming colder and wetter
regionally with ﬂuctuating sea levels (Chase, 2010). From conditions that were relatively benign at ca. 76 ka years ago, it seems that
the colder, perhaps locally drier conditions and falling sea levels
would have impacted on the hunter gatherer ﬁshers that occupied
Blombos Cave in the terminal Still Bay. Deposition of the sterile
hiatus dune directly above the ﬁnal Still Bay, dated to ca. 70 ka,
further supports the model for dune accretion suggested by
Bateman et al. (2004) and provides important data on the deteriorating palaeoenvironment during the M1 ﬁnal phase of
occupation.
M2 phase (MIS 5b/a)
The early and middle parts of MIS 5b (ca. 95e85 ka) that
coincide with the lower M2 phase at Blombos are characterised
by interstadial conditions with rising sea levels after ca. 86 ka
years ago that persisted until ca. 74e70 ka years ago (Butzer,
2004). A transgression of sea levels from 60 m in MIS 5b
to 20 to 30 m in MIS 5a is reported globally (Lambeck et al.,
2002). Near the modern village of Still Bay, the presence of ca.
90 ka fossilized footprints of the elephant (Loxodonta africana)
indicate higher precipitation levels than at present with woodlands that may have extended close to this region during the
early stages of 5a (Roberts et al., 2008). The presence of the
common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia) in the upper M2 phase at
Blombos supports a bushy environment. The water-dependent
southern reedbuck (Redunca arundinum) provides a further indicator for relatively wet conditions during this M2 phase
(Henshilwood et al., 2001b).
Shellﬁsh data from the upper M2 phase support the contention
of a relatively higher sea level at this time. Shellﬁsh collecting at
Blombos was relatively intense in the upper M2 phase with 31.8 kg
of marine shells being recovered from each cubic metre excavated
(Henshilwood et al., 2001b). Low numbers of shellﬁsh are present
in some layers in the lower M2 phase. Easy access to shellﬁsh,
a sessile protein, and ﬁsh during MIS 5 b/a could have served to
draw hunter gatherer ﬁshers to the Southern Cape coast.
M3 phase (MIS 5c)

M1 phase (MIS 5a/4)
Cooler, perhaps drier conditions are indicated by an increase in
grazing animals at this time (Chase and Meadows, 2007). Grazers
such as black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) and/or hartebeest
(Alcelaphus buselaphus) are found in the M1 phase and suggest that
grassy conditions had replaced the bushier elements that typiﬁed
the vegetation during the M2 phase (Henshilwood et al., 2001b).
However, a recent palaeoclimatic synthesis by Chase (2010)
suggests that the conditions at this time may have actually been
more moist in southern Africa than has previously been inferred
from extra-regional records. This highlights the conclusions
reached by Chase (2010) and Jacobs et al. (2008) that detailed local
palaeoclimatic records paired with more reﬁned site chronologies
are still necessary to understand the complex relationships

This was a period of sea level ﬂuctuation in the southern Cape
(Carr et al., 2006) but between 109 and 98 ka, sea levels were
relatively high (Butzer, 2004) and possibly not less than 20 m below
present (Lambeck et al., 2002). The possibility of a more than 4 m
sea level during MIS 5c in the southern Cape is also reported
(Ramsay, 2002). Overall conditions were likely cool and dry but not
cold until after 100 ka (Shackleton et al., 1984; van Andel, 1989). The
high concentration of shellﬁsh in the Blombos upper M3 phase
(layers CH, CI), dated at ca. 100 ka, supports the proposition for
relatively higher sea levels and the shellﬁsh species present in these
layers are indicative of warmer sea surface temperatures
(Henshilwood et al., 2001b).
In summary, the excavated occupation horizons at Blombos

during MIS 6, and appear to be concentrated at times when
marine resources were readily available (Henshilwood et al.,
2001b; Jacobs et al., 2006; Henshilwood, 2008). The faunal
assemblage from Blombos provides an opportunity for a detailed
examination of human subsistence strategies during the relatively
warmer periods of MIS 5c/b leading into the more severe MIS 5a/4.
It also offers the chance to examine these strategies in tandem
with the substantial changes in technology and the material
expression of symbolism that have been documented at the site,
particularly between the oldest M3 phase and the overlying Still
Bay phases of M1 and upper M2.
Materials and methods
The faunal assemblage reported here consists of all of the larger
mammal postcranial fragments (>4.5 kg live weight) from the
2000, 2002, and 2004 excavation seasons that exceed 2 mm in the
maximum dimension. The sample includes all of the piece-plotted
specimens and specimens that have been recovered from the
screens, although unmodiﬁed faunal specimens were only
routinely piece-plotted in the 2002 and 2004 excavations. The
study does not include pieces of trabecular bone, bits of cortical
bone with no evidence of having a medullary cavity or having
otherwise come from a long bone, or fragments of cortical bone
with no facets, diagnostic shape, or muscle markings that could
indicate even an approximate location in the skeleton. The analysed
assemblage does include less identiﬁable fragments such as long
bone shaft fragments and long bone ﬂakes. All specimens meeting
the above criteria were cleaned with fresh water and given individual numbers for a total Number of Identiﬁed Specimens (NISP)
of 3879 from the M1 phase, 2047 from the upper M2 phase, 419
from the lower M2 phase, and 1256 from the M3 phase. These
include fragments not identiﬁable to speciﬁc body size.
All data collection was conducted at Iziko: South African
Museums of Cape Town. Each numbered specimen was entered as
an individual record into a customized Microsoft Access database.
Attributes such as element, side, taxon, and body size were entered
along with macroscopically visible taphonomic attributes such as
fragmentation (Villa and Mahieu, 1991) and burning (used here in
terms of present/absent and based on basic colour changes, such as
carbonization or calcination). Each specimen was then examined
under a 10e40 binocular zoom light microscope for more subtle
taphonomic indicators, such as weathering (Behrensmeyer, 1978),
rodent gnawing, and post-depositional surface destruction
(Thompson, 2005). Tooth, percussion, and cut marks were identiﬁed using the criteria established from modern experimental
collections (Blumenschine et al., 1996), and for which analyst
accuracy has been veriﬁed by blind tests on specimens modiﬁed by
known agents. These data were collected during the publication of
arguments regarding how to distinguish between carnivore tooth
marks, geochemical etching, and bioerosion (Dominguez-Rodrigo
and Barba, 2006, 2007; Blumenschine et al., 2007). Although
certain kinds of bioerosion can mimic tooth marks (particularly
root and fungus etchings), the Blombos assemblage only suffered
from one major morphological type of surface destruction (exfoliation). This, combined with the analyst’s experience in identifying
instances of bioerosion on fossil assemblages (Thompson, 2005),
and the fact that we only present high-conﬁdence marks of any
kind here, renders the chances of misidentiﬁcation on the Blombos
assemblage to be very low.
Each fragment that could be identiﬁed to element and conﬁdently placed on a template of that element was drawn into a GIS
image-analysis program developed by Marean et al. (2001), and
linked by specimen number to the external database. Where fragments could be identiﬁed to element and positioned on a template

751

but not sided (as was most often the case with metapodial fragments), specimens were drawn on alternate left and right side
templates (Thompson, 2008). The minimum number of elements
(MNE) was estimated from these GIS images on the principle of
overlaps: where two fragments overlap on a given element they
cannot be from the same element (Marean et al., 2001). This
provides a way to rapidly and effectively estimate MNE values from
any given subset of data without manually revisiting the collection,
but as with any method of estimating MNE values, it may miss an
overlap or indicate a very slight overlap (in terms of pixels) where
there is not one (Lyman, 2008). However, these errors are small and
unsystematic, and all of the images produced by the program were
manually inspected for areas where the MNE value may have been
inﬂated in this way. The smallest number of deﬁnite overlaps was
the one recorded as the MNE.
More details on skeletal element abundances by both NISP and
MNE will be presented separately, in a paper that deals speciﬁcally
with the issue of skeletal part transport. Here, all fragment counts
and bone counts are reported in terms of NISP and the MNE data are
used only for quantitative evaluation of density-mediated attrition.
This was done by examining bone portion representation relative to
ﬁve long bone zones: two epiphyses, two near-epiphysis shafts
(deﬁned as a length of shaft with any trabecular bone on the
interior), and one midshaft (Abe et al., 2002). The area represented
within each zone was calculated and multiplied by its MNE value,
then added to obtain the total area count (in pixels) within that
zone (Thompson, 2008; Thompson and Marean, 2009). The
proportion of the total area that fell within the ﬁve zones was then
expressed as a percentage and input as the y-axis into a regression
analysis with density as the x-axis.
Density values were taken from computed tomography (CT)
scans of a goat (Capra hircus) skeleton (Lam et al., 1998). When
dealing with an assemblage where nearly 98% of the fragments
identiﬁable to family or below are bovids (as at Blombos), and
where therefore the majority of generic ungulate fragments also
likely derive from bovids, the most accurate bovid values were
preferred. The sheep skeleton values are likely more accurate
because the density values were obtained by scanning the specimens in water rather than an alternate method used for wild
ungulates (Lam et al., 1999), where bones were scanned while dry
and then density values were calculated using a regression.
Spearman’s Rho was then applied to the bone mineral density
values versus bone portion representation as calculated by the
image-analysis program. This nonparametric test is less susceptible
to small sample sizes and inﬂuence by outlying points, and the fact
that the rank order of density values per scan site are tightly
correlated even across a wide variety of taxa further ensures that
the application of the sheep data to wild ungulates from Blombos is
not problematic (Lam et al., 1999; Carlson and Pickering, 2004).
Finally, because this test is based on rank ordering, inequalities in
the distribution of pixels across the different long bone zones will
have less inﬂuence on the resultant correlations.
Four other statistical tests were employed in this analysis. A Chisquared test was used to examine the likelihood of independence
between two nominal or ordinal variables (e.g., body size and
analytical unit). Fisher’s Exact Test was used on two-way tables of
data where small sample sizes made a chi-squared test inappropriate. This provided a way to assess if a given proportion of data in
one analytical unit was statistically different from the proportion of
data in another analytical unit. The 95% conﬁdence limits were
determined using Wald’s adjusted method (Agresti and Coull, 1998)
for proportional data for which large numbers of analytical units
required comparison (e.g., proportion of fracture angles that are
right or proportion of shaft fragments bearing a percussion mark).
Where these conﬁdence intervals overlapped, two proportions

752

J.C. Thompson, C.S. Henshilwood / Journal of Human Evolution 60 (2011) 746e767

were determined to be statistically indistinguishable with differences between the two possibly attributable to sampling error.
Finally, a KruskaleWallis test was used to assess if statistically
signiﬁcant differences existed between the medians of datasets
comprised of continuous data.

Basic taxonomic and body size representation by NISP for each analytical unit.
Counts are of fragments that could be identiﬁed maximally to each taxonomic level
(e.g., counts of ‘artiodactyl’ include fragments that could not be further identiﬁed as
bovid, suid, etc., rather than a total count of all artiodactyl specimens in the
assemblage).
Body size

Taxonomic and body size abundances
Basic description
The overall taxonomic composition of the Blombos Cave fauna
has been reported elsewhere for the material recovered during the
1992e1999 excavation seasons (Henshilwood et al., 2001b). In
terms of the relative proportions of large mammals, small
mammals (<4.5 kg live weight), and tortoises, the taxonomic
representation is similar to DK1 (Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 2000) and
YS1 (Halkett et al., 2003; Klein et al., 2004). The only other published MSA site for which taxonomic abundances of the complete
faunal assemblage is reported is PP13B, which has been shown to
have very high relative proportions of large mammals (Reed and
Rector, 2010; Thompson, 2010a). Although representation by NISP
has not been quantiﬁed for small mammals and tortoises at
Blombos, it is clear that the assemblage is more ‘typical’ in that
small fauna, such as hyraxes, hares, Cape dune mole rats, and
tortoises are very abundant. This will be explored quantitatively in
future studies, which will also include a return to the cranial
portion of the 2000, 2002, and 2004 large mammals and a taphonomic study of the remaining excavation seasons.
Because of the relatively small numbers of fragments that could
be reliably identiﬁed to species or even genus, and because of the
emphasis this study has on the taphonomic background of the
assemblage, all large mammal data are given here in terms of body
size and general taxonomic category at the family level or above
(Table 2). This is a standard way to present basic taxonomic data in
African zooarchaeology, where the diversity of ungulates, particularly bovids, makes it difﬁcult to identify species based on fragmented bone (Brain, 1981; Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1984). In terms of
both subsistence and taphonomy, body size plays an important role
in determining how carcasses will be processed, transported, and
affected by post-depositional processes. The emphasis on body size
abundances rather than taxonomic abundances therefore also
enables a much greater proportion of a given assemblage to be
employed in behavioural and taphonomic inferences. Some
examples of species from each body size class that were identiﬁed
from the same sample (Henshilwood et al., 2001b) include, but are
not limited to: grysbok/steenbok (Raphicerus spp., size 1),
springbok (Antidorcas spp., size 2), wildebeest/hartebeest (Connochaetes/Alcelaphus., size 3), eland (Taurotragus oryx, size 4), and
hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius, size 5).
One issue that should be addressed before comparing taxonomic or even body size abundances between phases is that of how
taphonomic processes impact an analyst’s ability to identify bone
fragments. The greater surface area of larger fragments gives them
the opportunity to retain more diagnostic morphology or preserve
anatomical landmarks, so that phases containing larger fragments
may be expected to produce more accurate taxonomic identiﬁcations. The median fragment length in M1 is 23 mm, compared with
lengths of 17, 15, and 17 mm for upper M2, lower M2, and M3,
respectively. A KruskaleWallis test for equality of medians shows
that there are signiﬁcant differences between the medians of
maximum fragment length between all phases combined
(H ¼ 328.5, p < 0.0001), but not between upper M2, lower M2, and
M3 (H ¼ 4.643, p ¼ 0.0981). This indicates that the most recent level
(M1) has larger fragment sizes and may therefore have more
fragments that are readily identiﬁable.

However, smaller animals would be expected to produce
smaller fragments. This is supported by signiﬁcant positive correlations between body size and maximum fragment length for M1
(Rs ¼ 0.5296, p < 0.001), upper M2 (Rs ¼ 0.4571, p < 0.001), lower
M2 (Rs ¼ 0.4238, p < 0.001), and M3 (Rs ¼ 0.4868, p < 0.001).
Because M1 has a larger proportion of fragments from animals with
body sizes of 3 and above (Fig. 3), the fragment size differences
between the phases are likely attributable to differences in body
size representation. This is important because a given fragment
from a small animal has more chance of retaining diagnostic
morphology than an analogous fragment of the same absolute size
from a larger animal. The actual percentage of a complete element
represented by a given fragment is therefore a major factor in
determining how identiﬁable the specimen is, with the other being
the presence of anatomical landmarks (Barba and DomínguezRodrigo, 2005; Pickering et al., 2006).
The image-analysis program records the shape and size of each
identiﬁed fragment on a template of a complete element, so that its

J.C. Thompson, C.S. Henshilwood / Journal of Human Evolution 60 (2011) 746e767

area relative to the whole can be calculated (Marean et al., 2001).
The proportional area of each fragment from a sample of elements
(humerus, radius, femur, and tibia) was calculated in this manner,
and very similar median proportional areas were found between
body sizes 1, 2, 3, and 4 (4.5%, 5.1%, 4.8%, and 4.5%, respectively). A
KruskaleWallis test did not ﬁnd these medians to be signiﬁcantly
different from one another (H ¼ 1.14, p ¼ 0.7687), demonstrating
that small and large ungulates experienced similar degrees of
overall fragmentation. There were greater differences between the
median proportional fragment sizes of bones from M1, upper M2,
lower M2, and M3 (5.3%, 3.4%, 3.8% and 5.0%, respectively). This
suggests that bones in the middle two phases experienced more
overall fragmentation, and this is conﬁrmed by a signiﬁcant
difference in medians (H ¼ 13.63, p ¼ 0.0035). However, from
a practical perspective a fragment that retains 3% of the original
element will not typically be more difﬁcult to identify than a fragment that retains 5%. It is therefore likely that taxonomic and
skeletal element identiﬁcations could be determined with
approximately equal degrees of conﬁdence throughout the
sequence and between body sizes.
Marine resources
Marine mammal representation at Blombos is relatively low, at
4.9% by the NISP of specimens that could be identiﬁed as either
terrestrial or marine. This is lower than the 10% reported by
Henshilwood et al. (2001b). The discrepancy between the two
results from Blombos is likely because Henshilwood et al. (2001b)
reported only specimens identiﬁable to element and did not
include long bone shaft fragments that are easily identiﬁed as being
terrestrial mammal owing to the presence of a medullary cavity.
Increased scrutiny of these less identiﬁable fragments therefore
likely resulted in a relative increase in terrestrial mammal
representation.
Despite the low overall proportions, differences in marine
mammal representation are apparent between phases at Blombos:
M1 has the highest proportion at 6.3%, upper M2 the lowest at
1.7%, and lower M2 and M3 similar with slightly higher proportions (4.9% and 4.8%, respectively). These are all close ﬁgures, and
it may be more useful to return to the larger set of published
taxonomic data available in Henshilwood et al. (2001b). These
mirror the results from the subsample reported here, keeping in
mind that no distinction is made between upper and lower M2 in
this dataset. In accordance with the methodological factors discussed above, the proportions are also higher: M1 has 12%, M2 has
5%, and M3 has 10%.

753

These proportions are not expected if environmental change
and proximity to the coastline was the primary determinate of
marine mammal representation at Blombos. M1, dated to a time
when the climate was shifting to one that was much cooler and
global sea levels much lower, should have the least evidence for
marine resource exploitation (Jacobs et al., 2006). In contrast, the
reported abundances of shellﬁsh recovered from Blombos do follow
the expected pattern. In terms of the kg shell/m3 of recovered
sediment, shellﬁsh are least abundant in M1 and become
progressively more so through upper M2 and M3 (Henshilwood
et al., 2001b). This indicates that even at the same time extensive
shellﬁsh exploitation was occurring in M3, the exploitation of other
marine resources such as seals was minimal and likely opportunistic. The marine mammal sample is overall quite small at Blombos, but the data may still suggest a shift in subsistence strategies
between upper M2 and M1. For example, the daily foraging radius
may have increased, more seals may have been scavenged as
climatic conditions deteriorated, or strategies to enhance opportunities for seal exploitation may have been developed.
Terrestrial mammal resources
There were no primate specimens identiﬁed in the Blombos
sample. Large terrestrial carnivore representation is also very low
(<1%). There were no hyenid remains recovered from the sample
reported here, and Henshilwood et al. (2001b) also report only
a single specimen. Small canids and felids, such as the black-backed
jackal (Canis mesomelas) and the African wild cat (Felis libyca),
instead comprise the larger carnivore representation in the sample.
These species are just barely larger than some of the mongooses
and other small carnivores that make up the majority of the
carnivores at Blombos but that are too small to be included in the
present study (Henshilwood et al., 2001b). The low carnivore
representation is an excellent indication that the site was not
extensively used by large denning carnivores such as hyenas, as den
sites often have high proportions of carnivore remains, many of
which are juveniles (Stiner, 1991). However, this does not rule out
the possibility that carnivores used the site transiently as
a temporary lair or as scavengers after human occupation.
Ungulate taxa dominate the identiﬁable assemblage at Blombos
(97.3% of specimens identiﬁable to the superorder or below). A full
49.9% of the larger mammal assemblage is represented by body size
1, and because of the dominance of ungulates it is most parsimonious to assume that most of these are ungulates (Fig. 3). Of the taxa
identiﬁable to the family level or below, 97.6% were positively
identiﬁed as bovids and because of this, it is very likely that other,
more general categories such as ‘artiodactyl’ and ‘ungulate’ are also
bovids (Table 2).
There are quite dramatic differences in body size representation
between major stratigraphic units at Blombos. There is a nearly
even distribution between size 1, 2, and 3 mammals (most of which
are likely ungulates) in M1, while upper M2, lower M2, and M3
have an abundance of size 1 (64.9%, 72.6%, and 58.0%, respectively).
The distributions of body sizes are shown to be independent from
the phases from which they are derived when a Chi-squared test
was used to examine each phase side-by-side with another phase
(Table 3).
Particular attention is given to the relative abundances of size 1
mammals for three reasons. First, this size class has been shown at
other MSA sites to be the most likely candidates for non-human
accumulation. For example, in Layer 11 of DK1, small ungulates are
the most abundant size class but were found to have been
predominately collected by raptors (Marean et al., 2000). At PP13B,
there was also an elevated non-human (in this case, carnivore)
input for this size class (Thompson, 2010a). Second, if size 1

ungulates at Blombos are found to be primarily accumulated by
humans, then this has the potential to inform about changes in
hunting technology. Clark and Plug (2008) suggested that size 1
ungulate representation at Sibudu might be attributable to specialised hunting techniques, such as net-hunting. A detailed taphonomic analysis has not been published for each individual body size
at Sibudu, but certainly if the accumulator was MSA humans, then
small, pair-bonded antelope that use elusive hiding as their
primary predator-defence system require different acquisition
strategies than do large, herding ungulates that use speed to escape
(Skinner and Chimimba, 2005).
Finally, differences in the proportions of size 1 mammals at
Blombos through time may provide subtle signals of climate
change. Different species of African bovids have habitat preferences
that can be used to reconstruct past environments. However, these
analyses require faunal assemblages with large numbers of specimens identiﬁable at least to the tribe and often to the genus or even
species level. This is further problematic at archaeological sites,
where assemblages are often highly fragmented and human
transport decisions may have biased the representation of cranial
and dental elements (those elements that are most readily identiﬁed to the requisite level of speciﬁcity). Most of the size 1 ungulates
at Blombos are grysbok/steenbok (Raphicerus spp.), and all are
typical inhabitants of relatively closed-habitat (particularly fynbos)
environments in the modern day (Henshilwood et al., 2001b;
Skinner and Chimimba, 2005). The body size data based on postcranial NISP therefore also provide a proxy way to measure changes
in the abundances of closed-habitat bovids with fewer of the
problems that arise when more speciﬁc taxonomic identiﬁcations
are required. Following on this, a reduction in size 1 representation
at Blombos could signal periods of less fynbos in the area immediately around the site, as has been suggested here to be the case
during M1 times based on other lines of evidence.
In light of the potential importance of size 1 ungulates, it is
notable that the most extreme differences in body size abundances
at Blombos lie with size 1 mammals (most of which are likely
ungulates). Fisher’s Exact Test shows that the proportions of size 1
relative to all other size classes are statistically different between all
phases (p ¼ 0.0080 between upper and lower M2; p < 0.0001 for
the same comparisons between all other phases). The most parsimonious explanation for this pattern is that it was driven by
changes in local climatic conditions. Upper/lower M2 and M3
represent occupations during relatively warm intervals. Terminal
M1 represents a shift to a colder and more arid period during MIS 4.
This may have resulted in more open vegetation and a subsequent
reduction in the available habitat for small browsers, which is in
agreement with the climatic data summarised above. However,
prey selection and transport will vary with the major predator
responsible for the accumulation and faunal representation may
not be a random sample of the surrounding environment. The
remainder of this paper therefore focuses on determining which
predator this was during each time period and for different
mammalian body size classes.

Agent of accumulation
Background
Reliable interpretations of past human subsistence behaviour
rely on analyses that use only components of a given assemblage
that were actually collected and/or modiﬁed by the people in
question. Cave assemblages are particularly suspected as having
had multiple accumulators because caves act as focal points on the
landscape to which carnivores, raptors, rodents, humans, and
abiotic processes (such as running water) all bring bones that will
eventually become fossils (Brain, 1981; Lyman, 1994). Large
mammal zooarchaeology beneﬁts from a variety of actualistic and
naturalistic studies that bridge the interpretive gap between the
behaviour of various bone modiﬁers and the physical effects they
have on a bone accumulation. These analyses include the sizes and
types of elements that are present (Marean and Spencer, 1991;
Marean et al., 1992; Pickering et al., 2003), and the microscopic
traces that are left on bone surfaces (Blumenschine, 1986, 1995;
Blumenschine and Selvaggio, 1988; Capaldo and Blumenschine,
1994; Selvaggio, 1994; Blumenschine et al., 1996; DominguezRodrigo, 1997, 2003a, 2008; Capaldo, 1998a; Selvaggio and
Wilder, 2001; Pickering et al., 2004; Dominguez-Rodrigo and
Yravedra, 2009).
Along with the presentation of taxonomic data, Henshilwood
et al. (2001b) provided macroscopic taphonomic data. Based on
these preliminary results, the authors concluded that most of the
large mammals were accumulated by humans but they recommended that a thorough taphonomic study that employs microscopic techniques also be employed (Henshilwood et al.,
2001b:435). This is provided here, and indeed shows a greater
complexity in the interpretation of site formation processes at
Blombos. However, the results of this microscopic analysis can only
follow primary assessments of the degree to which other taphonomic processes may have introduced systematic biases into the
assemblage. Such biases can make it more difﬁcult to tease out the
accumulative agent(s), as discussed in Thompson (2008). These
include selective destruction of elements and element portions,
such as long bone epiphyses (Marean and Frey, 1997; Bartram and
Marean, 1999; Marean et al., 2004). Such portions retain more
diagnostic morphology and are often the most readily identiﬁable
but are less dense and may be preferentially destroyed by a variety
of taphonomic processes (Lyman, 1993; Lam et al., 2003). Because
of the impact that any form of differential destruction has on the
interpretations of human behaviour and involvement in a fossil
assemblage, an examination of the degree to which this might have
occurred at Blombos is a ﬁrst-order priority.
Differential destruction
Because some skeletal elements are less dense than others,
skeletal element representation at a site can provide an initial
indication of whether or not density-mediated attrition may have
been a component of the overall taphonomic system (Lyman, 1985).
Table 4 provides an overview of skeletal representation at Blombos
for the major elements by NISP and MNE. Fig. 4 shows both intraelement and inter-element differences in representation. Representative images of bone fragments mapped onto a template of
each element illustrate how individual fragments are distributed
and overlap most frequently on the densest and/or most easilyidentiﬁed portions (Marean et al., 2001).
Fig. 4 also charts the MAU (Minimum Animal Units) next to
maximum bone mineral density data for scan sites on a blue
wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) skeleton from Lam et al. (1999).

paired elements (such as long bones), the MAU provides a way to
examine their representation in light of their actual occurrence in
a complete skeleton (Lyman, 2008). The bone density data have
been selected from Lam et al. (1999) because the sheep data from
Lam et al. (1998) do not include values for non-long bones. Both the
MAU and bone density were standardised to the highest value in
the dataset in order to facilitate the visual comparisons.
At Blombos, inter-element representation between axial and
appendicular elements follows the same general pattern as bone
mineral density. This can be a common result of density-mediated
attrition (Bartram and Marean, 1999; Marean and Cleghorn, 2003;
Cleghorn et al., 2004) and suggests that the two are correlated.
However, when all of the elements are compared against maximum
bone mineral density, Spearman’s rho shows only a weak and
insigniﬁcant correlation within both standardised (Rs ¼ 0.2554,
p ¼ 0.3330) and unstandardised values (Rs ¼ 0.3400, p ¼ 0.3240).
This is a classic problem of equiﬁnality in faunal assemblages
because the least dense bones also tend to have the highest caloric
returns (Marean and Cleghorn, 2003), and inter-element representation may also therefore be shaped by hominin (or carnivore)
transport behaviour (Stiner, 1991; Bar-Oz et al., 2004; Cleghorn and
Marean, 2004). For example, there can be a great deal of variability
in how modern hunter-gatherers transport heads from carcasses of
different body sizes, and the axis and atlas vertebrae often travel
where the head goes (Monahan, 1998). Because of the particularly
dense dens portion of the axis, this element will be assigned the
highest ranking in Spearman’s correlation even though its predepositional representation at a site may be very low because of
transport decisions having to do with the number of carriers,

distance from kill site, and other archaeologically unknowable
factors.
An examination of intra-element representation provides a way
to evaluate the effects of density-mediated attrition independently
of potential inter-element transport bias. Fig. 4 shows that within
the long bones, Blombos is a shaft-dominated assemblage. This is
conﬁrmed by the NISP data, where a full 67% of long bone fragments (including both generic fragments and those identiﬁable to
speciﬁc element) are shaft fragments, with 20% near-epiphysis
shaft fragments and a mere 13% represented by epiphyseal
portions. When ungulate long bone portion representation is
plotted against bone portion density for the entire sample (with no
subdivisions by archaeological phase), Spearman’s Rho conﬁrms
a highly signiﬁcant positive correlation between the two variables
(Rs ¼ 0.4879, p ¼ 0.0062). This indicates that a substantial
proportion of density-mediated destruction has occurred and long
bone epiphyses are preserved in proportions that are farther
removed from their original representation than denser portions
such as long bone shafts (Cleghorn et al., 2004; Marean et al., 2004;
Thompson and Marean, 2009).
When the data were broken down stratigraphically ( ¼ chronologically) and by body size, Spearman’s Rho shows a positive and
highly signiﬁcant correlation between bone density and bone portion
representation below the a ¼ 0.05 level for all but two data subsets
(Table 5). Fig. 5 visually shows this pattern for all analytical units and
body sizes combined at Blombos, and for each MSA phase for which
there is a signiﬁcant correlation. The sample sizes from lower M2 and
M3 are extremely small. This is evidenced by the wide spread
of datapoints, which also indicates that the correlations should be

interpreted cautiously. Within the large samples from M1 and upper
M2, the residuals for epiphyses almost always fall on or below the
linear regression line. This indicates that these less dense portions are
actually less well-represented than predicted by their density. In
contrast, the residuals for near-epiphysis shafts are nearly always
positive. The graphs also illustrate that both bone density and an
analyst's ability to identify bone fragments likely impact how bone
portion representation is reported from an assemblage. This is
particularly the case for highly fragmented assemblages derived from
animals of a larger body size. Near-epiphysis shafts may be overrepresented because they possess both a dense midshaft portion that

is likely to survive, as well as a less dense but generally more easilyidentiﬁed near-epiphysis portion (Thompson and Marean, 2009).
All correlations at Blombos are lower than were observed for
large ungulates at other sites, such as PP13B and DK1 (note that
values for Blombos given here differ slightly from Thompson and
Marean [2009] because the current regressions were run after
rounding both input values to two decimal places). However, there
is sufﬁcient evidence of selective depletion of less dense portions to
warrant careful consideration of which fragment types should be
included in analyses used to determine the accumulator. This is
because experimental and ethnoarchaeological studies have shown
that carnivore ravaging of a bone assemblage results in such
a pattern of density-mediated destruction, and that ravaging is an
extremely common process even at sites where humans have
nearly depleted all of the nutrients from bones through marrow
and/or grease extraction (Marean and Spencer, 1991; Marean et al.,
1992; Bartram, 1993; Lyman, 1993, 1994; Lupo, 1995; Lam et al.,
1998, 2003; Bartram and Marean, 1999; Pickering et al., 2003;
Cleghorn et al., 2004; Thompson and Lee-Gorishti, 2007).
The density-mediated destruction documented at Blombos
shows some suggestive patterns that should be explored in more
detail. In particular, the small ungulates at Blombos appear to have
undergone less density-mediated attrition than have large ungulates e although they are nearly equal in the M1 phase. This is
important because it could indicate differences in the accumulator
or the proportion of contribution from different accumulators.
Raptors, large carnivores, small carnivores, carnivores with
different bone-crunching apparatus (e.g., canids versus felids), and
humans will destroy less dense portions of bone to varying degrees.
This is also the case for humans using grease extraction methods

versus humans who do not comminute bone to extract bone grease
(Church and Lyman, 2003). These results reinforce the importance
of a thorough taphonomic analysis aimed at untangling the agent
(s) of accumulation. They also show that only the densest archaeological fragments e long bone midshafts e should be used to
explore this through analyses of bone surface modiﬁcation
(Blumenschine, 1986, 1988, 1995; Capaldo and Blumenschine, 1994;
Selvaggio, 1994; Blumenschine et al., 1996; Dominguez-Rodrigo,
1997, 2003a, 2008; Capaldo, 1998a; Selvaggio and Wilder, 2001;
Marean et al., 2004; Pickering et al., 2004; Dominguez-Rodrigo
et al., 2007a; Dominguez-Rodrigo and Yravedra, 2009).
Preservation and post-depositional fragmentation
Because proportions of surface modiﬁcation on archaeological
bones will be lowered by a high degree of weathering, surface
destruction, or post-depositional fragmentation (i.e., when the bone
was in a non-nutritive state), the second stage of analysis must
assess and correct for these factors (Abe et al., 2002; Thompson,
2005). One way to assess the relative degrees of post-depositional
fragmentation between analytical units is by analysis of the
completeness of compact bones (Marean, 1991). These are rarely
fragmented by humans or carnivores while the bone is in a nutritive
state, and if so they commonly bear a percussion mark, tooth mark,
or gastric etching as evidence. Compact bones bearing such modiﬁcations can then be excluded from analysis, ensuring that fragmentation can be most reliably attributed to post-depositional
processes such as sediment compaction or leaching (Marean, 1991).
The calcaneum was also excluded because its small marrow
cavity invites differential fragmentation relative to the other bones
of the wrist and ankle. Sesamoids and the patella were not used in
order to create a dataset that is comparable with that presented for
other MSA sites and published sites in east Africa on which the
method was developed (Marean, 1991; Thompson, 2010a). At
Blombos, the sample of unmodiﬁed ungulate compact bones that ﬁt
these criteria was relatively small, but sufﬁcient to be used as one
line of evidence (n ¼ 80 in total, including the very small sample of
seven from lower M2). By following the procedures outlined by
Marean (1991), completeness indices were derived for unmodiﬁed
carpals and tarsals from different analytical subsets. Overall, at
Blombos compact bones from small (size 1 and 2) ungulates had
a higher average completeness index (92%) than did compact bones
from large (size 3, 4, and 5) ungulates (68%).
Post-depositional fragmentation seems to have been more
severe in more recent deposits, as shown by increasing completeness from top to bottom of the stratigraphy (M1 ¼ 78%, upper
M2 ¼ 81%, and M3 ¼ 97%). This pattern may be exaggerated by the

relatively higher numbers of large ungulates in M1 relative to M3,
but sample sizes were too small for the effects of body size to be
further examined for M1, upper M2, and M3 separately (n ¼ 28, 30,
and 15, respectively). However, if differential post-depositional
fragmentation of large ungulate compact bones was driving the
pattern, the completeness indices from upper M2 and M3 should be
more similar to one another, rather than upper M2 being more
similar to M1. This provides an initial indication that post-depositional fragmentation cannot be explained by a simple model of
sediment compaction acting over long periods of time.
Another measure of post-depositional fragmentation is long
bone fracture patterns; shafts that were broken while fresh tend to
retain oblique fracture angles and curved or V-shaped fracture
outlines, while shafts broken while in a ‘dry’ state tend to have right
fracture angles and transverse fracture outlines (Villa and Mahieu,
1991). The Blombos sample had 5082 long bone fragments (of
which 3577 could only be identiﬁed as generic long bone fragments
or long bone ﬂakes), resulting in a potential 10 164 long bone
fractures that could be used for analysis. Of these, only 5856
remained after elimination of unbroken ends, indeterminate ends,
ends from fragments that could not be assigned to a body size, or
fractures that suffered excavation damage and thus are uninformative about ancient breakage patterns. Most archaeological and
experimental datasets report fragmentation data only for specimens at least 2 cm in maximum dimension. When only specimens
of 2 cm or greater in maximum dimension are considered, this
number is further reduced to 2969 (Table 6). Larger mammal
specimens smaller than this can still often be assigned to body size
class where the size difference is great (e.g., between size 1 and 3
specimens), but adjacent body size classes (such as 1 and 2 or 2 and
3) may not be as reliably discerned from one another. Also, fracture
angles can be difﬁcult to describe because fracture planes can
merge together on smaller fragments as the shape of fragments
becomes less markedly elongate and cease to have two clear ‘ends’
(Pickering et al., 2005). This shape change with increased fragmentation is documented at Blombos, where length:breadth ratios
for the 5082 long bone fragments increase positively and signiﬁcantly as maximum fragment sizes increase (Spearman’s
Rs ¼ 0.4617, p < 0.001). Therefore, the more conservative approach
of only considering fragments of 2 cm or greater in maximum
dimension for the analysis of fracture angles and outlines (Villa and
Mahieu, 1991) is preferred here.
At Blombos, there is no directional trend in the proportions of
‘green’ and ‘dry’ breaks by body size and only small samples of size
5 animals are available for some analytical units (Table 6). The angle
and outline data also track one another closely within all data
subsets. These factors justify dividing the fragmentation data into

groupings of size 1/2 and size 3/4 for analytical purposes, and using
proportions of right-angled breaks as an overall proxy for the
degree of post-depositional long bone fragmentation (Fig. 6). With
the exception of the very small sample from lower M2, large (size 3/
4) ungulates consistently have lower proportions of right-angled
breaks than do small (size 1/2) ungulates from the same analytical
unit. Although the 95% conﬁdence intervals all overlap, this
consistency in the data may suggest that larger ungulates underwent slightly less post-depositional breakage than did smaller
ungulates. This is not a consistent pattern across all sites of similar
age. Layer 11 at DK1 shows the opposite pattern (Fig. 6), and
Yeshurun et al. (2007) found that at Levantine Palaeolithic sites,
larger ungulates seem to have been subjected to a greater degree of
abiotic post-depositional fragmentation.
Furthermore, the compact bone and long bone data do not show
the same pattern for large versus small ungulates. This suggests
that these two element types are differentially susceptible to postdepositional fragmentation at least partially in accordance with
body size. However, at Blombos all fragmentation data clearly
demonstrate that the oldest deposits (M3) were subjected to the
least amount of post-depositional fragmentation. Because simple
sediment compaction over time cannot be invoked to explain this
phenomenon, it suggests that cave roof-fall, increased trampling, or
some other agent had a greater impact in more recent deposits. One
of these processes could be increased sub-aerial weathering and/or
burning, which can weaken the bone and lead to greater susceptibility to breakage by other means (Marean et al., 2000).
At Blombos, only one fragment was weathered beyond
Behrensmeyer’s (1978) stage 1, and thus weathering cannot account
for differences in post-depositional fragmentation. However, 27.4% of
the assemblage shows some evidence of colouration changes owing
to having been burned. The lowest proportion of burned fragments
occurs in M3 at the base of the sequence (15.2%). This increases in
lower M2 (22.4%), the highest proportion occurs in upper M2 (35.9%),
and there is an intermediate proportion at the top in M1 (27.4%).
Eliminating burned long bone fragments results in a decrease in the
relative proportions of ‘dry’ breaks and a corresponding increase in
the proportions of ‘green’ breaks for all phases (Fig. 6). However,
when only unburned fragments are considered, the M3 fragments
still appear to have been subjected to less post-depositional fragmentation and the upper end of the M3 conﬁdence intervals still only
barely overlap with the lower ends of the M1 and M2 conﬁdence
intervals. This suggests that increased burning in M1 and upper M2 is
not the primary cause of additional post-depositional breakage in
younger sediments at Blombos. Other potential causes may be
increased intensity of occupation and/or trampling and surface
activity per unit of time.

Importantly, all archaeological data exhibit a degree of postdepositional fragmentation that exceeds the 95% conﬁdence limits
reported for three modern known-agent experimental assemblages (Marean et al., 2000). This indicates that the proportions of
surface modiﬁcation, such as cut, percussion, and tooth marks
have been depressed from their original values at the time of
discard. Fragments exhibiting evidence of post-depositional
breakage should therefore be eliminated from long bone surface
modiﬁcation analyses (Abe et al., 2002). This is the most conservative approach, and it will make the Blombos data comparable
with those reported from other MSA sites in the Western Cape,
such as PP13B (Thompson, 2010b) and DK1 (Marean et al., 2000).
It is also necessary to eliminate fragments with poorlypreserved surfaces. Overall, less than 1% of the assemblage
shows extensive dendritic etching, pocking, sheen, or smoothing
(Thompson, 2005). These types of post-depositional surface
modiﬁcation were spread evenly throughout the three major
phases, suggesting that the factors that created these modiﬁcations
were basically the same over time. In the case of dendritic etching,
root activity was almost certainly the culprit, as evidenced by the
preservation of small clusters of tubular plant cells that occasionally still follow these etchings. These clusters may represent
modern rootlet invasion or they may be the calcined ash remnant of
a plant that etched the surface of the bone long ago and was
subsequently burned (Karkanas et al., 2007).
Exfoliation at Blombos was by far the most common form of
bone surface destruction, and occurred on 14.7% of specimens
(Thompson, 2005). Fragments with severely exfoliated surfaces or
with more than 70% of their surface covered in matrix are therefore
not included in the surface modiﬁcation analysis. Unlike the other
types of surface destruction, exfoliation was not evenly distributed
throughout the phases, but instead is highest at the top in M1
(31.2% of bones affected to some degree), similar in upper M2 and
M3 (both 11.5%), and intermediate in lower M2 (16.2%). The agent
behind such exfoliation is unknown, but it appears to proceed via
the crystallization of minerals in miniscule ﬁssures in the bone
surfaces such that layers of bone peel away. Ironically, fossils from
the oldest sediments (M3) are the best-preserved in all senses of
the word. In contrast, the fauna from M1 has suffered the most
density-mediated destruction, one of the highest degrees of postdepositional fragmentation, and the most destruction of bone
surfaces through exfoliation.
Surface modiﬁcation
Gastric etching and rodent gnawing are rare at Blombos at 4.0%
and <0.6% for all phases and body sizes, respectively. The

760

proportions of gastric etching differ among phases: 2.3% in M1, 3.8%
in upper M2, 9.8% in lower M2, and 7.4% in M3. Furthermore, they
differ a great deal among body sizes, with the highest proportions
always occurring on size 1 specimens where body size could be
determined and sample sizes were greater than N ¼ 4 (Table 7).
Overall proportions of gastric etching among body sizes 2, 3, and 4,
are not signiﬁcantly different below even the a ¼ 0.10 level using
Fisher’s Exact Test. However, proportions of gastrically-etched size
1 fragments are signiﬁcantly higher than all other body sizes
(p < 0.0001 for all tests). This indicates that size 1 ungulates at
Blombos were accumulated more commonly by a different agent
than ungulates of other body size classes. Because both mammalian
and avian predators can leave gastric etching (Andrews, 1990),
several additional lines of evidence should be examined to determine what this agent was.
Raptor involvement in the accumulation of small mammals,
including small bovids, has been documented at other coastal MSA
sites in the Western Cape. At DK1, the distribution of gastricallyetched fragments under solution cavities showed that size 1
ungulates were collected in part by roosting raptorial birds (Marean
et al., 2000). In contrast, at Blombos the gastrically-etched fragments are distributed evenly throughout the cave and well inside
the dripline beyond appropriate roosting areas for raptors (Fig. 7).

The distribution of this etching across the skeletal elements of size
1 ungulates is in general agreement with this. Raptors typically are
not able to digest elements much larger than the small bones of the
distal limbs such as carpals, tarsals, and phalanges (Andrews, 1990),
yet at Blombos between 46 and 61% of all gastrically-etched
elements are on axial elements or long bones. Experimental studies
and examination of ingested small mammal remains from
archaeological contexts suggest that human digestive processes
result in bone fragments with etching similar to other mammalian
carnivores (Crandall and Stahl, 1995; Dewar and Jerardino, 2007).
Such a study has not been conducted for the digestion of larger
mammals by humans, but chimpanzee scats show that size 1
animals can be gastrically-etched by hominoids (Tappen and
Wrangham, 2000). However, this study also found that the mean
fragment size was 11.8 mm for chimpanzees (s.d. 6.9) while the
mean gastrically-etched fragment size at Blombos was larger (15.2
in M1, s.d. 7.9; 13.2 in upper M2, s.d. 6.1; 16.3 in lower M2, s.d. 8.9;
13.9 in M3, s.d. 7.3).
Mammalian carnivores (especially canids and hyenids) swallow
larger pieces of bone to extract any remaining grease in the gut
(Estes, 1991; Marean et al., 1992; Skinner and Chimimba, 2005). The
extent of etching on the bones, the distribution of etched fragments, and the size of etched fragments indicate that such carnivores are the most likely agents responsible for this type of
modiﬁcation at Blombos. Because the proportion of etched bones is
signiﬁcantly higher for size 1 ungulates, this in turn indicates that
the abundance of size 1 ungulates at Blombos cannot be attributed
solely to human prey choices. Importantly, the distribution of this
etching differs between major phases, with particularly high
proportions of gastrically-etched size 1 and size 2 fauna in lower
M2 and M3 (Table 7). The taxonomic data did not indicate that
carnivores were using the site for extended periods of denning, but
other indicators of anthropogenic activity suggest that the lower
phases were less intensively occupied than more recent phases.
Therefore, the gastrically-etched bone was likely introduced from
excreted or regurgitated carnivore food remains, consumed away
from Blombos and brought to the site when humans were not
present. In order to ascertain the accumulator of the bones brought
to Blombos for consumption on site by either humans or carnivores,
surface modiﬁcation inﬂicted on the bone when it was in a fresh
state must be examined in detail.
A series of actualistic studies has shown that long bone midshafts survive better than other elements or element portions
through hominin processing and carnivore ravaging, and that they
preserve evidence of the sequence of these activities on their

proportions of cut-marked bone to directly address the accumulator of an assemblage. This is because the frequencies with which
cut marks are produced can vary dramatically depending on factors
such as butcher skill, amount of ﬂesh remaining on the bone,
butchering strategy, taxon, body size, and the material that
comprises the cutting tool (Dominguez-Rodrigo, 1997, 2003b,
2008; Nilssen, 2000; O’Connell et al., 2003; O’Connell and Lupo,
2003; Dominguez-Rodrigo and Yravedra, 2009).
Tooth marks can also be problematic because they are less
activity-speciﬁc and can be left during both within-bone and
outside-bone nutrient extractions. Based on morphology alone,
a single mark cannot be diagnosed as being left by a felid, canid,
hyenid, or other carnivore (Dominguez-Rodrigo and Piqueras,
2003), although modiﬁcation by multiple carnivore taxa can be
inferred from the shapes and sizes of the marks (Selvaggio and
Wilder, 2001). Even suids, humans, and crocodiles leave tooth
marks that cannot always be differentiated from other bone
modiﬁers (Njau and Blumenschine, 2006; Landt, 2007;
Domínguez-Solera and Domínguez-Rodrigo, 2008). This is important because proportions of tooth-marked midshafts can deviate
from experimental models of carcass access if the numbers and
species of carnivores accessing a carcass vary. For example, felids
leave substantially fewer tooth marks when they have primary
access and some carnivores leave extensive tooth-marking even
when scavenging the remains of human kills (Dominguez-Rodrigo
et al., 2007a,b). Given these variables, the relative proportions of
tooth-marked and percussion-marked midshafts in an assemblage
have been shown to be more informative than the absolute
proportion regarding the sequence of carcass access for carnivores
and humans (Blumenschine and Marean, 1993; Capaldo,
1995,1998a; Blumenschine, 1988; Marean and Kim, 1998;
Selvaggio, 1998a). Cut-marked midshafts can then also provide an
additional line of evidence.
There were 3419 long bone midshaft fragments from the
Blombos sample, but only 1255 ﬁt the rigorous criteria demanded
by the results of the preceding taphonomic analysis (no dry breaks,
recent breaks, poorly-preserved surfaces, or heavily-obscured
surfaces). Because most actualistic data have been reported only for
specimens 2 cm or larger in their maximum dimension, this sample
had to be further reduced to 502 in order to be comparable with
experimental studies in which the agents of bone modiﬁcation are
known (Capaldo, 1995; Dominguez-Rodrigo, 1997; Blumenschine,
1988; Selvaggio, 1998b; Marean et al., 2000). Unfortunately, this
reduced sample hinders statistically robust comparisons between
each body size in each analytical unit at Blombos, particularly for
the small sample from the lower M2 phase (Table 8). Because the
gastric etching data indicated an increased carnivore input for size
1 ungulates, and because this body size comprises a relatively large
proportion of the sample, mammals of this size range are examined

surfaces in the form of percussion, cut, and tooth marks
(Blumenschine, 1988; Blumenschine and Selvaggio, 1988; Marean
et al., 1992; Selvaggio, 1994; Blumenschine et al., 1996;
Dominguez-Rodrigo, 1997; Capaldo, 1998b; Domínguez-Rodrigo
et al., 2007a). Models of carnivore and hominin interaction with
an assemblage have been developed from these data and used to
infer past carcass access scenarios at archaeological sites based on
the frequencies of marked midshaft fragments (Blumenschine,
1995; Capaldo, 1995, 1998a; Dominguez-Rodrigo, 1997; Marean
and Kim, 1998; Selvaggio, 1998a,b; Marean et al., 2000; Selvaggio
and Wilder, 2001; Pickering, 2002; Dominguez-Rodrigo and
Barba, 2006). Examples of these marks from Blombos are given in
Supplementary Online Materials (SOM) Fig. 1.
These experimental studies provide a guide for the interpretation of the frequencies of marked shafts in an assemblage, but there
is a wide array of variables that can inﬂuence how many marks are
inﬂicted and on how many fragments. For example, percussion
marks provide an excellent indication of a speciﬁc activity performed by tool-using hominins (marrow and/or grease extraction),
but their numbers vary according to the shapes and types of stone
used to break the bones, and by the body size of the animal from
which the bone is derived (Pickering and Egeland, 2006; Galán
et al., 2009). Cut marks are also clear indicators of human
activity, but there has been much debate over the utility of using

Figure 8. Proportions of midshafts bearing a percussion mark (black circles), tooth mark (open triangles), or cut mark (x’s) and their 95% conﬁdence intervals for chronological
aggregates at Blombos, compared with actualistic data from known-agent carcass access scenarios (Blumenschine, 1988; Dominguez-Rodrigo, 1997; Capaldo, 1998b; Selvaggio,
1998b; Marean et al., 2000), and compared with DK1 (Marean et al., 2000:215). Comparable data from PP13B and DK1 are also provided (data from Thompson [2010a] and
Marean et al. [2000:215], respectively).

relative to larger body sizes (size 2e4). Small mammals (size 1 and
2) are then also aggregated and examined relative to larger (size 3
and 4) mammals and in comparison with analogous datasets from
the nearby coastal MSA sites of PP13B (Thompson, 2010a) and DK1
(Marean et al., 2000).
If one looks only at the proportions of hominin-modiﬁed midshafts, the taphonomic signature at Blombos is overwhelmingly
one of a ‘hominin ﬁrst’ scenario for all datasets (Fig. 8). The cut
mark and percussion mark data fall well outside the 95% conﬁdence
intervals in ‘three-stage’ experiments where carnivores had ﬁrst
access, followed by hominin scavenging (or a very small degree of
hominin input), and then subsequent further scavenging by carnivores. Both classes of hominin modiﬁcation are also outside or at
the upper limit of Selvaggio’s (1998b) experiments for a carnivore
ﬁrst scenario. However, it should be noted that Selvaggio (1998b)
only reports specimens that have only a cut mark and no other
type of mark, so her actual proportions of cut-marked midshafts are
likely to be slightly greater. The Blombos data do not fall outside the
95% conﬁdence interval for a ‘carnivore to hominin’ scenario
reported by Dominguez-Rodrigo (1997). This experiment has
a wide conﬁdence interval because only his sample where marrow
extraction also took place is illustrated here. The complete sample

includes a ‘carnivore to hominin’ experiment where marrow was
not removed, and this proportion of cut-marked midshafts does fall
well below the observed proportions in all datasets at Blombos
(5.7%, upper C.I. ¼ 11.5%, lower C.I. ¼ 2.6%).
These methodological and sample size issues make interpretation of the Blombos cut mark data somewhat ambiguous, although
a ‘three-stage’ model has been shown to be highly unlikely. The
percussion mark data are clearer, and they speak to a strong
component of human modiﬁcation in that they fall within or above
the 95% conﬁdence intervals for both ‘hominin only’ and ‘hominin
ﬁrst’ scenarios and completely above the ranges for all ‘carnivore
ﬁrst’ scenarios. The percussion data are critical to understanding the
role of human subsistence behaviour in site formation at Blombos
because long bone shafts from which marrow has been removed are
not commonly transported by scavenging carnivores or human
hunters (Marean and Spencer, 1991; Marean and Bertino, 1994).
There is some variability between body size classes in the Blombos
datasets, with large mammals almost always having higher
proportions of marked midshafts. This initially supports the inference from the gastric etching data that smaller ungulates were more
often modiﬁed and/or accumulated by carnivores, but it has also
been shown experimentally that bones from smaller ungulates tend

to exhibit fewer marked midshafts than do bones from larger
ungulates (Galán et al., 2009). This, along with documented variability in the production of percussion marks based on the hammerstone type that is used (Pickering and Egeland, 2006; Galán et al.,
2009), likely also explains why there is no statistical overlap
between ‘hominin only’ percussion mark datasets from
Blumenschine (1988) and Marean et al. (2000).
Fig. 8 also does not show one important aspect of the percussion
data that is particularly relevant to understanding the accumulation and modiﬁcation of the faunal assemblage at the site. Small
long bone ﬂakes bearing a percussion mark often detach and
remain near the original locus of hammerstone percussion (Marean
and Bertino, 1994), but many of these ﬂakes are below the 2 cm cut
off point and are not included in Fig. 8. In all phases combined at
Blombos, there are 471 long bone ﬂakes, 40.1% of which bear
a percussion mark while only 8.7% bear a tooth mark to indicate
that the marrow was accessed by a carnivore (Table 9). This strongly
supports the inference from the proportion of marked shafts that
the primary bone accumulator at Blombos was MSA people.

However, it is also clear that carnivores were involved in the
modiﬁcation of bones at Blombos. Proportions of tooth-marked
midshafts lie at the upper end or just above the 95% conﬁdence
intervals for two of the three experimental scenarios where hominins had primary access to carcasses. The only exception is lower
M2, which shows a very high proportion of tooth-marked size 1/2
mammals and no tooth-marked size 3/4 mammal specimens. The
percussion data are also anomalous for this phase, and show the
opposite pattern. Although the sample size is small, this phase
again stands out as having a relatively high input of small ungulates
from carnivores and an occasional human contribution in the form
of large hunted ungulate remains. For the other phases, the
extensive degree of percussion-marking on midshafts combined
with the consistent presence of cut mark proportions just below
the ‘hominin only’ scenarios point to a predominately ‘hominin
ﬁrst’ situation at Blombos. This is moderated by the tooth mark
data, which agree with the slightly low proportions of cut-marked
midshafts in suggesting that there was a degree of independent
carnivore input and/or a small amount of scavenging by MSA
people from carnivore kills along with substantial carnivore scavenging of human food debris.
The question of independent carnivore input can be addressed
by examining well-preserved midshaft fragments that bear both
a percussion mark and a tooth mark. Experimental studies that
replicate a ‘hominin ﬁrst’ scenario have been shown to result in
a proportion of midshafts with both a percussion and tooth mark
on the same fragment that is close to 5% (Capaldo, 1997, 1998a;
Marean et al., 2000; Egeland et al., 2004). The corrected dataset
(e.g., those fragments 2 cm or larger with well-preserved, unobscured surfaces and no dry breaks) from Blombos for which both
marks occur on the same fragment is small (n ¼ 38) but the
proportion is relatively high at 8.2%. This indicates that many of the
tooth marks on midshafts at Blombos can be attributed to scavenging carnivores (and/or scavenging from carnivores) rather than
an independent carnivore accumulation. This is true for all body
sizes (size 1, 2, 3, and 4 mammals have proportions of 9.3%, 7.3%,
5.7%, and 11.7%, respectively).
Sample sizes are extremely small when the data are divided by
both body size and analytical unit, but M3 does consistently seem
to have a different pattern (Table 10). The proportions of size 1
midshafts bearing both mark types are smaller in M3 than they are
in the other two phases, while proportions of size 2 and size 4
midshafts meeting these criteria are extremely high. This suggests
again that the small ungulates in the lowermost phases at Blombos
underwent a subtly different taphonomic pathway than they did in
more recent phases. This interpretation is in line with chronometric
and stone tool data from Blombos, which suggest a less intense
initial human occupation in the lower phases followed by a shift in
lithic technology after the M3 and lower M2 layers were deposited
(Jacobs et al., 2006; Villa et al., 2009). Importantly, it also indicates
that although there are similarly high proportions of size 1 fauna in
upper M2, lower M2, and M3, these small ungulates were not likely
accumulated by human hunters to the same degree. This has
ramiﬁcations for understanding changes in MSA subsistence
strategies that would not be apparent from body size representation data alone, and may support the inference from Sibudu that
new methods for exploiting small ungulates were developed
around the time of the innovation of the Still Bay techno-complex
in the southern African MSA (Clark and Plug, 2008).
Conclusion
The analysis from Blombos shows several distinctive patterns. In
terms of overall taxonomic representation, the faunal assemblage is
similar to several other coastal MSA sites in the Western Cape, such

764

as DK1 and YS1. The larger mammal assemblage is dominated by
ungulates (especially bovids). Nearly half of these are size 1 antelope, such as grysbok/steenbok. As is typical at many archaeological
sites of this age, there has been a substantial degree of densitymediated destruction. This has resulted in a high representation of
long bone midshafts relative to epiphyseal ends and trabecular
elements. However, this destruction is variable over time and
between body size classes. This, combined with a moderate degree
of post-depositional fragmentation and variable amounts of bone
surface exfoliation, indicates that behavioural inferences of skeletal
element transport and butchery strategies that will be presented
elsewhere cannot reliably proceed without adjustments for
preserved surface area and bone portion representation.
The taphonomic pathways of the fauna from the three main
phases at Blombos were distinctive. When the cave was occupied
approximately 100 ka, small ungulates mainly in the size class of
grysbok and steenbok were sporadically brought to the site by
human hunters and occasionally by small carnivores. These hunters
used an MSA lithic technology that included small blades. The high
proportions of small antelope can likely be attributed to their
relative abundance around the site because of ecological conditions
favouring these species. Both humans and carnivores used Blombos
relatively transiently, with the humans leaving behind evidence of
low-level symbolic behaviour in the form of worked ochre. Carnivores frequently scavenged after human food waste and deposited
additional small ungulate remains on site in the form of partiallydigested bone. The two major modiﬁers of the fauna at this time
(humans and carnivores) left the faunal assemblage depleted in less
dense fragments, such as long bone epiphyseal portions. However,
because of the brief and likely opportunistic nature of the occupation, they inﬂicted only small amounts of post-depositional
breakage on bones that were already present at the site in a dry
state. Between 95 and 85 ka, the human occupation at Blombos was
even more ephemeral, but they did occasionally transport large
ungulate remains to the site. These were broken open for marrow
on site and then scavenged by carnivores. Small ungulates were
also primarily brought to the site independently by carnivores.
After 85 ka, human hunters began to occupy Blombos Cave
either in larger groups or more frequently than they had previously.
These occupants had Still Bay technology and employed varied
forms of external symbolic signalling (such as personal ornamentation). Such differences in material culture may have been
important in mediating larger group sizes. Smaller ungulates were
exploited more commonly by these hunters, perhaps because of an
increase in diet breadth facilitated by the innovation of new
hunting technology. The increased occupation resulted in less
carnivore scavenging, more burning, and relatively more postdepositional breakage. As the climate began to deteriorate into MIS
4, small ungulates became less abundant locally and humans began
to exploit larger ungulates more often. Site use remained at
approximately the same intensity in terms of faunal exploitation
from M2 into M1 times when the cave was eventually closed to
MSA inhabitants.
The work presented here provides the basis for more detailed
studies of MSA butchery, transport, and prey acquisition strategies
at Blombos. These will be dealt with in separate papers, but it is
clear already that humans engaged in at least the ﬁnal stages of
marrow extraction on site for all body sizes and throughout the
MSA occupation of Blombos. As at the nearby sites of DK1 and
PP13B, it was found that the size 1 fauna had the highest degree of
contribution and modiﬁcation by non-human agents, and that this
was variable throughout time (Marean et al., 2000; Thompson,
2010a). The main difference between these sites and Blombos is
that at Blombos, most of the carnivore activity is implicated as
scavenging of human-deposited detritus and the deposition of

partially-digested small ungulate fragments on site, rather than
independent transport of prey to the cave in a nutritive state. These
data together demonstrate that variability in the taphonomic
pathways undertaken by a faunal assemblage can be documented
both between and within sites. This underscores the importance of
a well-described taphonomic study prior to interpreting patterning
in larger mammal fauna at other MSA localities, and indicates that
much is yet to be learnt about variability in MSA faunal exploitation
strategies. It also shows how taphonomic analyses link faunal data
directly into other aspects of human behaviour in a way that goes
far beyond simple descriptions of subsistence strategies.
