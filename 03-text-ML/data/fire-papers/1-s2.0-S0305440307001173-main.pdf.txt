Abstract
The success of radiocarbon dating of burned or cremated bones depends on the exposed temperature during burning and the degree of recrystallisation of the inorganic bone matrix. We present a method for characterisation of likely cremated bones by employing visual inspection,
infrared spectrometry and carbon stable isotope analysis on the bio-apatite fraction. The method of radiocarbon dating of cremated bones was
tested by dating paired samples of bone and associated context materials such as pitch, charcoal and a dendrochronologically dated oak coffin.
The dating of these paired test samples were largely performed as blind tests and showed excellent agreement between pitch and bone. The
weighted mean age difference of all test samples is observed to 9  60 14C yr. To test the indicators and the effects of the degree of burning,
a Late-Neolithic human individual has been studied, as this individual exhibits the full spectrum from low temperature burning (charred) to high
temperature (‘‘cremated’’) from one end of a single bone to the other. This is reflected as a marked step in numerous parameters as well as in
a significant difference in 14C age between the charred and the cremated bone samples.

1. Introduction
Radiocarbon dating of collagen in well-preserved human
bone has routinely been carried out for decades, but cremated
bone samples were always excluded because cremation destroys collagen. However, successful 14C dating of cremated
bones by using their content of re-crystallised bio-apatite
was recently reported by Lanting et al. (2001). To the archaeological community this method was a break-through because
the common burial practice for some prehistoric periods was
cremation, thus opening such cultural periods to 14C dating

of human bones. This is, for example, the case for the late
Danish Bronze Age. Without 14C dating the establishment of
an absolute chronology of the epochs in the late Danish
Bronze Age is difficult.
Radiocarbon dating of bio-apatite is possible because of incorporation of carbonate ions into the inorganic bone matrix in
living organisms. The carbonate ions originate from the energy
production in cells and are substituted with phosphate ions in
the bone matrix into the bio-apatite mineral-like bone structure. (Krueger, 1991; Lee-Thorp and van der Merwe, 1991;
Munro et al., 2007; Newesely, 1988; Pate and Hutton, 1988;
Posner, 1969; Saliège et al., 1995; Sandford, 1993; Wright
and Schwarcz, 1996). By weight the carbonate bone content
corresponds to 0.5% to 1%. However, 14C dating of the bioapatite fraction has for decades been abandoned due to incorrect
14
C results caused by contamination effects (Berger et al.,

792

1964; Hassan et al., 1977; Stafford et al., 1987). In fossil
bones, exchange reactions with the bicarbonate ions dissolved
in soil waters lead to 14C contamination and commonly result
in too young 14C dates of bio-apatite dated samples (Hassan
et al., 1977; Hedges et al., 1995; Surovell, 2000; Tamers and
Pearson, 1965), because bicarbonate in soil waters mostly
originates from root respiration and from cover vegetation,
which produces CO2 when decomposing (Saliège et al.,
1995). Apparently, the exchange reaction with the dissolved
bicarbonate ions does not occur for cremated bones and hence
the bio-apatite fraction of cremated bone yields reliable 14C
results as demonstrated by Lanting et al. (2001).
This is because heating of bones results in numerous microscopic and macroscopic changes which altogether yield
a more robust and inert bio-apatite structure as a consequence.
Heating of bones results in changes in strength and solidity
(Newesely, 1988; Stiner et al., 1995; van Strydonck et al.,
2005). Furthermore, burned bones develop cracks and show
considerable shrinkage (Holden et al., 1995; Shipman et al.,
1984). Along with these morphological alterations colour
changes are also observed as a function of temperature such
that bones burned at temperatures lower than approximately
600  C appear black in contrast to bones burned at temperatures higher than 600  C, which appear white (Holden et al.,
1995; Shipman et al., 1984). After cremation, bones are very
fragile and prone to fragmentation (Stiner et al., 1995), but
they regain their strength by absorption of water by returning
to an apatite structure forming larger crystals (van Strydonck
et al., 2005). The most dramatic changes occur at temperatures
above 600  C observed by enhanced crystal growth (Grupe
and Hummel, 1991; Holden et al., 1995; Shipman et al.,
1984; Stiner et al., 1995). Above this temperature the apatite-like structure instantaneously re-crystallises into larger
crystals (Holden et al., 1995; Shipman et al., 1984). Loss of
CO2 is also associated with heating of bones (Grupe and
Hummel, 1991; Haas and Banewicz, 1980; Newesely, 1988;
Shipman et al., 1984; Stiner et al., 1995). At temperatures
lower than 225  C weight losses are caused by evaporation
of water, whereas weight losses at temperatures between
225  C and 500  C are due to the combustion of the organic
bone fraction. At still higher temperatures weight losses are
caused by the decomposition of structural carbonate by release
of CO2. It has been shown that the presence of carbonate ions
in the bio-apatite structure causes strains in the crystal structure of the bio-apatite as observed by a broadening in the
peaks of X-ray diffraction and infrared (IR) spectroscopy patterns (Person et al., 1995; Posner, 1969; Shipman et al., 1984).
Furthermore it has been shown by X-ray diffraction and IR
spectroscopy that the loss of structural carbonate is associated
with an increasing crystalline structure of the bone bio-apatite
(Person et al., 1995; Shipman et al., 1984).
To confuse matters, the inorganic bone crystals are gradually altered by diagenetic processes at ambient temperatures,
where large crystals tend to grow at the expense of small
ones; a process which may occur over millennia (Krueger,
1991; Lee-Thorp and van der Merwe, 1991; Person et al.,
1995; Shipman et al., 1984; Stiner et al., 1995). Therefore,

crucial to radiocarbon dating of cremated or burned bones is
knowledge about the degree of bio-apatite re-crystallisation
in order to ensure that they are unaffected by exchange processes with dissolved soil bicarbonate. It is therefore essential
to characterise the degree of crystallisation in the bone samples to be 14C dated. To this end the cremated bones of humans
in this study have been characterised by visual inspection, IR
spectroscopy (crystallinity index (CI) and the carbonate to
phosphate ratio (C/P)), d13C of bio-apatite and the carbon
weight percentage. The 14C age of the cremated bones is measured and the results are compared to 14C measurements of
sample associated context material like pitch and charcoal.
The differences between the 14C content of the cremated
bone samples and their associated context materials is evaluated as a function of the degree of burning in order to estimate
the limitations of 14C dating of cremated bones. Note that in
the present paper, bones showing clear properties of being
burned at temperatures higher than approximately 600  C
are denoted cremated bones. Whereas bones not displaying
these properties are denoted burned or charred bones.
2. Methods
2.1. Sample preparation
2.1.1. Cremated bone samples
Two grams of bone sample is soaked in a 1.5% sodium hypochlorite solution to dissolve remaining organic material
(48 h, 20  C). The sample is then washed and submerged in
1 M acetic acid to remove post-depositional carbonates as
well as less crystalline, soluble fractions of bio-apatite (24 h,
20  C). Next the sample is washed and dried (12 h, 80  C)
with a bio-apatite yield of approximately 96%. The pre-treated
sample is crushed and 1.5 g is treated with 100% de-hydrated
phosphoric acid (8 h, 25  C) to liberate CO2 from which sulphur impurities are removed prior conversion to graphite for
AMS targets (Ambrose, 1993; Lanting et al., 2001; Lee-Thorp
and van der Merwe, 1991).
2.1.2. Charcoal and pitch samples
Samples for radiocarbon dating were pre-treated by the
acid-alkali-acid (AAA) method prior to conversion to CO2
by burning in sealed evacuated ampoules with CuO. The
AAA method is as follows: 1 M HCl (80  C 24 h) followed
by 1 M NaOH (80  C one to several days) and finally 1 M
HCl (Thomsen, 1990).
Part of the resulting CO2 gas was used for d13C analysis on
a GV Instruments Isoprime stable isotope mass spectrometer
to a precision of 0.15&, while the rest was converted to graphite for AMS 14C measurements via reduction with H2 using
cobalt as a catalyst (Vogel, 1984). All AMS 14C measurements
were carried out using the EN tandem accelerator at the University of Aarhus (Denmark). The dating results are reported
as conventional 14C dates in 14C yr BP based on the measured
14 13
C/ C ratio corrected for the natural isotopic fractionation by
normalising the result to the standard d13C value of 25&
PDB (Andersen et al., 1989).

2.2. Visible inspection of bones
All samples have been visually inspected for surface and interior colour and burn cracks. As part of the burning process
cremated human bone undergoes a range of changes in colour
which varies from a charred black appearance through a range
of shades of grey and grey/blue to white (Brickley, 2007).
Through experimental work it has been demonstrated that
the range of colours produced in burned bone are extremely
complex and cannot simply be equated with how hot the fire
was (Mays, 1998). Among others the availability of oxygen
is very important during burning (Walker and Miller, 2005).
Burn cracks are reported to develop at temperature above
600  C (Shipman et al., 1984; Stiner et al., 1995).

2.3. IR spectroscopy
IR spectra of the bio-apatite bone fraction are represented
by vibration bands of mainly CO3 and PO4 giving absorption
peaks at 710, 874 and 1415 cm1 and 565, 603 and 1035 cm1
of CO3 and PO4 respectively (Garvie-Lok et al., 2004; Stiner
et al., 1995; Wright and Schwarcz, 1996). The carbonate absorption peak at 710 cm1 is characteristic of CaCO3 and
can therefore be used to detect absorbed CaCO3 contaminants
(Wright and Schwarcz, 1996). As the absorption peak height at
1415 cm1 and 1035 cm1 is proportional to the content of
carbonate and phosphate, the carbonate content of the samples
was estimated by the C/P ratio given as C/P ¼ A1415/A1035
(Garvie-Lok et al., 2004; Wright and Schwarcz, 1996). The
C/P ratio of fresh bone is approximately 0.23 (Garvie-Lok
et al., 2004).
IR spectroscopy provides information on the crystallinity of
the analysed bio-apatite, and thus on the degree of re-crystallisation of the sample bones. The crystallinity is a function of
the extent of splitting of the two absorption bands at 603 and
565 cm1. The crystallinity index (CI) or degree of splitting
can be estimated by drawing a baseline between 750 and
495 cm1 and measuring the heights of the absorption lines
at 603 cm1 (A) and 565 cm1 (B). The sum of the absorption
lines A and B divided by the distance from the baseline to the
valley between them gives the CI, defined as: CI ¼ (A603 þ
A565)/Avalley (Garvie-Lok et al., 2004; Weiner and Bar-Yosef,
1990; Wright and Schwarcz, 1996). The CI is a function of
temperature where increasing burning temperatures increase
the re-crystallisation and thus the CI factor. A CI factor of 3
indicates burning at low temperatures or diagenetic alterations.
CI factors above 4 indicate partial re-crystallisation whereas
a CI factor around 7 indicates complete re-crystallisation
(Stiner et al., 1995). Non-burned bones show a CI factor
around 2 to 2.9 (Garvie-Lok et al., 2004; Stiner et al.,
1995). Thus, a high CI value is an indication of a high burning
temperature.
IR spectroscopy was performed on powdered pretreated
sample material, i.e. bio-apatite. The sample material was
mixed with KBr and hydraulically pressed into pellets prior
to measurement of infrared spectra with a Perkin Elmer

793

FTIR spectrometer (Paragon 1000). The spectrum of KBr
was automatically subtracted by an online computer.
3. Results
The tests performed in this study can be divided into two
subsets: (1) 11 samples were age tested against associated reference material and (2) measurements were performed on
different bone sections from a Late-Neolithic individual exhibiting a varying degree of burning from charred to cremated
bone in order to characterise the parameters reflecting this variation. The radiocarbon measurements were performed on two
graphite targets produced in most instances from the same
aliquot of sample CO2, but measured at different times in
the accelerator to avoid possible biases between 14C analysis
batches. Furthermore, about half of the sample sets presented
here was submitted blind, i.e. no prior knowledge of intersample dependencies was available to the AMS laboratory
during analysis.
3.1. Samples with associated reference material
Eleven cremated human bone samples have been measured
and compared to context dated material associated with the
samples. One sample was tested against a dendrochronologically dated oak coffin, 6 against pitch sealing material from
the cremation urns and 4 against charcoal. Five of the 11 samples where blind tested, i.e. they were submitted with no information but an ID number. All samples were visually inspected
for surface and interior colour and presence of burn cracks.
The data are given in Table 1.
The human remains of the young (16e18 years old) woman
in the coffin from Egtved grave were rather poor due to the humid environmental conditions; only her hair, 29 dental crowns,
some of the nails and skin were preserved (Thomsen, 1929). In
contrast to this, a number of bones which were found in two
places in the coffin (at the young woman’s head and left leg)
with an appearance similar to regular cremated bone samples
found in urns (same colour, structure, fragmentation and
form). Fragments of the jaws indicated a child of 5e6 years.
Cremated bones of this child were used for our dating
(AAR-8789).
The 14C date of these bones was tested against the dendrochronological date of the oak coffin, 1370 BC (Christensen,
2006). This calendar age is converted to a 14C age via the
14
C calibration curve (IntCal04, Reimer et al., 2004) to give
a 14C date of 3054  16 BP (see Fig. 1). Thus, the resulting
age difference between AAR-8789 and the dendro date is
74  32 14C yr. Hence the two samples almost agree within
2s, or in other words the probability that two samples are of
similar 14C age is 5%.
Six samples (AAR-8110, -8111, -8112, -9571, -9573 and
-9576) were collected from burial urns from different sites.
The radiocarbon dates of the pitch used to seal these urns is
expected to be of similar age as the cremated bones and
may serve as age control (Sauter et al., 2001). The age difference between the cremated bone sample AAR-9571 and its

Fig. 2. 14C age difference between samples and their associated context material. The 14C dates of the associated context materials are determined by either
dendrochronology (see Fig. 1) or 14C measurements of pitch and charcoal.
Note that sample AAR-8783 is not shown due to an undetermined CI value
of this sample. One pitch sample is considered an outlier and the charcoal samples are apparently influenced by the old wood effect (see text and Table 1).

associated pitch sample AAR-9568 amounts to 8 standard deviations and is not included in the statistical analysis. Unlike
the bone date, the pitch date is incompatible with the archaeological date, pointing to an erroneous identification of the
sample. For the remaining samples the weighted average age
difference between cremated bone samples and pitch is
þ26  26 14C yr (c2meas : 2.7  9.0). Hence the cremated
bone samples and their related pitch samples are in excellent
general agreement.
Four samples (AAR-8195, -8196, -8197 and -8783) were
tested against a charcoal dated context. The weighted average
age of the three charcoal samples (AAR-8198, -8199 and
-8200) from the Hammelev site is 8982  35 BP (c2meas :
3.8  6.0, see Table 1) yielding a weighted average age difference between the cremated bone samples and the charcoal
samples of this site of 140  34 14C yr (c2meas : 25.0  7.8).
Thus the cremated bone samples are on average 140 14C yr
younger than their context related charcoal samples. However,
the charcoal dates may be affected by the ‘‘old wood’’ effect,
and if we instead use the youngest charcoal date (AAR-8200:
8875  65 BP) for comparison as the date least affected by
this effect, then the bone-charcoal 14C age difference amounts
to only 31  87 14C yr (c2meas : 3.6  7.8).
The 14C age difference between the cremated bone samples
and their associated reference materials are shown in Fig. 2
as a function of CI.

the right femur. It was obvious that the individual had been
cremated in the grave. The bones were burnt in different degrees, but they were still articulated and in situ. Some of the
bones were white, while others had an almost blue or charred
appearance. Grave goods consisted, among other things, of
a 20 cm long dagger of flint, type IIa (Lomborg, 1973), which
had been burnt. This dagger is a status symbol connected to
the male sphere. Based on the grave goods, the grave is dated
to the late Neolithic. Furthermore the grave gods reveal that
this buried individual probably was a male, which was confirmed by the bioanthropological study of the skeleton.
Three bones of this partially cremated individual have been
studied and 14C dated; the left and right humeri (upper arms)
and the left radius (lower arm bone), see Table 2. The study of
the left radius in 7 sections from its proximal to its distal end
(AAR-9390 to AAR-9396) shows the full spectrum from
charred to cremated bone in all measured parameters. Visual
observation reveals that the samples go from totally black
charred bone with no indications of burn cracks to completely
white bone with clear indications of burn cracks (see Fig. 3).
Also the CI shows values from 3.5, indicative of low temperature burning (charred), to high temperature at 5.0 (cremated)
(see Figs. 4 and 5). This tendency is further observed in the
d13C values of the dated bio-apatite fraction going from
16& for charred samples to 23& for fully cremated as
well as in the carbon weight percentage (C wt%) and the carbonate to phosphate ratio (C/P) as displayed in Fig. 5. The
charred sample from the left upper arm (AAR-8785) shows
the same values as the charred samples from the left radius,
whereas the right upper arm (AAR-8784) has been exposed
to a higher temperature than the left, although not with indicative signs of temperatures above 600  C (cremation) (see
Fig. 5). Note that AAR-8784 and AAR-8785 were submitted
as part of the blind test.

Østerhoved, Sealand
A fortunate find of an individual with bones of different degrees of burning was made at Østerhoved, south of Skælskør,
Sealand (parish of Magleby), in an excavation by the Danish
National Museum of one of a cluster of four burial mounds
(Krause, in press). The find consisted of the buried individual’s
cranium, torso, pelvic bones, upper and lower armbones, and

The analysis data of the left radius, left upper arm and the right upper arm (preparation yield, carbon weight percentage, carbonate to phosphate ratio, crystallinity
index, d13C of the bio-apatite bone fraction, 14C age and outcome of visual inspection) are shown. The left radius (AAR-9390 to AAR-9396) exhibits the full
spectrum from charred bone to cremated bone (see also Figs. 3, 5 and 6).

(AAR-8785: 3576  29 BP) are very similar, with an average
14
C age of 3596  20 BP. The 14C date of the right upper arm
(AAR-8784: 3682  43 BP) falls somewhere between the
charred and the cremated samples of the left radius (AAR9390 and AAR-9396), in agreement with the trend in the other
parameters (see Figs. 5 and 6). The age difference between the
average charred bone samples and the fully cremated one
(AAR-9396: 3756  28 BP) of the Late-Neolithic individual
is significant, 160  34 14C yr. Unfortunately, no reference
material was available from the grave to provide a context
14
C date for comparison, but theoretically one would rely on
the date of fully cremated bone as discussed below.
4. Discussion
In general the cremated bone and the associated context
dated samples are in excellent agreement with a weighted
mean difference of 9  60 14C yr (see Table 1 and Fig. 2).

However, all cremated bone samples associated with charcoal
dated context samples appear younger with age differences up
to 220 14C yr. Commonly, charcoal is not a preferred material
for accurate comparisons due to the ‘‘old wood’’ effect as also
noted by Lanting et al. (2001) who observed large age differences in some cases when using charcoal as context dated reference material for cremated bone samples. In contrast, pitch
is likely to represent the perfect context material for cremated
bone samples as it seems reasonable that urns are sealed very
shortly after the time of death of the individual and that the
pitch has been extracted mainly from the outer tree rings or
bark from live or fairly fresh trees such as birch (Sauter
et al., 2001). Therefore, the excellent agreement between the
paired bone and pitch samples with an overall age difference
of þ26  26 14C yr confirms the reliability of the method of
radiocarbon dating of cremated bones. However, the overall
internal consistency of the data as reflected by the large scatter
(Table 1), indicates that other factors than the ‘‘old wood’’

end (AAR-9390) to the cremated samples in the other end (AAR-9396).

(AAR-9396). Note the higher splitting of the absorption peaks at 603 cm1

the lower carbonate content as seen by reduced absorption peak at 1415 cm1.

effect may be at play. It may be noted that the CI values of the
test samples range from about 2.5 and up to 6.5, thus their
values span from normal bones to bones burned above
600  C (see Fig. 2 and Table 2). Strikingly, a correlation between the degree of re-crystallisation, i.e. burn temperature
as represented by the CI values and the age difference between
the cremated bone samples and their associated context material cannot be observed. On the other hand this may reflect the
absence of in situ contamination unlike the partial cremated
individual.
The age discrepancy between the cremated bone sample
AAR-8789 (see Table 1) and the associated dendrochronologically dated oak coffin is very large and close to disagreement.
As the bone sample turn out to be older than the coffin raises
the interesting question of a marine or freshwater diets

influencing the 14C age of an individual as is commonly
known from radiocarbon dating on the collagen fraction of
human bones (see e.g. Ambrose, 1993; Ambrose and Norr,
1993; Arneborg et al., 1999; Bonsall et al., 2004; Cook
et al., 2001; DeNiro and Epstein, 1978; Fischer et al., in
pressa,b; Noe-Nygaard, 1988; Noe-Nygaard et al., 2005;
Richards and Hedges, 1999; Richter and Noe-Nygaard,
2003). In general the bio-apatite bone fraction may offer an alternative material for paleodietary studies (Garvie-Lok et al.,
2004; Hedges, 2003; Koch et al., 1997; Lee-Thorp and van
der Merwe, 1991; Passey et al., 2005), but unfortunately there
is not yet a direct method for obtaining paleodietary information by the bio-apatite fraction on cremated bones. Paleodietary studies on bone collagen reflects mainly the protein
component of the diet (Hedges, 2003; Milner et al., 2004;
Schwarcz, 2000), in contrast to paleodietary studies applying
the bio-apatite fraction where the d13C values reflects whole
diet of the individual including lipids and carbohydrates and
in-excess protein (Hedges, 2003). Therefore it is believed
that the bio-apatite fraction is less liable to 14C reservoir effects in contrast to the collagen (protein) fraction when derived
from protein rich marine diets. On the other hand, very little is
known about the isotope fractionation during the cremation
process though it seems clear that the burning of bones yields
very negative and more and less similar d13C values (this study
and Lanting et al., 2001). This may suggest that the CO2 loss
during the burn process of bones blurs the original dietary information contained in the bio-apatite bone fraction. Nevertheless, assuming that the age discrepancy is solely caused by
a diet consisting partially of marine food and using a marine
reservoir age of 400 yr this individual (AAR-8789) ends up
with a marine diet of approximately 19%. Hence, the age discrepancy between the sample AAR-8789 and the oak coffin
may suggest that the well known problems of 14C reservoir effects on dating the collagen bone fraction may be significant in
some instances on cremated bones as well. This is clearly

Fig. 5. Shown is the samples of ‘‘partial burned’’ Late-Neolithic individual as function of d13C, CI, C wt% and the C/P ratio. Note that the CI axis is inverted. The
sample AAR-8785 is charred whereas the sample AAR-8784 is partial cremated. The samples from AAR-9390 to AAR-9396 reflect a gradual change from charred
to cremated (see text, Table 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 6 for further details).

J. Olsen et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 791e800

a matter that needs further clarification and investigation. Alternatively, the CI values of the individual (AAR-8789, Table 1)
is very low and similar to CI values of normal unburned
bones. Hence it is possible that the re-crystallisation process
of the bio-apatite bone fraction towards more robust crystals
has not taken place for this sample, i.e. individual AAR-8979
is likely to have been exposed to low temperature burning.
Hence this opens the possibility of exchange reactions with
soil carbonate and may thereby potentially explain the observed age offset between the coffin and bone.
The Late-Neolithic individual exhibiting bones from
charred to cremated clearly displays significant changes in
all observed parameters (CI, C wt%, C/P ratio and d13C
values) on going from charred bones to cremated bones (see
Fig. 5 and Table 2). The transitional step (Fig. 5) may indicate
that the re-crystallisation process of the bone matrix may only
occur above some threshold temperature as observed by others
(Holden et al., 1995; Munro et al., 2007; Shipman et al., 1984;
Stiner et al., 1995). This strongly suggests that these parameters are very useful to indicate whether samples have been exposed to high temperature burning (i.e. cremation) or not.
Interestingly the 14C dates of the charred and cremated bones
do not statistically agree (c2meas : 23.1  7.8) and thus yields
a 14C age difference between charred and cremated bones of
-160  34 14C yr in this case, see also Fig. 6. Hence, indicating that charred bones may turn out younger than cremated
bones in concord with the hypothesis of exchange reactions
with soil derived carbonate ions of higher 14C activity when
bones are exposed to low temperature burning, i.e. re-crystallisation processes of the bone matrix has not taken place.
Post-burial diagenetic changes of charred samples due to
only a partial bone matrix re-crystallisation during burning
may further explain the observed strong correlations between
the measured 14C dates and the CI, C/P ratio, C wt% and d13C
values displaying correlation coefficients of 0.85, 0.84,

0.86 and 0.98 respectively (see Table 2 and Fig. 6 as an example). However, note that these correlations are obtained from
only 4 samples and they may therefore be unrepresentative.
5. Conclusion
The study of a Late-Neolithic partially burned individual
demonstrated an age difference of about 160 14C yr between
charred and cremated bones which stresses the importance
of characterising bones to be radiocarbon dated by the cremated bone method (Lanting et al., 2001). By employing infrared spectrometry and d13C analysis on the bio-apatite
fraction of the Late-Neolithic individual, it has been demonstrated that a remarkably steep transition in parameters such
as CI, d13C, C/P ratio and C wt% occurs. Hence this significant difference between charred and cremated bones may successfully be applied to determine whether bone samples have
been exposed to temperatures above 600  C. This characterisation is critical for successful 14C dating of cremated bones as
the bio-apatite mineral structure becomes more inert to external influences when burned above 600  C.
The excellent agreement between the 11 paired samples of
cremated bones and associated context samples such as a
dendrochronological dated oak coffin, pitch and charcoal
(of which about half were blind tested) generally confirmed
the positive results found by Lanting et al. (2001). However,
the large age difference between the bio-apatite bone sample
and the associated dendrochronological date illustrate that other
factors may be at play. Reservoir effects in human bones
samples are well known from paleodietary studies of bone
collagen and to a lesser extend as well from studies on the
bio-apatite fraction of bones. It is likely that the reservoir effects
may influence 14C dating of cremated bones in a similar way,
a point that deserves further clarification and investigation.
