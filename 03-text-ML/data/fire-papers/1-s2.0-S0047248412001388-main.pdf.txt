Neandertals were effective hunters of large ungulates throughout their geographic and temporal ranges.
Equipped with this knowledge, researchers in paleoanthropology continue to seek insight on the relationships between hunting and subsistence strategies with other components of the Neandertals’ niche,
such as mobility, site use, and lithic technology. The Quina Mousterian deposits from the rockshelter site
of Chez Pinaud Jonzac (Charente-Maritime, France; hereafter Jonzac) offer an excellent opportunity to
pursue these issues. This paper focuses on the extensive and well-preserved skeletal remains of reindeer
(Rangifer tarandus) recovered from recent excavations of the site, representing at least 18 individuals that
were hunted by Neandertals during the fall through winter. Our zooarchaeological results indicate that
all ages of reindeer were hunted but adult individuals predominate. No bias is evident in the comparable
frequencies of males and females. These prey were butchered on-site, with abundant evidence of meat
ﬁlleting and marrow exploitation. In the excavated sample, the absence of hearths and the almost
complete lack of burned bones or stones suggest that Neandertals were not using ﬁre to assist with
processing the reindeer carcasses. The zooarchaeological results presented here indicate that reindeer
were hunted during a restricted window of time when they were seasonally abundant in the local area
near Jonzac. Taken together with the lithic industry based on bifacial elements, the evidence is consistent
with a pattern of site use by highly mobile hunter-gatherers making frequent, short-term visits. Ongoing
research at Jonzac and other Quina Mousterian localities will contribute to a better understanding of
Neandertal behavior during cold climate phases.

Introduction
The debate over whether Neandertals acquired large game
through hunting versus scavenging has been settled towards
hunting. Throughout their range, Neandertals consistently exploited large mammals by hunting them, butchering them, and
extracting marrow and other nutritional sources from them. Now
questions remain about the meaning of variation within this

general pattern, and researchers aim to reconstruct the spatial and
temporal organization of the Neandertals’ subsistence economy.
Some current research questions include: Do subsistence practices
vary with lithic technology? How does subsistence interact with
technology to inﬂuence mobility and landscape and site use? To
what extent did Neandertals subsist on large game to the exclusion
of smaller animal resources? Were some animal resources exploited seasonally and others used throughout the year? Were multiple
animals taken at once and if so, was surplus stored? Neandertals
were specialists in hunting large ungulates in general, but did they
sometimes intentionally specialize on a single ungulate taxon?
Here we aim to investigate questions about Neandertal large
game hunting associated with the Quina Mousterian and its

L. Niven et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 63 (2012) 624e635

relationship to site use and mobility. The Quina Mousterian (typically considered to have been made during Oxygen Isotope Stage
(OIS) 4, about 71,000e59,000 years ago) provides a good context
for further investigation into some of these questions about
Neandertal subsistence strategies because of its distinct tool technology and frequent association with reindeer-dominated, cold
period faunas (e.g., Delagnes and Rendu, 2011; Discamps et al.,
2011). Quina lithic assemblages are characterized by a high
percentage of scrapers, including typical Quina scrapers made on
large, thick blanks and with invasive, stepped retouch. Cores are
extremely scarce but ﬂakes are abundant, both from tool manufacture and maintenance. The tools reﬂect versatility and long uselife, such as highly curated scrapers that were transportable and
could be transformed for speciﬁc needs (e.g., Meignen, 1988;
Hiscock et al., 2009). Quina blank production techniques have
been described by Turq (1989) and clariﬁed by Bourguignon (1996).
These studies suggest a ‘Quina method’ quasi-speciﬁc of this
Mousterian lithic technocomplex. At Jonzac, an additional component of the Quina technology is represented by the use of bifacial
shaping to prepare large, thick blanks for Quina type scrapers
(Lenoir, 2004; Soressi, 2004). This technique is also present in the
Quina Mousterian of La Quina (Park, 2007). Although the Quina
toolkit varies among sites to some degree, it is generally suited for
highly mobile hunteregatherers because of its multifunctional and
adaptable items (Hiscock et al., 2009). Most faunal assemblages
associated with the Quina Mousterian are dominated by reindeer,
e.g., the nearby Charentian sites of Les Pradelles/Marillac
(Costamagno et al., 2005, 2006) and La Quina (Armand, 1998), as
well as Pech de l’Azé IV (Laquay, 1981; Niven, in press), Roc de
Marsal (Turq et al., 2008; Castel, 2010), Combe Grenal, and Vaufrey
(Delpech, 1996). The consistency of abundant reindeer indicates
that these assemblages all accumulated in cold, dry, and open
environments and perhaps contemporaneously (possibly all during
OIS 4). However, there are a few exceptions of Quina Mousterian
assemblages not dominated by reindeer, particularly outside the
Charente and Périgord regions, such as Agenais, Quercy, Sous-lesVignes and Le Mas-Viel (Turq et al., 1999), where large bovids
and/or horse are dominant, or such as Espagnac (Brugal, 2001)
where horse is equal to or only slightly better represented than
reindeer. Bison and horse are often associated with reindeer in
fossil assemblages, but because neither is a strict indicator of cold
conditions, these sites may reﬂect variations in season, time,
geography, topography or other ecological factors. Geography or
season have been offered as explanations for Espagnac (Jaubert
et al., 2001) and the technological attributions of Sous-les-Vignes
and Le Mas-Viel have been questioned (Discamps et al., 2011).
Because of its large sample size and good preservation, the
reindeer assemblage from the Quina Mousterian bonebed (Level
22) at Jonzac, France, offers an excellent opportunity to further
evaluate large mammal exploitation by Neandertals during this
period. This assemblage, combined with a few additional samples
(e.g., Les Pradelles/Marillac, Pech de l’Azé IV and Roc de Marsal) that
were excavated with modern techniques and analyzed using
current zooarchaeological approaches, allows us to begin to
reconstruct subsistence behavior and site use by these highly
mobile Neandertal groups.
Research history at Jonzac
Chez Pinaud Jonzac (hereafter Jonzac) is a collapsed rockshelter
situated in the valley of the Seugne River, a tributary of the Charente River, in the Charente-Maritime region of southwest France.
An initial campaign of excavations was undertaken by Airvaux
(Airvaux, 2004; Airvaux and Soressi, 2005) between 1998 and
2003, and was followed by a new program from 2004 to 2007

directed by J. Jaubert and J.-J. Hublin in collaboration with S.
McPherron and M. Soressi with teams from Université Bordeaux 1/
Laboratory CNRS PACEA (France) and the Department of Human
Evolution in the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (Leipzig, Germany) (Jaubert et al., 2008). The goals of the
recent excavations included clariﬁcation of the Middle to Upper
Paleolithic stratigraphy, conducting a geoarchaeological study,
reﬁning the chronology through radiocarbon and luminescence (TL
and OSL) dating, obtaining bone samples for stable isotope analyses
(Richards et al., 2008; Britton et al., 2011), and obtaining a better
understanding of the lithic industries, including functional analyses
(Claud, 2008).
Airvaux recognized 24 layers deﬁned primarily on the basis of
archaeological criteria. One feature of the sequence is the presence
of sterile sediments separating archaeological ﬁnd horizons. In
general, Airvaux used even numbers to denominate layers with
archaeological ﬁnds and odd numbers to denominate the intervening sterile layers. The new excavations followed Airvaux’s
system with only the addition of some sublevels, especially in the
thicker archaeological deposits at the base of the sequence. Thus,
particularly in the deepest levels of the site, the numeric portions of
the layer names reported here correlate with those already reported by Airvaux (2004) and Airvaux and Soressi (2005). However,
a designation was added to each layer indicating the section of the
site in which they were excavated (E ¼ east, SW ¼ southwest, and
W ¼ west) as well as the preﬁx US (unité stratigraphique). Eventually, the west and southwest sections were stratigraphically
connected during the course of the excavation, but the SW and W
distinction was retained in order to provide continuity with
previous publications. However, the east and west sections are not
connected stratigraphically and while the two sequences are
overall similar, individual layer numbers are not strictly correlated.
The Middle Paleolithic sequence at Jonzac starts just above
bedrock at the base with a nearly 1.5 m thick bonebed deposit (WUS22 hereafter Level 22) that is extremely rich in well-preserved
faunal remains associated with a Quina Mousterian lithic industry
(Fig. 1A). The current study focuses on the reindeer remains from
this assemblage. Several lenses (W-US20 through W-US10) of
alternating Quina Mousterian and sterile sediments follow. A
signiﬁcant change in the sequence is represented by SW-US8
(hereafter Level 8), in which Denticulate Mousterian industries of
Levallois technology are abundant but the faunal accumulation is
less dense and bones are poorly preserved. SW-US7 and -US6
(hereafter Levels 7 and 6) are marked by Mousterian of Acheulian
Tradition (MTA) lithic industries and less well-preserved fauna. An
isolated Neandertal tooth was recovered from Level 7 (Richards
et al., 2008). Evidence of the retreat of the rockshelter is seen in
the MTA levels in the form of abundant limestone blocks.
The Quina Mousterian of Level 22 is notable in the Jonzac
sequence for its density of faunal remains, which look to have
accumulated in several discrete episodes resulting in a substantial
bonebed (Fig. 1B). Bones were in an excellent state of preservation,
including some skeletal parts still in anatomical articulation
(Fig. 1C).
The faunal remains from the Quina Mousterian of the Airvaux
excavation campaign were analyzed and published by Beauval
(2004), who documented similar species representation to that
found in our study. Beauval’s sample comes from an initial test unit
(w2 m2), which we then expanded to a surface of w5.5 m2. It was
expected that there would be signiﬁcant differences between the
assemblages in terms of taxa represented, although his overall
number of ﬁnds was smaller (NISP ¼ 2672), and he identiﬁed wolf
(n ¼ 2) and lion (n ¼ 1) amongst his material. Comparing the
percent NISP (number of identiﬁed specimens) of reindeer skeletal
elements between the two samples from Level 22 shows nearly

626

but diagnostic (e.g., tooth, tarsal, sesamoid), it was also recorded
separately. A faunal analyst was available nearly all the time to
assist with these determinations and to help with recognizing
anatomical connections. All sediment was water-screened through
ﬁne mesh (2 and 5 mm). The high density of fauna (up to an average
of 15 piece-plotted bones per liter of sediment) and relatively high
density of lithics (up to an average of four piece-plotted stones per
liter of sediment) in the Quina Mousterian deposit was particularly
challenging to excavate. Because of the bone densities and in part to
better document horizontal patterning, we used a décapage
approach in which sediments were removed using ﬁne utensils to
expose a surface of bones. After photographs were taken, all
specimens were mapped in place and removed for analysis and
curation. The completeness of the faunal assemblage is illustrated
in Fig. 2, which shows that all portions of the long bone shaft are
represented and that diagnostic articular ends were not preferentially collected or analyzed (e.g., Marean et al., 2004).
Every piece-plotted faunal specimen was analyzed for this
study. Long bone shaft splinters were abundant and identiﬁed to
element whenever possible. Evaluation of bone surfaces for
modiﬁcations was conducted with the aid of a strong primary light
source and a 15 hand lens. In regard to cut, percussion and
carnivore tooth marks, only unambiguous examples were recorded.
We used reference skeletal collections from the PACEA Laboratory
(Université Bordeaux 1) and the Department of Human Evolution in
the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology to help
identify the faunal assemblage.
We employ four analytical units to quantify the Jonzac reindeer
assemblage. These include the number of identiﬁed specimens
(NISP), minimum number of elements (MNE) both by landmark and

identical results, except for the higher number of ribs in our analysis. Although the faunas from both excavation campaigns are
likely part of the same deposit at least for this level, we restrict our
discussion of results in this paper to those from our own study.

comprehensive counts, minimum number of individuals (MNI), and
the minimum number of animal units in raw form (MAU) and
standardized form (%MAU). The latter method is useful for recognizing prey transport and processing decisions by prehistoric
people from archaeofaunal assemblages (Binford, 1984).
Age-at-death estimates of reindeer were assessed using epiphyseal fusion of long bones and dental eruption and wear. These
methods can also be used to investigate the season of hunting and
site use. Because Rangifer has restricted mating and birthing
periods, it is possible to compare the stage of tooth development of
fossil specimens with those of known-age modern animals (Miller,
1974) to estimate age-at-death. Animals less than one year old are
most suitable to this type of analysis. Older animals with teeth still
erupting are also useful but sometimes not as precise (Enloe and
David, 1997; Enloe, 2003).
To further investigate seasonality, we conducted skeletochronological analysis of tooth cementum increments, based on
the premise that in many mammalian populations, cementum
growth follows predictable seasonal cycles with an alternation of
a fast-growth deposit during the warm season and a slow-growth
deposit during the cold season (e.g., Klevezal’ and Kleinenberg,
1969; Lieberman and Meadow, 1992; Burke and Castanet, 1995;
Klevezal’, 1996; Diekwisch, 2001). The outermost increment,
forming at the time of death, is assumed to give a precise estimation of the season of death. To conduct skeletochronological analysis on the Jonzac assemblage, two thin sections of each tooth were
created and observed under polarized transmitted light microscopy
at 40, 100 and 200 magniﬁcation following commonly used
protocols (e.g., Wall, 2005; Pike-Tay et al., 2008; Rendu, 2010).
Alterations from weathering, microbes, and diagenesis were
systematically evaluated following Stutz (2002a,b) to assess the
integrity of the outermost cementum increment and to eliminate
altered teeth from the analysis, when necessary. Estimation of
season of death followed methods developed by previous
researchers (e.g., Pike-Tay et al., 1999) based on identifying the
nature of the last cementum deposit and in cases where it was
a fast-growth increment, its relative width was compared with the
previous identical increment. Computerized image analysis of
digitized pictures of thin sections was conducted to measure
consecutive growth zone widths when quantitative data were
available (Lieberman et al., 1990). These results were then
compared with data from published modern comparative collections of Pike-Tay (1995). Considering that identifying the last
increments can sometimes be difﬁcult, each tooth was blindly
observed (context information removed) four times, which ensures
intra-observer reproducibility of the analysis. The ﬁnal season-ofdeath determination was accepted only when the four observations agreed.
Sex ratios were determined by means of osteometric measurements taken on fully fused adult skeletal elements (following von
den Driesch, 1976). Although a variety of elements of the sexually
dimorphic Rangifer can potentially provide information on the
abundances of males and females in the prey assemblage (e.g.,
Weinstock, 2000), we obtained the best results from the distal
metatarsal and distal tibiae, which were numerous and wellpreserved.
The sample
The Quina Mousterian faunal assemblage from Level 22 at Jonzac contains a diversity of animals (Table 1). Reindeer are by far the
dominant species (80.7% of specimens identiﬁed to species or
family), and other ungulates include horse (Equus caballus) and
large bovid (likely Bison priscus). Wild ass (Equus hydruntinus) and
red deer (Cervus elaphus) are represented by just two and one

specimen, respectively. No large carnivores were found in Level 22,
and small mammals including fox (Vulpes vulpes or Alopex lagopus),
Arctic hare (Lepus timidus) and marmot (Marmota marmota) were
identiﬁed in low numbers. Long bone shafts as well as epiphyses
were identiﬁed to the lowest taxonomic level possible. We used
body size classes for ungulate remains that did not preserve any
features that allowed for further identiﬁcation. Rangifer falls within
our ‘Ungulate Size 2’ category, along with red deer (C. elaphus), wild
ass (E. hydruntinus), and ibex (Capra ibex). However, out of 9007
bones, only one red deer, two wild ass, and no ibex were identiﬁed
in the Level 22 assemblage. Therefore, we assume that the overwhelming majority of Size 2 and Cervidae bones belong to reindeer.
We have analyzed the Rangifer (n ¼ 1936), Size 2 (n ¼ 2293), and
Cervidae (n ¼ 65) assemblages together (NISP ¼ 4294).
The reindeer assemblage from Level 22 is well-preserved overall. The majority (73.4%) of the faunal remains retained >75% of
their cortical surfaces, which facilitated the recognition of modiﬁcations such as cut, percussion and carnivore tooth marks. Plotting
skeletal element frequencies from the Jonzac assemblage against
bone density values for Rangifer (Lam et al., 1999) shows only
a weak but signiﬁcant and positive relationship, which indicates
that density-mediated destruction may have played a role in which
parts were preserved (Fig. 3). However, some of the less robust
skeletal parts from the axial skeleton are still present, and many
delicate elements, such as fetal bones, hyoids, and costal cartilage
were still preserved in the assemblage. Higher MNE counts on
robust midshaft portions in comparison with the articular ends,
with the exception of radio-ulna, suggest that preservation of the
four upper long bones could have been affected by density (Fig. 2).
Our analysis indicates that carnivores played little role in the
accumulation or destruction of bone in Level 22. Few carnivore
remains are present, coprolites have not been found, and traces of
carnivore gnawing on bone are extremely rare (Table 2). Examples
of carnivore signatures include two reindeer ﬁrst phalanges
showing probable traces of digestion (etching by stomach acids)
and a thoracic vertebra spine fragment from a large bovid showing
tooth marks from wolf or hyaena. With regard to hominin/carnivore interactions, Airvaux’s excavations recovered a cut-marked
metatarsal from a cave lion (Beauval, 2004) and our recent
campaign identiﬁed cut marks on a fox tibia (Fig. 4), providing rare
examples of Neandertals butchering carnivores. Cut marks are
located on the articular portion of the distal tibia, which are associated with disarticulation of the hindlimb from the foot and
perhaps the process of skinning as well (e.g., Mallye, 2011).

Prey selection
Based on epiphyseal fusion of modern Rangifer (Spiess, 1979;
Hufthammer, 1995), we estimate that the majority of Jonzac reindeer were adults, primarily older than three years of age, with
fewer juvenile specimens present (Table 3). Deciduous and adult
teeth are well-represented in the sample, and like the epiphyseal
fusion data, they indicate that while all ages of reindeer were
hunted, the majority were adult animals. Lower right deciduous
and adult fourth premolars provide the largest sample (MNI ¼ 18)
for reconstructing the age distribution of reindeer. In Rangifer, the
lower deciduous fourth premolar is usually replaced by the adult
fourth premolar between 22 and 27 months of age, although
replacement can be as early as 17 months (Miller, 1974). Of the 18
teeth, four lower right deciduous specimens are present, representing a juvenile abundance of 22%; 11 lightly worn lower right
fourth premolars represent 61% prime-aged animals, and three
heavily worn lower right fourth premolars indicate 17% old individuals (Fig. 5). These results agree with the fusion data, indicating
that the majority of animals were adults. Juveniles may be underrepresented because of their less dense bones and teeth, and
therefore our results could be consistent with non-selective
hunting. However, our results do demonstrate that the Quina
Mousterian Neandertals of Jonzac could consistently hunt primeaged reindeer.
Modern caribou and reindeer are sexually dimorphic, and adult
males are noticeably larger than females. Based on osteometric
measurements taken on fully fused adult distal tibiae and metatarsals (following von den Driesch, 1976), the Jonzac reindeer show
a range of variation in size, and some clustering indicates that
males and females are present (Fig. 6). The tibiae suggest a ratio of
six females to nine males, while the metatarsals suggest at least

There is a weak but signiﬁcant relationship, indicating some bias in our sample.
However, some delicate pieces such as fetal bones, hyoids, and costal cartilage are
preserved.

Additional cut marks evident along the tibia shaft suggest the
removal of meat, and the shaft shows evidence of being broken
while fresh. Cut-marked fox bones indicating skinning are found in
Upper Paleolithic sites in Eurasia (e.g., Wojtal et al., 2005; Soulier
and Mallye, 2012), and the skeletal part representation of fox in
many Upper Paleolithic sites suggests that they were exploited for
their fur (Klein, 1973; Soffer, 1985). Remains of fox and other furbearing carnivores are relatively common in Middle Paleolithic
assemblages and may well have been hunted for their furs.
However, a lack of cut marks in these assemblages may suggest
instead that fox was part of the background fauna in most cases.

last increment is a slow growth deposit, indicating season of death
during the cold season. For the three other cases, a complete or
a near complete fast growth deposit ended the sequence, suggesting that the individuals died during the end of the warm season
or very early in the cold season. These results are consistent with
the mandible aged to three to six months by tooth eruption and
wear.
Overall, our combined age-at-death analyses indicate that
reindeer were hunted and butchered at Jonzac during multiple
seasons, coinciding with the reindeer’s fall migrations and
stretching into winter. Whether these seasonal indicators mean
that hominins did not occupy the site at other times of the year
cannot be answered until we obtain similar data from other prey
taxa at this site.

three females and one male. The assignments of the nine intermediate specimens are less clear. These results suggest that
Neandertals did not selectively hunt one sex of reindeer, which may
reﬂect the time-averaging of multiple hunts of sex-segregated
herds or hunting during the seasons when the herds were not
segregated.
Evaluating the eruption and wear of two mandibular specimens
from Level 22 allowed estimates of both age- and season-at-death.
A partial tooth row of a deciduous third and fourth premolar points
to death at three to six months (fall). A tooth row containing the
fourth premolar through the third molar, where the fourth
premolar is still erupting and not yet in occlusion, indicates an ageat-death of approximately 22 months (late winter to spring).
However, we should note that variation in dental eruption
increases with age and the younger individual likely provides
a more reliable seasonal estimate.
To further investigate seasonality, using relative age and side,
we established a minimum number of 12 individuals (based on
mandibular premolars and molars) that were suitable for
cementum increment analysis. Of these 12 teeth, most of the thin
sections exhibited well-preserved cementum, although some
weathering alteration could be seen on the material (Table 4).
Diagenetic alterations rendered three teeth unreadable. Of the good
samples, nine teeth yielded similar age-at-death estimates for the
Quina reindeer. In six cases among the Jonzac reindeer sample, the

Evaluation of skeletal element frequencies (Fig. 7 and Table 5)
indicate that complete or nearly complete reindeer skeletons were
transported to Jonzac from the kill site location for butchery and
processing. Right lateral malleoli provide almost the same MNI as
teeth and the MNE values for the anterior foramen of the femur and
lateral foramen of the tibia are equally high, further suggesting that
mostly complete animals, or at the very least complete limb units,
were once handled in the site. Vertebrae are poorly represented but
this could be due to taphonomic factors, because there is some
density-mediated attrition of the sample (Fig. 3). Ribs are present
but difﬁculties in quantifying this element resulted in their exclusion from the %MAU counts. Toes are infrequent overall, and they
decrease in abundance from the proximal to distal elements. This
pattern is common (Todd and Rapson, 1999) and is likely due to
taphonomic factors, not human transport or skinning and butchery
decisions, because bone density also decreases from proximal to
distal (Lam et al., 1999). Interestingly, carpals and tarsals are
frequent, and in some cases, nearly as frequent as the associated

long bones. This suggests that partial or complete limb packages
were transported to the site in an articulated state, as opposed to
the selective transport of limb portions or speciﬁc long bones.
Patellae are rare, which is surprising given the abundance of femora
and tibiae. This could be because of this bone’s low density or
because the patellae were removed during the process of
disarticulation.
Although less dense bones are less abundant in the assemblage,
we thought that it was still valuable to consider if skeletal element
abundance could also be related to the economic value of various
skeletal parts that were derived from modern Rangifer (Binford,
1978) for application to archaeological assemblages (Fig. 8).
Comparison of our data with overall standardized food utility
(meat, marrow, and bone grease; Metcalfe and Jones, 1988) shows
no statistically signiﬁcant correlation, though the higher frequencies of the nutritionally-rich elements like femora and tibia are still
noteworthy. In the Level 22 assemblage, the relationship between
skeletal element abundance and marrow cavity volume or oleic
acid content is not signiﬁcant either. This is surprising because
reindeer long bones have ample marrow cavities and the withinbone nutrients are easier to extract than in other ungulates such
as horse, whose marrow is integrated in trabecular spongy bone
(Outram and Rowley-Conwy, 1998; Enloe, 2003). Moreover, some
long bones of Rangifer are richer in unsaturated fatty acids that
make these elements an especially desirable food resource
(Binford, 1978; Morin, 2007).
Several elements were found in articulation including a distal
humerus and proximal radio-ulna set (Fig. 1C) and a complete
articulated set of carpals. These elements appear to have been
discarded together, with their connective tissue still intact. Since
there appears to have been little post-depositional disturbance in
the bonebed, this suggests rapid burial of the bones. These

articulated items are likely discarded waste material, since they are
elements without much food value. The density of faunal remains
in Level 22 suggests that an abundance of carcass remains were
discarded together at the site, and the thickness of the bonebed
suggests that this happened repeatedly.
Anthropogenic modiﬁcations and reindeer carcass processing
The Quina Mousterian reindeer from Jonzac show extensive
evidence of butchery (Table 2). A total of 22% of the bones preserve
cut marks, which are found on almost all of the skeletal elements.
Based on the location of the cut marks, they are indicative of
skinning, dismembering and deﬂeshing (Binford, 1981; Nilssen,
2000). If we look at cut marks just on the long bones, we see
consistent frequencies ranging between 20% and 27% across the
limbs (Fig. 9A). For comparison, the Jonzac cut mark data are
compared with the Quina reindeer assemblage from Pech de l’Azé
IV (Dordogne, France; Niven, in press), which shows much higher
frequencies of cut marks overall and great variability between limb
elements. This variation might reﬂect different carcass processing
strategies, such as meat removal on the upper limb elements or
factors such as carcass condition (e.g., supple versus stiff) and bone
morphology, which can inﬂuence the number of cut marks inﬂicted
(Egeland, 2003). The variation could also reﬂect differences in site
function, how many carcasses were butchered during each processing episode, or unexplainable differences (Lyman, 2005).
After butchery and deﬂeshing, the long bones were broken open
for marrow extraction. Some elements show longitudinal scraping
marks, presumably to remove the periosteum to facilitate breaking
the bone. Percussion marks are found on all of the marrow-rich
long bones and similar to what we see in the cut mark data,
there is also general consistency in percussion frequencies across

these elements (Fig. 9B). These numbers fall slightly below the 20e
50% range from experimental percussion marked assemblages
where humans were the only modiﬁer (Marean et al., 2000) but
correspond well with other archaeological assemblages, even those
lacking signiﬁcant carnivore contributions in which percussion
mark frequencies fall between 13% and 35% (summarized in Niven,
2007). Overall, the Jonzac percussion mark data do not indicate any
preference for speciﬁc elements based on factors such as nutritional quality of marrow (e.g., Binford, 1978; Speth, 1983; Morin,
2007). This is in contrast to the pattern seen in the percussion
frequencies of reindeer from the Quina level at Pech de l’Azé IV,
where greater variability is reﬂected in which bones were more
extensively exploited for marrow (Fig. 9B; Niven, in press).
In addition to percussion mark evidence, these limb elements
exhibit many green fractures, indicating that the bones were
broken while fresh. Overall, 55% of the reindeer bones have green
fractures. Long bones are heavily fragmented; one-quarter or less of
the shaft was preserved for 68% of the elements, and one-quarter to
one-half for 25%; less than 50% of the shaft circumference was
preserved for 82% of the long bones (following Bunn, 1983; Villa
and Mahieu, 1991).
Evidence for burning of reindeer bone is sparse, with only four
specimens showing this modiﬁcation. The lack of burnt bone, the
rarity of burnt lithics and absence of hearth features in Level 22
might indicate that ﬁre was not used on-site. However, since only
a small fraction of the Quina Mousterian deposits at Jonzac was
excavated thus far, our conclusions on the use of ﬁre in Level 22
must remain tentative. In a broader context, evidence for the use of
ﬁre in Quina sites overall is rare (Sandgathe et al., 2011a), despite
the fact that Neandertals were capable of using ﬁre and did so
frequently during the Mousterian (Roebroeks and Villa, 2011;
Sandgathe et al., 2011b).
Eighty-one reindeer specimens show evidence of having been
used to retouch or resharpen stone artifacts. These tools are
commonly referred to as retouchoirs (Chase, 1990; Armand and
Delagnes, 1998; Patou-Mathis, 2002; Verna and d’Errico, 2011).
These pieces typically show one or more clusters of localized short,
shallow percussion marks (Fig. 10) and experimental studies
support the function of these expedient tools (e.g., Armand and
Delagnes, 1998; Karavani
c and Sokec, 2003; Mallye et al., 2012).
In the Quina reindeer sample from Jonzac, the robust skeletal parts
such as limb shaft portions were most frequently used as retouchoirs; all of the pieces used, except for three, were long bone
fragments. The use of different skeletal parts is characteristic of
Middle Paleolithic retouchoir assemblages, such as at La Quina,
where Henri Martin recognized these tools’ function and documented them extensively as early as 1906 (e.g., Martin, 1906).

Discussion
In sum, our results suggest that during the Quina Mousterian,
Jonzac served as the primary butchering location for reindeer
hunting events that took place on a seasonal basis, i.e., fall and
winter. Of the 18 reindeer represented in the sample, males and
females of all ages were hunted, although prime-adults dominate.
Skeletal element frequencies reﬂect most major portions of the
reindeer having been transported to the site, perhaps as complete
carcasses. The recovery of in situ articulated limb portions as well
as the overall number of joint elements also supports this argument
or one in which articulated limb portions were selected for transport and subsequent processing for meat and within-bone nutrients. The elements preserve abundant butchery marks. Percussion
notches, the high proportion of green breaks, and the fragmentation of the assemblage attest to marrow extraction. The lack of
burning indicates that Neandertals were not using ﬁre for cooking.

(data not shown; Spearman’s rho ¼ 0.31, p ¼ 0.54).

The apparent lack of ﬁre in the Quina Mousterian at Jonzac, as
well as other Quina sites, is one of many factors supporting
a scenario in which Neandertals occupied sites for brief periods,
investing minimally in these sites in terms of space and structures
(e.g., ﬁre hearths). This speaks to groups being highly mobile,
a characteristic that is also reﬂected in the Quina toolkit comprised
of versatile items, including Quina scrapers, made on large blanks
and intended for long-term use and transport (Jaubert et al., 2001;
Hiscock et al., 2009). Neandertals have long been characterized as

press).

mobile hominins in general, in part because their higher nutritional
and energy requirements translate into more frequent moves
between sites and food patches (Macdonald et al., 2009). However,
the evidence we have from Quina Mousterian sites thus far suggests
that Neandertals from this time period show greater mobility
overall than Neandertals from other phases of the Mousterian (e.g.,
Costamagno et al., 2006; Delagnes and Rendu, 2011), though this
hypothesis needs to be tested with further examples.
At Jonzac, it appears that in addition to winter use by Neandertals, other visits coincided with the fall migrations of reindeer. A
recent study of strontium isotope ratios from several Quina reindeer individuals from the site showed that the Jonzac reindeer
migrated long distances on a seasonal basis similar to modern day
Rangifer and were hunted by Neandertals near this site somewhere
along their migration route (Britton et al., 2011). These occupations
may have taken place repeatedly throughout one season, one year
or over several years. Although the dense bonebed contains
numerous reindeer, we estimate that it represents multiple smallscale hunting episodes in fall and winter as opposed to two mass
seasonal kills.
Since reindeer would not have been available year-round, Quina
groups likely responded to ﬂuctuating food resources through
mobility and by hunting other ungulate prey that were present in

smaller numbers than reindeer, but were locally available and not
restricted by seasonal migrations. These include horse and bison,
both of which are present in the Quina faunas from Jonzac as well as
Les Pradelles/Marillac (Costamagno et al., 2006) and Pech de l’Azé
IV (Niven, in press). Strontium isotope studies of Pleistocene horses
and bison in Europe and North America indicate that neither
species was a long-distance migrant on the scale of Rangifer. For
example, these data show that in Pleistocene North America, bison
migrated seasonally in a ca. 50 km radius (Widga et al., 2010), while
horses tended to move locally with a maximum range of w150 km
(Hoppe and Koch, 2007). Strontium isotope data from
E. hydruntinus (European ass) indicated similarly residential
behavior for this species in Italy during the Late Pleistocene/Early
Holocene (Pellegrini et al., 2008). In addition, horses’ daily
requirements for drinking water would have meant they were
predictably located at water sources (Berger, 1986). If horse and
bison had comparable migratory behaviors in Pleistocene France,
these species may have supplemented the diets of Neandertals at
Jonzac either during seasons in which reindeer were not locally
available but when hominin groups nonetheless occupied the site
or alternatively, during the same occupations in which reindeer
were butchered here. However, these conclusions remain tentative,
since we are lacking season-of-death data from the bison and horse
from Jonzac. Moreover, we should not assume that these taxa
behaved similarly across time and in all locations until further
isotopic datasets are produced.
Despite the dominance of reindeer in the Quina Mousterian
fauna, we do not propose that this assemblage represents hunting
specialization on this prey taxon. The season-of-death estimates in
conjunction with strontium isotope data from the Level 22 reindeer
do point to the intentional, seasonal predation on Rangifer when
they were migrating through the area. However, this was
a response to what resources were available in the local environment (e.g., Grayson and Delpech, 2003, 2005; Discamps et al.,
2011). Single-species hunting specialization would imply that
other available prey taxa were intentionally excluded at the
expense of another (e.g., Mellars, 1996). Since reindeer appear to
have been one of the few large ungulates on the landscape during
cold periods and particularly abundant during speciﬁc times of the
year, we predict that Neandertals hunted them for lack of a better
choice. When other ungulates such as horse and bison were
encountered, they were also taken, either during reindeer seasons
or outside of them. Single-species hunting specialization might
have also involved planning for long-term solutions to nutritional
needs, including mass kills of ungulates whose meat can be stored
over the winter (Enloe, 1999). Such specialization, primarily on
reindeer, may be evident in the late Upper Paleolithic, but not
among Quina Neandertals. Instead, the hunting specialization of
Quina Neandertals was on large ungulates in general, depending on
their density and availability in the environment e a subsistence
strategy suited to small populations of highly mobile foragers (e.g.,
Kelly and Todd, 1988; Waguespack and Surovell, 2003).
Conclusions
The Quina Mousterian Neandertals occupying Jonzac were
large-game hunters that seasonally targeted reindeer and supplemented them with bison and horse. Multiple reindeer carcasses
were processed at the rockshelter, which likely was not too far from
the kill site. The high density and thickness of the bonebed indicates that the site was repeatedly used for this purpose and
consistently during the same seasons.
The Quina Mousterian offers a unique opportunity to explore
Neandertal adaptations during cold climatic conditions in Pleistocene Europe. From a small number of sites, including Jonzac in

633

southwestern France, we know that the Quina Mousterian is
frequently associated with reindeer-dominated faunas and a toolkit well-suited to mobile groups (Hiscock et al., 2009; Delagnes
and Rendu, 2011). We propose that the apparent lack of
evidence of ﬁre hearths or site structure at Quina sites such as
Jonzac reﬂects localities that were occupied for short periods as
opposed to longer duration habitation sites. Like the Quina
Mousterian levels of other sites, the Quina Mousterian of Jonzac
likely represents one stopping place among many for these mobile
hunter-gatherers. Short-term nutritional needs were fulﬁlled
through small-scale hunting of ungulates, especially reindeer that
were exploited extensively for their food resources. Ongoing
research on the zooarchaeology and stone tool technology at
several Quina Mousterian sites, including Les Pradelles/Marillac,
Roc de Marsal and Pech de l’Azé IV, will undoubtedly shed more
light on the Quina Neandertal niche.
