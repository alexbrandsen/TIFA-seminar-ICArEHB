The acquisition and consumption of small prey in the pre-Upper Palaeolithic is a highly debated topic at
present. For some authors, the systematic obtaining of these animals is only part of the subsistence
strategies used by anatomically modern Humans. However, the consumption of small prey dates back to
the Plio-Pleistocene chronologies in some sites. Although the utilization of leporids has been recorded in
several pre-Late Pleistocene European sites, the evidence of tortoise consumption is documented not as
common for these periods. However, Level IV of Bolomor Cave has clear diagnostic elements to document
the acquisition and use of tortoises (Testudo hermanni) for food in the form of: (1) cutmarks on limb
bones and ventral surface of the carapace and plastron; (2) presence of burning on tortoise skeleton and
shell; (3) elements of anthropogenic breakage on carapace and plastron: percussion pits, percussion
notches and impact ﬂakes; and (4) human toothmarks on limb bones. This paper tries to examine the
possible patterns in the tortoise consumption sequence from Level IV of Bolomor Cave and improves data
on the butchery process and tortoise consumption in the Late Middle Pleistocene.

1. Introduction
The acquisition and consumption of small prey in the pre-Upper
Palaeolithic times is strongly debated in Europe (Brugal and Desse,
2004). Several researchers state that the systematic use of
resources offered by very small-sized animals is limited to the
Upper Palaeolithic (Isaac and Crader, 1981; Villaverde et al., 1996;
Pérez Ripoll, 2001; Martı́nez Valle, 2001a; Aura et al., 2002; Lupo
and Schmitt, 2002; Hockett and Haws, 2002; Cochard and Brugal,
2004). For these authors, this subsistence strategy is exclusively
linked to anatomically modern Humans. However, there are some
sites of Plio-Pleistocene chronologies, such as Bed I at Olduvai
(Tanzania), in which the occasional use of hedgehogs (Erinaceus
broomi) has been suggested (Fernández-Jalvo et al., 1999). Incisions
on rabbit bones have also been documented in the Lower Pleistocene at Sima del Elefante in Atapuerca (Spain) (Huguet, 2007). Also
in more recent chronologies, around 400 Ky, cutmarks on the
leporids remains exist at Level G of Caune de l’Arago in France
(Costamagno and Laroulandie, 2004). Evidence for consistent
consumption of small prey has also been observed at Grotte de
Lazaret site with dating readings around MIS 6 (Jullien and Pillard,
1969) and at the MIS 4 Crouzade site (Costamagno and Laroulandie,

2004). Examples illustrating the use of tortoises have been found in
the Middle Palaeolithic levels of Quesem Cave (Stiner, 2007),
Kebara Cave (Speth and Tchernov, 2002) and Hayonim Cave in
Israel (Stiner, 2005) and at the Mousterian sites of Grotta Breuil and
Moscerini in Italy (Stiner, 1994; Stiner et al., 2000). They are common in Middle Stone Age sites in South Africa, such as Blombos
Cave (Henshilwood et al., 2001), Die Kelders Cave (Klein and CruzUribe, 2000), Ysterfontein Rock Shelter and Diepkloof Rock Shelter
(Halkett et al., 2003) and at Later Stone Age sites, such as Byneskranskop Cave 1 (Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1983), Eland’s Bay Cave
(Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1987), Duneﬁeld Midden (Parkington et al.,
1992), Geelbek (Avery et al., 2004) and Haaskraal Shelter (Sampson,
1998). In Spain, sporadic consumption of lagomorphs at Middle
Palaeolithic sites has also been documented, for example, as in
Gabasa I (Huesca, Spain) (Blasco Sancho, 1995) and cutmarks on
one tortoise plastron in the Cueva de los Torrejones (Guadalajara,
Spain) (Arribas et al., 1997). However, in Bolomor Cave, the consumption of small prey is common throughout the entire stratigraphic sequence. At this site, the appearance of anthropogenic
processing marks on Oryctolagus cuniculus is recorded repeatedly
from 400 to 120 Ky (Blasco, 2006). In particular, in Level IV this
access to small-sized animals for consumption has not only been
documented in rabbits, but also in birds and tortoises. From this
perspective, the aim of this paper is to improve data on the tortoise
processing from Level IV of Bolomor Cave and to examine possible
patterns in their consumption sequence.

2. Bolomor Cave
Bolomor Cave is located on the southern slope of the Valldigna
valley, approximately 2 km south-east of the town of Tavernes
(Valencia, Spain) (Fig. 1). The cave is situated on the right bank of
the Bolomor Ravine, approximately 100 m above sea level. Northeast of the site, the coast runs almost perpendicular to the valley,
the base of which, along which the Vaca River runs, is almost at sea
level.
The sedimentary sequence of Bolomor Cave consists mainly of
allochthonous material of colluvial origin that has been deposited
via open channels on walls and ceiling. In addition to these deposits
there are other autochthonous sediments of gravitational origin
from the zenith subsidence, due to tectonics or weathering processes. Seventeen geoarchaeological levels have been identiﬁed

(Fumanal, 1995). Level IV consists of a sandy sediment with
limestone clasts.
The karstic deposit of Bolomor Cave has been dated by Amino
Acid Racemization (AR) and Thermoluminescence (TL) to between
MIS 9 and MIS 5e (Fernández Peris, 2001, 2006). Several TL dates
have been obtained: 121 18 Ky for Level II, and 233  35 Ky and
225  34 Ky for Level XIII. AR dates have also been made:
228  53 Ky for Level XIII and 525  125 Ky for Level XVII (Fig. 2).
At present, the lithic industry recovered from Bolomor Cave is
classiﬁed as a Middle Palaeolithic techno-complex. All the stages of
the chaine operatoire are represented. The raw materials used
consist of ﬂint, limestone and quartzite, which come from marine,
colluvial and ﬂuvial stones from the immediate area around the site
and from areas further aﬁeld up to 15 km from the site. The Level IV
industry consists mainly of small tools, predominantly scrapers,

denticulates and variously retouched pieces. The tools have
a strong pattern of reuse (Fernández Peris, 2006).
The faunal from Bolomor Cave includes 20 species of macromammals. The biostratigraphic sequence is particularly characterized by the presence of Hemitragus sp., Equus ferus, Cervus elaphus
and Dama sp. and by a more speciﬁc record at certain times of other
species such as Megaloceros giganteus, Sus scrofa, Macaca sylvana,
Equus hydruntinus, Bos primigenius, Stephanorhinus hemitoechus,
Paleoloxodon antiquus, Hippopotamus amphibius and Castor ﬁber.
The presence of carnivores in the cave is sporadic, however, fossil
remains of Ursus arctos, Ursus tibetanus, Canis lupus, Panthera leo,
Lynx pardina, Vulpes vulpes and Meles meles have been identiﬁed
(Martı́nez Valle, 2001b; Blasco, 2006; Sarrión and Fernández Peris,
2006; Blasco et al., 2008). The faunal from Level IV includes 16
species of macromammals and among these, C. elaphus and B.
primigenius are many.
The investigations carried out to date at the site have yielded the
remains of anthropogenic combustion structures in Levels II, IV, XI
and XIII. For this last level, there is a dating via AR on malacofauna
which gives a date of 228  53 Ky. Therefore, at Bolomor Cave there

is the oldest recorded evidence for the controlled use of ﬁre on the
Iberian Peninsula.
Human fossils have been recovered from Bolomor Cave: seven
bone and dental fragments. According to Arsuaga et al. (2001), the
morphology of the human remains from Bolomor Cave is
compatible with that of the European human fossils of the Middle
Pleistocene.
3. Methodology
The faunal analysis of Level IV of Bolomor Cave has been carried
out following a zooarchaeological methodology and includes the
study of all the fossil tortoise remains recovered. The data was
obtained from the anatomical and taxonomical analysis and from
the structural modiﬁcations of the bones.
The tortoise remains have been anatomically classiﬁed (Fig. 3).
NISP (Number of Identiﬁed Specimens), MNE (Minimum Number of
Elements), MNI (Minimum Number of Individuals) and skeletal
survival rate (Brain, 1981; Lyman, 1994) have been calculated. MNE
was calculated taking into account age, portion and size. Skeletal

survival rate gauges the proportion between the elements
recovered and those expected (Brain, 1969). For calculation of this,
the following formula was used: %Survivali ¼ MNE  100/number
of elementi in the animal skeleton  MNI.
Surface alterations generated by the hominids and carnivores
were treated at both macroscopic and microscopic level. For
microscopic study an Olympus Europe SZ11 (magniﬁcation up to
1100) and SEM (Jeol JSM 6400) were used. Damage observed in
the tortoise remains included cutmarks, bone breakage, burning
and human toothmarks. Two types of cutmarks were identiﬁed
and grouped into incisions and scrapes (Binford, 1981; Potts and
Shipman, 1981; Shipman, 1983; Shipman and Rose, 1983; Shipman
et al., 1984). The incisions are striations with a linear outline of
variable length, width, and depth. The incisions have a V-shaped
section and display internal microstriation (Potts and Shipman,
1981). In some cases Hertzian cones (Bromage and Boyde, 1984),
shoulder effects and barbs (Shipman and Rose, 1983) were found.
The scrape marks are shallow sub-parallel cutmarks (Noe-Nygaard,
1989) caused when a stone tool is dragged transversally along the
length of the bone. The analysis of cutmarks took into account the
number of striations, location on the anatomical element,
distribution over the surface (isolated, clustered, crossed) and
orientation regarding the longitudinal axis of the bone (oblique,
longitudinal, transverse). Maximum and minimum length was
taken in millimetres.

Surface damage caused during the breakage of the bones was
also analyzed and the diagnostic elements of anthropic breakage
were documented: percussion pits or percussion marks
(Blumenschine and Selvaggio, 1988; Pickering and Egeland, 2006),
percussion notches and impact ﬂakes (Capaldo and Blumenschine,
1994; Pickering and Egeland, 2006). Percussion marks refer to pits
and striae. Diagnostic morphology and conﬁguration of percussion
pits and striations are described and illustrated by Turner (1983)
and Blumenschine and Selvaggio (1988). Pits are often closely
associated with and/or have emanating from them the patches of
striae that result from slippage of stone against bone during impact
events. Percussion notches are semicircular shaped indentations on
fracture edges with corresponding negative ﬂake scars. Impact
ﬂakes refer to shaft fragments produced by hammerstone percussion that display the same basic technical attributes of percussion
as it occurs on stone ﬂakes.
The burning has also been identiﬁed on tortoise remains. The
bones brought to the ﬁre experience different modiﬁcations: colour
changes, cracking or fractures and shrinkage (Shipman et al., 1984;
Guillon, 1986; Buikstra and Swegle, 1989; Nicholson, 1993; inter
alia). Perhaps, the most obvious alteration is the changing natural
coloration of the bones. The colour acquired by skeletal remains
depends on the intensity of temperature received and the exposure
time supported. During exposure to burning skeletal and dental
remains progress through different colour stages (mainly from

brown, black, grey and to white) (Correia, 1997). The colour changes
reﬂect different responses to heat offered by the organic and
inorganic components of the bones to the increase in temperature.
The alterations are here arranged in 6 degree clusters according to
colour (Stiner et al., 1995; Cáceres, 2002):
- Grade 0: unburned bones
- Grade 1: the bone surface presents small dots scattered brown.
- Grade 2: brown stain more or less homogeneous across the
bone surface.
- Grade 3: the bone was charred. The colour is black.
- Grade 4: grey stain. Occasionally veins appear with bluish
tones.
- Grade 5: the fossil appears calcined. The colour is completely
white.
4. Data presentation
Level IV of Bolomor Cave provided 526 tortoise remains
(Testudo hermanni) (Table 1). The MNE is 131, mostly represented
by humeri (36) and femurs (28) while ulnas are only represented
by one bone. The MNI is 19, established from the most common
skeletal element (humerus) according to its location in the tortoise
skeleton and its size. The skeletal survival rate assesses the proportion between the elements recovered and those you would
expect according to the MNI. This way, the anatomical representation obtained is deemed more valid as an indicator of the

elements, which are absent from the sample. Results demonstrate
whether biases are present. According to this rate, a biased skeletal representation is observed. The anatomical elements with the
highest survival are humeri (94.73%), femurs (73.69%) and plastron
(68.42%) (Table 2).
The majority of the alterations observed on these tortoise
remains are anthropogenic in origin. The relatively high occurrence
of cutmarks on tortoise bones (9.3%) indicates an association
between the hominids and tortoises. These have been identiﬁed
mainly in the carapace (28) with a predominance of the incisions
and scrapes on ventral surface of the costal shield. Cutmarks have
also been identiﬁed on humeri (6), femur (2), tibia (1), ischium (2)
and ventral surface of plastron (10) (Table 3) (Fig. 4). The action
performed (viscera removal, disarticulation and deﬂeshing) has
been recorded according to morphology, emplacement and distribution of anthropogenic incisions.
Surface damage caused during breakage of the bones has also
been analyzed. Three diagnostic elements of anthropic fracturing
have been documented: percussion pits or percussion marks (3),
percussion notches (2) and impact ﬂakes (8) (Fig. 5). Two percussion pits and two percussion notches have been located on carapace
(neural bone) and one percussion mark on plastron (hypoplastron).
Impact ﬂakes of the shell have been identiﬁed and situated in
neural (2) and costal bones (3). Three impact ﬂakes have also been
located in hypoplastron.
The incidence of burning has been identiﬁed in 63.31% of tortoise remains (Table 4). All the skeletal parts have this modiﬁcation.
The carapace is the element most affected (190 bone fragments).
Grade 2 (brown colour) is the most abundant modiﬁcation type.
Two hundred and ten tortoises’ remains have been classiﬁed with
Grade 2. By contrast, Grade 4 is the worst represented.
Double coloration has also been observed in 12.1% of the burned
remains (Fig. 6). This is mainly documented on carapace (70.1%) and
does not coincide with the coloration described by Bennett (1999)
for bones burned after burial. At Bolomor Cave, a high degree of
burning, homogenous coloration and no surface deformation was
observed. In addition, the archeostratigraphic distribution of
burned tortoise remains indicates that there are no elements
located below the hearth recovered at Level IV.
The toothmarks identiﬁed on tortoise remains at Bolomor Cave
are concordant with the human toothmarks described by several
authors (Jones, 1983; White, 1992; Pickering and Wallis, 1997; Pérez
Ripoll, 2005; Lupo and Schmitt, 2005; Cáceres et al., 2007). These
marks are small in size, they usually appear near to broken

edges and are often associated with peeling. This association
(toothmarks-peeling) might consist of holding the skeletal element
between the teeth and bending it using the hands as a result of
meat consumption. Human toothmarks have been observed mainly
on limb bones (Table 5; Fig. 7).
No carnivore toothmarks were observed on the tortoise
remains. Neither the tortoise anatomical remains coincide with
those described by Sampson (2000) for raptors accumulations.

5. Discussion
The Testudo hermanni remains identiﬁed at Level IV of Bolomor
Cave present sufﬁcient evidence to attribute their presence to
human activity.
First, there was no evidence of carnivore damage in the form of
gnawing, pitting, scoring, or punctures on the tortoise remains, and
none of the bones show signs of having passed through the gut of
a predator. Second, the skeletal survival rate of Level IV tortoises
coincides with the one described by Sampson (2000) for Bushman
in the semi-arid Karoo of South Africa: absence of skulls, low representation of vertebrae and zygopodials (radius, ulna and tibia)
and abundance of stylopodials (humerus and femurs) and of shells.
Third, analysis of Level IV of Bolomor Cave illustrates clear evidence
that documents the acquisition and use of tortoises for food: (1)
cutmarks on limb bones and ventral surfaces of the carapace and
plastron; (2) the presence of burning on tortoise skeleton; (3)
elements of anthropogenic breakage on carapace and plastron
(percussion pits, percussion notches and impact ﬂakes); and (4)
human toothmarks on limb bones.
All of these elements have enabled us to reconstruct the consumption sequence of these animals.

Ascertaining the method of obtaining these animals is a complex matter. Isaac and Crader (1981) consider that acquiring small
prey is closer to gathering than hunting. On the other hand, Stiner
et al. (2000) and Stiner (2001) distinguish between slow-moving
easy collected types (mostly tortoises and shellﬁsh), fast-running
mammals (mostly lagomorphs) and quick-ﬂying game (birds). The
capture of fast-running and quick-ﬂying small prey requires
a sophisticated technology, while the slow-moving small animals
are essentially gatherable or captured with limited technology.
Hermann’s tortoise is relatively easy to catch: it is slow moving and
not aggressive. Therefore, obtaining these species does not require
much effort and involves no risks. However, ethnographic examples exist and explain how some groups of hunter-gatherers use
complex systems to hunt tortoises. Felger et al. (1981) carried out
studies on the Seri Indians of the north of Mexico and they describe
how tortoises are lured out of burrows with water placed at the
entrance or are sometimes dragged out of their burrows with long
hooks. At present, with the archaeological data available we cannot
know the technique used by the human groups to obtain these
reptiles.
It is obvious that in order to consume these animals, the carapace or plastron must be fractured. At Level IV of Bolomor Cave,
percussion marks, percussion notches and impact ﬂakes have
been identiﬁed, which indicate that the shell was fractured from
both the carapace and from the plastron. According to the data
obtained, the impacts were produced on the: (1) hypoplastron
and (2) neural and costal bones of the carapace. With the elements available, two fracturing techniques can be suggested: (1)
active or thrown percussion and (2) passive or direct percussion
(Giusberti and Peretto, 1991; Anconetani, 1999). Active or thrown
percussion is produced when the carapace/plastron is hit directly
against an object (stone) and passive or direct percussion is

caused when the carapace/plastron is held on the ground or on an
object that acts as an anvil and is hit with an instrument generally
made of stone.
The cutmarks identiﬁed on the tortoise remains indicate that
after breakage, they were processed to be consumed. The location
of the incisions on the bone remains enable us to reconstruct how
they were butchered. The cutmarks located on the limb bones show
that the action carried out is the deﬂeshing and those located on
the ventral surface of the carapace show the visceral removal. The
fact that scrapes predominate on the carapace could be due to that
after the extraction of the main visceral mass, in some areas the
eatable tissue could remain still adhered to the plates. Rybczynski
et al. (1996) also identiﬁed cutmarks related with the visceral and
meat removal on tortoise axial elements (carapace and plastron) at
a modern camp (Site 20) located on the eastern shore of Lake
Turkana.
At Level IV of Bolomor Cave, the percentage of cutmarks on the
tortoise remains is relatively high (9.3%). The absence of the
incisions in the 90.7% of the bones can be explained by different
reasons: (1) in the case of the carapace, it is possible that hands
were used for most of the process to extract the internal organs; (2)
it must be taken into account that when visceral or meat removal is
carried out, the lithic tool does not always come into contact with
the bone; and (3) the size of the prey makes use of tools
unnecessary for the consumption of the limb bones. The direct use
of the teeth would be the best way to remove the meat and fat from

the bones. The proof of this are the human toothmarks observed on
some bones.
Most of the tortoise remains show signs of burning. This enables
us to consider two options: (1) the tortoises are subjected to the
exposure to ﬁre before consumption (tortoises cooked) or; (2) the
bones are thrown onto the ﬁre once the meat and viscera have been
removed.
In order to tackle this problem, we must take into account the
degree of burning on the different skeletal elements. If the Testudo
hermanni were subjected to exposure to ﬁre before consumption,
the carapaces and the plastrons would be the parts most affected by
ﬁre. These skeletal elements would also show a greater degree of
burning on the dorsal surface and less on the ventral surface. The
rest of the skeleton would hardly be burned.
On the other hand, if the tortoise remains were thrown on the
ﬁre after consumption, most of the skeletal elements would reach
very high degrees of burning on many different body parts (degree
4 and 5). Many of them would experience cracking or fractures,
reduction in size and the most fragile and porous bones would be
destroyed (Shipman et al., 1984; Guillon, 1986; Buikstra and
Swegle, 1989; Nicholson, 1993; inter alia). In addition, it is possible
that not all bones and shells were thrown into the ﬁre, and therefore, the percentage of non-burned remains should also be taken
into account.
At Level IV of Bolomor Cave it can be observed that the carapace (65.97%) and the plastron (62.61%) remains are the most

R. Blasco / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 2839–2848

affected by ﬁre and among these, the carapaces show a greater
degree of burning on the dorsal surface than on the ventral
surface in 84.61% of the cases. The plastrons display a slightly
lower percentage (63.64%). On the other hand, grades 4 and 5 are
practically non-existent in the assemblage (2.1%). All of this data
is concordant with cooking of tortoises before consumption. The
percentages obtained from double colorations indicate that
the tortoise could be placed into the ﬁre upside down, which is
the common pattern described ethnographically. Werner (1990)
describes this practice for the slaughter of tortoises by the Kayapó
of Central Brazil. Several researchers have characterized patterned burning on the dorsal side of carapace elements, through
turning the animal upside down and roasting it in its shell, as
a distinguishing feature of human consumption (Flannery and
Wheeler, 1986; Sampson, 1998; Speth and Tchernov, 2002; Stahl
and Oyuela-Caycedo, 2007).
However, we must take into account that despite this dominance of characteristics in general, there is a certain percentage of
carapace that show a greater degree of burning on the ventral
surface than on the dorsal surface (15.29%), of burned limb bones
(57.72%) and of shells that are not burned (34.98%). These characteristics allow other possibilities to be proposed: (1) exposure to
heat prior to consumption combined with the action of throwing
some remains into the ﬁre (this would explain the burned limb
bones and the greater degrees of burning on the ventral sides) and
(2) without being exposed to heat, some tortoise remains would be
thrown into the ﬁre after consumption (this would explain the
absence of burning on some carapaces and plastrons, the greater
degree of burning on the ventral surfaces and the burned limb
bones).
Although the variability is to be expected, the burning damages
on tortoise bones show a nice pattern of processing. The Level IV
human groups of Bolomor Cave cooked the tortoises prior to their
consumption according to the models described ethnographically.
Less frequently, Testudo hermanni were processed without any
exposure to heat. Once the tortoises were consumed, some of their
bones were thrown into the ﬁre.

6. Conclusions
Level IV of Bolomor Cave has provided sufﬁcient evidence to
show proof of human consumption of tortoises in Later Middle
Pleistocene. The use of tortoises for food appears to be quite common among the hominids that occupied the cave at Level IV.
Although some exceptions do exist, these human groups follow
speciﬁc patterns to process the tortoises. These patterns have been
observed in the systematic use of ﬁre to consume the nutrients
from these animals. Thus, the consumption sequence of these small
prey starts with them being cooked. Habitually, the tortoises are
placed into the ﬁre upside down and are roasted in its shell. For
accessing to the internal nutrients, the shell was fractured from
both the carapace (neural and costal bones) and from the plastron
(hypoplastron). The cutmarks and human toothmarks identiﬁed on
the tortoise remains indicate that after breakage, they were
deﬂeshed to be consumed. All of these characteristics indicate that
the human groups of Bolomor Cave Level IV make intensive use of
these small prey.
In other levels of the stratigraphic sequence of the same cave,
the exploitation of small animals like leporids (Oryctolagus
cuniculus) and birds (Cygnus olor) is also documented (Blasco,
2006). In the future, it is possible that the stratigraphical sequence
of Bolomor Cave will provide enough data to compare the quick/
slow small prey incidence in the human groups’ palaeodiet during
the Middle Pleistocene and to discuss if this recurrence on small
game species is the result of a systematic process.
