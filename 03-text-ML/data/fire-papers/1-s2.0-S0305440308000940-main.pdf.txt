We assess the potential of X-ray microtomography as a tool for the non-destructive, three-dimensional
examination of the internal structure of charcoal. Microtomographic analysis of a series of charcoals
produced by the experimental pyrolysis of pine wood at temperatures from 300 and 600  C in nitrogen
only and in nitrogen mixed with 2% oxygen indicates that, despite substantial shrinkage, observed
porosity, pore size and pore connectivity are all increased by pyrolysis and also by chemical oxidation.
Analysis of a number of altered and unaltered archaeological and geological charcoals has demonstrated
the capacity of the technique to identify and map the distribution of authigenic mineral contamination
within charcoal fragments. The results are of signiﬁcance to radiocarbon dating in that they provide
insights into the mechanisms by which charcoal can be contaminated by extraneous carbon in the
natural environment.

1. Introduction
Charcoal is produced by the pyrolysis of biomass under conditions of limited oxygen availability (Chaloner, 1989; Scott, 2000).
This material, known as fusain in the fossil record (Scott, 1989) and
as inertinite by coal petrographers (Scott and Glasspool, 2007),
typically comprises 60–90% carbon, a proportion of which exists in
condensed aromatic molecular conﬁgurations (Forbes et al., 2006;
Eckmeier et al., 2007). Charcoal often retains much of the original
plant macrostructure, enabling identiﬁcation of the species or
genus that was pyrolysed (Scott, 2000, 2001; Emery-Barbier and
Thiebault, 2005; Marguerie and Hunot, 2007).
Charcoal represents one of the most widely used materials for
radiocarbon dating (Bird, 2006), and a key factor limiting the ability
to obtain robust radiocarbon dates from charcoal is the potential for
post-depositional contamination by extraneous carbon. At least
some components of charcoal appear to be largely ‘inert’ (Scott and
Glasspool, 2007), based on a high degree of resistance to a range of
oxidants (Bird and Gröcke, 1997; Wolbach and Anders, 1989;
Skjemstad et al., 1996) and the persistence of some charcoals for

long periods of time in the geologic record (Cope and Chaloner,
1980; Scott, 2000, 2008). However, mass balance studies of charcoal in both tropical and boreal soils have indicated that charcoal
can be progressively lost from the soil (e.g. Bird et al., 1999b). The
mechanisms postulated for this include photo-oxidation, inorganic
chemical or biologically mediated oxidation possibly coupled with
physical commutation to ﬁner particle sizes and translocation
(Skjemstad et al., 1996; Bird et al., 1999b, Czimczik et al., 2005).
It has been demonstrated that charcoal can interact in several
ways with its local depositional environment, having a beneﬁcial
effect upon soil microbial communities through the provision of
microhabitats (Wardle et al., 1998; Zackrisson et al., 1996;
Pietikäinen et al., 2000; Warnock et al., 2007), improving soil
nutrient retention capacity and sorbing a range of chemical contaminants (Cornelissen et al., 2004; James et al., 2005; Keech et al.,
2005). These observations suggest that charcoal is unlikely to be
a fully closed system in most depositional environments. Potential
sources of post-depositional extraneous carbon therefore include:
the reaction of organic compounds in soil solutions with the
charcoal surface, the passive microbial or fungal colonization of
pore spaces and possibly the active use of some charcoal components by these organisms as a metabolic substrate.
One key to evaluating the potential for interaction between
a charcoal fragment and its local depositional environment is the
internal physical structure of the material. Porosity, pore size and
the connectivity of available pore space are likely to exert

M.I. Bird et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 35 (2008) 2698–2706

2699

signiﬁcant control on the ability of soil solutions to diffuse through
the charcoal and of soil microbiota to colonize the charcoal. While
the primary control on charcoal structure is the nature of the
material pyrolysed, it is likely that pyrolysis conditions will also
exert signiﬁcant control on charcoal structure (Pietikäinen et al.,
2000; Cornelissen et al., 2004). Optical examination of polished
sections of charcoal and scanning electron microscopy of charcoal
fragments can provide some information on charcoal structure and
these techniques are routinely used in charcoal taxonomy (e.g.
Collinson et al., 2007). Nitrogen adsorption/desorption (László
et al., 2005) and mercury porosimetry (Klose and Schinkel, 2002)
techniques can also provide information on porosity and pore size
distribution. However, none of these techniques provide threedimensional information on charcoal structure and particularly
information on the degree to which pore space is connected
throughout a charcoal fragment.
Computerized reconstructions of serial sections of anatomically
preserved plants have proved successful in the study and identiﬁcation of plant fossils (Smith and Stockey, 2007), however, this
technique is inherently destructive. Phase contrast synchrotron
X-ray computerized microtomography has been shown to yield
detailed internal anatomy of charcoal, but currently this technique
is applicable only to specimens 1–2 mm in size (Friis et al., 2007).
X-ray microtomography employs the same principles as medical
CAT-scanning to generate a three-dimensional virtual image of
opaque materials, and has previously found application in the study
of soil micromorphology (O’Donnell et al., 2007) and sedimentology (Appoloni et al., 2007). This study explores the potential of this
technique as a new tool that has not previously been utilized in the
study of charcoal. While microtomography can be readily used as
a non-destructive technique for charcoal taxonomy, we focus here
on its use as a tool for examining the effect of pyrolysis conditions
and chemical oxidation on the development of porosity and pore
space connectivity in laboratory-produced charcoal. We also assess
the potential of the technique for determining the distribution of
mineral contaminants in archaeological and geological charcoal.
2. Samples and methodology
Approximately 0.7 cm3 cubes were cut from the outer 15 rings
a sample of Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris), obtained from Tentsmuir
Forest, Fife, in November 2005. Charcoal was produced from this
material in a Carbolite controlled-atmosphere rotary furnace, with
the exact pyrolysis temperature monitored via a thermocouple
inserted into one of the wood cubes in each run. The furnace was
set to a heating rate of 10  C min1, and then held at either 300 or
600  C for 60 min (hereafter referred to as PC300 and PC600).
These temperatures span a range that is representative of natural
ﬁres (e.g. Swift et al., 1993; Scott, 1989, 2000), and over which
signiﬁcant changes in charcoal chemical structure have been
observed (Williams and Besler, 1996; Scott and Glasspool, 2007;
McParland et al., 2007). The furnace was continuously ﬂushed
during each run with either nitrogen, or nitrogen mixed with 2% O2,
at a constant metered ﬂow rate of 7 l/min1 to purge volatilised
material. After the pyrolysis interval was complete, the samples
were allowed to cool to room temperature (20  C) under the same
gas ﬂow, and the mass loss of the sample was determined by
comparison of the pre- and post-pyrolysis sample weights. The
dimensions and mass of 10 cubes each of wood, and charcoal
produced under N2 at 300  and 600  C were averaged to obtain the
average volume and density of these materials. This procedure was
not performed for the other samples due to an irregular degree of
oxidative loss of the outer surfaces of the samples, which made
accurate determination of volume difﬁcult.
Single cubes of charcoal produced at 300 and 600  C were further subjected to oxidation in acidiﬁed potassium dichromate

solution (0.1 M K2Cr2O7 in 2 M H2SO4) for 72 h at 60  C, following
the protocol used for isolating ‘oxidation resistant elemental carbon’ (Bird and Gröcke, 1997) and for ABOX (acid-base oxidation)
pre-treatment for radiocarbon dating of charcoal (Bird et al., 1999a).
The total volume of the ﬁnal pyrolysed cubes ranged from 50 to
600 mm3, generally decreasing in size with increasing pyrolysis
temperature and/or purge gas oxygen content.
Three ancient charcoals were also selected for analysis. One
sample of charcoal (fusain) of Jusassic age from the Moor Grit
member of the Scalby Formation south of Cromer Point, Yorkshire,
England (Leeder and Nami, 1979; NGR TA030940, see Scott (1989))
was investigated to determine the distribution of diagenetic mineralization through the sample. X-ray diffraction indicates that the
major mineral phase in the sample is pyrite, with a variable degree
of surface oxidation to an unidentiﬁed, probably sulphate phase.
The sample is gymnospermous, having tracheids only, and hence is
comparable in characteristics to the Scots pine samples.
Two samples of charcoal were selected from the Nauwalabila I
archaeological site in northern Australia (Jones and Johnson, 1985),

a site where radiocarbon dating of charcoal samples from depth in
the deposit has proved problematic, and previous electron microprobe work has identiﬁed iron irregularly distributed through some
samples (Bird et al., 2002). Sample NLB L29 66 represents a relatively unaltered, black, vitreous charcoal sample from 2.3 m depth
with some loosely cemented sand-sized material adhering to the
outer surface, while sample NLB K29 57 represents an apparently
altered charcoal from 1.95 m depth with some black vitreous areas
but also reddish iron oxide rich patches. XRD indicated that the
main mineral phases in the sample are kaolinite, goethite and
quartz. In neither case is the species that produced the charcoal
known, and the irregular shape of the natural charcoals precluded
exact determination of volume, but all specimens had a total
volume between 500 and 1000 mm3.
The internal 3D structure of the samples was captured using
a high-resolution tomography (mCT) X-ray scanner (Xtek Ltd). mCT
systems are similar to medical X-ray tomography systems, whilst
operating at higher energies, longer exposure times, and at significantly higher spatial resolutions. Preliminary experiments were
conducted to ﬁnd the optimal scanning conditions: 80 keV and
266 mA. Each 3D volume consisted of typically a1 GB dataset comprising of 3600 scans with an incremental angle of 0.1. Volumes

were post-processed for visualization at a resolution of 21 mm using
VGStudiomax Version 1.2 (Volume Graphics).
Whilst mCT systems have the obvious advantages of accessibility,
increased resolution and non-destructive analysis of opaque
materials, they also have signiﬁcant limitations. First, unlike synchrotron-based tomography systems, mCT systems rely on polychromatic X-rays which can lead to image artefacts (beam
hardening). Second, there is always a compromise between the
volume scanned and the permitted spatial resolution: larger volumes lead to smaller resolutions. Whilst some mCT systems can
deliver 1 mm spatial resolution, this is only available with submillimetre samples sizes. For our largest sample size, 0.7 cm3, the
highest spatial resolution possible was 21 mm, and this resolution
was used for all scans. Thus, any objects (pores, walls) present at
scales below 21 mm, whilst present, would not be observed.
Another limitation, present in any procedure where image
processing is required, is the objective segmentation of objects of
different composition. In this case we required segmentation of
voids from surrounding charcoal material. In simple bicompositional materials such as engineered components, segmentation is relatively simple. The most difﬁcult material is soil
which typically is composed of a myriad of materials ranging from

Porosity (%)

PC refers to lab-produced pine charcoal. Volume and density were determined from the average of ten cubes for each treatment, with 1-sigma errors. Observed porosity was
determined from the average of ﬁve randomly selected volumes within each fragment, with the error quoted as deviation from the mean of the ﬁve determinations.

air, organics, through to silicate minerals; a mix that provides
a wide range of linear attenuation coefﬁcients that, in our mCT
systems, are converted into greyscales. For heterogenous materials
such as soil and our charcoal samples there is currently no available
objective thresholding technique that consistently and accurately
provides segmented voids and mineral components.
To aid in the important issue of thresholding we carried out
a sensitivity analysis of threshold value versus porosity. Threshold
was ultimately determined by visual inspection and comparison of
mCT images and binarised images.
For each sample, ﬁve rectangular volumes ranging from 5 to
50 mm3 composed of 70–200 individual image slices were randomly selected from within the total reconstructed sample volume.
After inspection of all images, a single threshold value of 40 on
a greyscale of 250 was chosen to delineate pore space (<40) from
charcoal matrix (>40), as discussed below. Based on this value,
porosity, pore size and pore connectivity were determined using
SCAMP software developed in-house at the University of Abertay.
Observed porosity is reported as the proportion of the total volume
identiﬁed as pore space at a greyscale threshold of 40, pore size is
reported as the equivalent spherical diameter of pores in micrometres. Pore connectivity is reported as the proportion of total
observed porosity that is present in each pore, and to facilitate
comparison between samples, we also report the proportion of
total porosity that is present in the largest 20 pores.

3.1. Laboratory produced charcoal
Fig. 2 shows three-dimensional images of raw wood, 300 and
600 pine charcoal as well randomly selected single image slices
through the volumes and maps of observed pore space at
a threshold of 40. It can be seen that while major vessels can be
readily identiﬁed in all specimens, smaller pores, particularly
towards the centre of the volumes, have begun to break down and
merge in the charcoal samples compared to the wood. The concentration of this process towards the centre of the volume is likely
to be due to relatively higher gas pressures associated with devolatilization in the centre of the samples compared with the outer
regions, where gases can more directly escape from the material.
An observed reduction in pore space towards the outside of the
charcoal fragments may also be due to pyrolytic ﬁxation of some
volatile material in pore space during its transport out of the
fragments.
Table 1 provides a summary of the physical characteristics of all
the laboratory-produced samples. Pyrolysis at 300  C resulted in
shrinkage to 80% of the unpyrolysed volume and a reduction in
density to 56% of the original wood density, while pyrolysis at
600  C resulted in shrinkage to 43% of the original volume and
a density reduction to 51% of the original wood density, as has been
previously found for other species (e.g. Byrne and Nagle, 1997). This
behaviour is the result of the progressive loss of volatiles during
pyrolysis and in the absence of other processes should lead to
a simple reduction in pore size, however, in accord with other

3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the estimates of porosity and pore size distribution
for a range of threshold greyscale values for two of the endmember laboratory-produced pine charcoals. It can be seen that
both porosity and pore size are critically dependant on the
threshold chosen, with porosity, for example, varying by a factor of
four for thresholds varying from 20 to 80. While visual comparison
of thresholded images with the raw image clearly demonstrated
that thresholds of 20 and 80 do not yield realistic maps of actual
pore space, it proved difﬁcult to reliably assign an appropriate
threshold value between these values using purely objective criteria. It should be noted that the actual total porosity of Pinus sylvestris is 65–75% (Usta, 2003) but most pores are <20 mm in
diameter, with only 10–15% of wood volume occupied by pore
space large enough to be resolved at the 21 mm pixel size used in
this study (Baines et al., 1983). Likewise, walls separating pores, but
<21 mm in thickness, are not resolvable in this study. Thus, in this
study we are dealing with micro- and meso-porosity above 21 mm
and hence the term ‘observed porosity’ is adopted.

studies (Klose and Schinkel, 2002) observed pore size in all pyrolysed pine samples increased as discussed below.
Fig. 3 shows the observed porosity of all pyrolysed samples
while Fig. 4 shows the distribution of observed porosity across
different pore size classes. The raw wood has the lowest observed
porosity (0.8%) and the highest proportion of pores in the smallest
size class (24 mm) with no pores greater than 120 mm. Pyrolysis in
nitrogen at progressively higher temperatures results in an
approximately tripling of the observed porosity by 600  C (2.3%).
While pyrolysis in nitrogen does not greatly affect the proportion of
small pores, the maximum pore size doubles to 240 mm during
pyrolysis at 600  C. Adding 2% oxygen to the pyrolysis gas stream

increases observed porosity at both 300 and 600  C, relative to that
under N2 only, and dramatically increases the relative proportion of
larger pore sizes. When the 300  C and 600  C charcoals (both
originally produced under N2 only) are further subjected to
chemical oxidation, the observed porosity of these samples shows
a dramatic increase to 26.6 and 12.0% respectively, and pore size
distributions are produced that are similar to those produced by
introducing O2 into the gas stream.

the largest 20 pores) is 35.1% for 300  C and 54.7% for 600  C. These
ﬁgures are similar to or lower than that in the raw wood, where the
largest 20 pores comprise 58% of the total pore space (Table 1 and
Fig. 5). Pyrolysis in 2% O2, or chemical oxidation of charcoal pyrolysed in N2 dramatically increases the connectivity of pore space in
the resultant material. For charcoal treated in either of these ways,
74–84% of total observed porosity is contained in the largest 20
pores and more than half the total pore space is contained within
the single largest pore in each sample.
Taken together, the data suggest a consistent pattern of porosity
development during pyrolysis. Despite the considerable shrinkage
that occurs during the pyrolysis process, and the likelihood that
some volatile compounds were pyrolysed within existing pore space
before they were able to escape from the sample interior, both observed porosity and pore size increases with increasing temperature
in a nitrogen atmosphere. This is likely to be due to the progressive
rupture of cell and vessel walls and the development of fractures
resulting from the pressure produced by escaping volatiles. This is
likely to also be the case for micropores below the scale that can be
resolved in this study. Thus, the process of charcoal production by
pyrolysis results in a matrix of connected meso- to macroporosity
within charcoals and this means that a considerable proportion of
charcoal surface area should be readily accessible both to soil solutions and soil microbiota following burial in soil or sediment.
3.2. Ancient charcoal
Tomographic images of a comparatively well-preserved charcoal from the Nauwalabila I site in northern Australia (NLB L29 66)
are presented in Fig. 6. This sample contains a large number of

vertically extensive vessels of a few hundred micrometres in diameter. Isolation of the X-ray dense regions of the image, which
observations by stereo microscope suggest are dominantly quartz
sand grains weakly cemented by clays and iron oxides, indicates
that the mineral fraction is largely cemented to the outside of the
fragment although isolated grains have become lodged in the larger
pores in the interior of the fragment.
In contrast, a poorly preserved charcoal from the same deposit
(NLB K29 57), at approximately the same depth and possibly
derived from the same species (Fig. 7) can be seen to be pervasively
altered. While the macrostructure of the charcoal is preserved,
isolation of the most X-ray dense portions of the specimen (Fig. 7c)
demonstrates that the sample is not only coated to a large degree by
authigenic iron oxide minerals, but much of the interior pore space
has been ﬁlled or coated by authigenic iron oxide minerals. Crosssections of the sample (Fig. 7a and b) show that there is also
a strong gradation in X-ray density throughout the sample from
dense mineral coatings of fractures and vessel walls to patchy
variations in X-ray density through the matrix of the sample, suggesting ﬁne iron oxide impregnation of the sample matrix at particle sizes below the resolution of the technique. Bird et al. (2002)
used energy dispersive X-ray analysis of a polished section of
similarly altered charcoal from the same deposit to demonstrate
the presence of iron dispersed through the sample matrix and this
study provides a more detailed three-dimensional picture of the
distribution of mineral alteration/replacement of the charcoal.
Given that authigenic iron oxides commonly contain adsorbed and
structurally incorporated carbon (Bird et al., 1994), this is a likely
cause of contamination of radiocarbon dates of charcoal from the
deeper levels of this archaeological deposit (Bird et al., 2002).

Fig. 8 provides an example of a charcoal of Jurassic age. This
charcoal had a patchy whitish coating of authigenic mineralization
on its outer surface, but it was unclear whether this was a surface
phenomenon or whether the mineralization was pervasive. The
tomographic images of the specimen suggest that while there does
not seem to have been active replacement of charcoal by the

authigenic phase, it has dominantly precipitated along fractures
following growth rings in the original wood but also to a lesser
degree it has precipitated in smaller pores in the interior of the
sample that are not obviously connected to the exterior.
The observed porosities of the three natural charcoals are given
in Table 1 and while the Jurassic sample has an observed porosity

similar to the laboratory produced charcoals (2.8%) the Nauwalabila
charcoals both have substantially higher porosities (20–37%),
reﬂecting the large number of large vessels in those samples. Fig. 9
demonstrates that the pore size distribution in the Jurassic sample
is similar to the laboratory produced charcoals, but again because of
the large number of large vessels, the Nauwalabila charcoals have
a comparatively small proportion (<20%) of their total observed
porosity in the smallest pores and a higher proportion in larger
pore sizes, with maximum sizes up to 500 mm equivalent spherical
diameter. Fig. 10 shows that the connectivity of pores in the Jurassic
sample is the lowest of any samples, whereas 58–63% of the total
pore space is present as a single connected structure and over 95%
of the total pore space is present in the 20 biggest pores (Table 1) in
the Nauwalabila samples. Iron oxide impregnation in NLB K19 57
has resulted in a decrease in overall observed porosity to 20% relative to NLB K29 66 (37%) and a relative decrease in the proportion
of total porosity in the largest pores, presumably due to partial
inﬁlling of some of the larger vessels by authigenic iron oxide
coatings (Fig. 10).
4. Conclusions
X-ray microtomography has been able to elucidate the internal
structure and location of mineral phases in a range of ancient
charcoals enabling a better understanding of the processes that can
lead to alteration and degradation of charcoal in the natural environment. With each new generation of mCT systems available,
sample spatial resolution will improve; a nano-tomography system
is presently available, however the analytical capability of this
system is limited to small sample sizes (http://www.skyscan.be).
Application of X-ray microtomography to laboratory-produced
charcoal has demonstrated that under slightly oxidizing conditions
of pyrolysis, or after chemical oxidation, observed porosity, pore
size and the connectivity of pore space are all dramatically
increased, despite signiﬁcant shrinkage of the pyrolysed material.
Keech et al. (2005) concluded from a two-dimensional transverse
section study of porosity in charcoal from a range of species that
macroporosity, rather than total porosity, was the main factor in
determining sorptive capacity for secondary plant metabolites. The
results from the three-dimensional study presented here suggest
that as well as the primary porosity structure imposed by the
original wood, pyrolysis conditions (temperature and oxygen
availability) is also likely to be an important determinant of sorptive capacity, particularly through connecting smaller pore spaces
that may appear to be isolated in two dimensions.
The results of this study suggest that for charcoal in the natural
environment, where at least some oxygen is likely to have been
locally available during pyrolysis and the local depositional environment is oxidizing, the interiors of charcoal fragments are likely
to be readily accessible both to soils solutions and soil microbiota.
This means that charcoal is potentially open to contamination from
a variety of sources, underscoring the need for robust techniques
that can veriﬁably remove contamination prior to radiocarbon
dating. While tomographic ‘screening’ of all samples prior to
radiocarbon dating would not be feasible, the technique should be
readily applicable to targeted studies attempting to determine the
effectiveness of pretreatment techniques in removing contamination prior to radiocarbon dating.
