The Grotte Chauvet is world renowned for
the quality and diversity of its Palaeolithic
art. Fire was particularly important to the
occupants, providing light and producing
charcoal for use in motifs. Charcoal samples
were taken systematically from features
associated with the two main occupation phases (Aurignacian and Gravettian).
Analysis showed it to be composed almost
entirely of pine (Pinus sp.), indicating the
harsh climatic conditions at this period.
No distinction in wood species was found
between either the two occupation episodes
or the various depositional contexts. The
results throw new light on the cultural and
palaeoenvironmental factors that influenced
choices underlying the collection of wood for
charcoal production.

Illuminating the cave, drawing in black

An extraordinary testament to the technical and artistic maturity of Palaeolithic societies,
Chauvet-Pont d’Arc Cave in France provides a unique context for prehistoric research.
Investigations carried out within the cave have highlighted the exceptional character of
this site, not only from an archaeological perspective, but also palaeontologically and
geomorphologically (Clottes & Geneste 2007; Geneste 2012). Study has yielded invaluable
information regarding parietal (cave) art, its dating and the techniques used (e.g. drawing,
smudging/blending, impression and engraving) during the various periods of occupation.
It has also illuminated the animal taxa, the skeletal remains of which are dominated
by cave bears (4000 bones and bone fragments) (Clottes 2001; Fosse & Philippe 2005;
Quiles et al. 2016). Studies have also provided valuable insights into the evolution of
the cave itself and its physical environment, as well as the environmental and climatic
conditions that prevailed during the periods of occupation (Clottes 2001; Genty et al.
2004; Sadier et al. 2012; Delannoy et al. 2013). In addition, detailed studies of human
behaviour within the site have been undertaken on the basis of the traces left by fires,
heating of the cave walls and traces of charcoal found on the walls (Fosse & Philippe
2005; Geneste 2005a; Delannoy et al. 2012; Brodard et al. 2014; Ferrier et al. 2014;
Guibert et al. 2015). Dating of parietal art, hearths, torch marks, animal bones and
geomorphological features (Valladas et al. 2001, Valladas & Clottes 2003) has enabled
the construction of a coherent chronology for the known occupations, as well as for the
sealing of the cave. Two distinct periods of human activity have been identified, one
dating from 37 000–33 500 BP, and the other from 31 000–28 000 BP (Quiles et al. 2014,
2016).
Fire played a special role at Chauvet-Pont d’Arc, providing not only light but also the
charcoal used to create black motifs. Wood charcoal fragments, associated with various
traces of fire, constitute an important part of the botanical record preserved within the cave.
Numerous samples have been analysed to provide 14 C dates and information regarding the
vegetal environment and climatic contexts (Théry-Parisot & Thiébault 2005; Quiles et al.
2014, 2016). Charcoal also allows us to investigate the cultural dimension of technical
choices that underlie wood management. Previous studies have, for example, highlighted
the capacities of prehistoric societies, at least since the Neanderthals, to adapt their fuel to
the various functions of the fire, using coal, wood or bone as fuel, where necessary (Théry
et al. 1995; Théry-Parisot 2001, 2002a & b). Within the Chauvet-Pont d’Arc Cave, formal
hearths, areas of burning and scattered charcoal fragments on the cave floors, torch marks
and thermal modification of the cave walls all attest to the intensity and diversity of fire use,
not only for lighting the cave interior, but also for producing paint materials. Fireplaces
are also focal points for social interaction and played a central role in prehistoric societies
(see e.g. Stockton 1981). In addition to possible symbolic aspects, which are difficult to
pinpoint, other uses of fire—including heating, thermal treatment (cooking, drying and
transformation of raw materials) and the repelling of wild animals—are also difficult to
identify, although we can assume that they were significant. The study of charcoal specimens
from a representative group of contexts within the cave, coupled with the results from recent
experiments on the combustion properties and mechanical characteristics of wood charcoal,

have yielded new information on the use of wood for the purposes of lighting and black
paint production.

Materials and methods
Particular attention has been paid to diversifying the sample locations and contexts so
that they can be taken to be representative of the two main periods of occupation
(Aurignacian and Gravettian). This sampling has been undertaken in 11 sectors (Figure 1 &
Table 1), including Aurignacian hearths (the Candle Gallery and the Megaloceros Gallery);
Gravettian torch marks (Gallery of the Crosshatching, the Candle Gallery and the Skull
Chamber); cave floor charcoal from undated accumulations outside identified features
(Gallery of the Crosshatching, the Megaloceros Gallery, the Brunel Chamber, Chamber of
the Bear Hollows, the Red Panels Gallery, the Candle Gallery, the Skull Chamber, the End
Chamber and the Hillaire Chamber); and undated fragments found directly below black
drawings (Skull Chamber, Hillaire Chamber: Panel of the Reindeer, Megaloceros Gallery).
With the exception of one sample (sample GE-1 from the entrance area), which was
retrieved using fine sieving in the laboratory, the samples were collected manually, using
tweezers. This unconventional sampling method, imposed by the limited accessibility
of various parts of the site, and which involves selective, non-exhaustive collection, is a
response to the constraints imposed by the exceptional nature of the cave (i.e. a UNESCO

World Heritage Site). This brings into question the representativeness of the samples. The
work of Chabal (1997) clearly shows that manual collection, which favours the selection of
large, easily seen fragments, may introduce a statistical bias. Nevertheless, random collection
from different contexts, targeting small fragments and large fragments in equal measure,
limits any potential bias. Taxonomic identification was carried out using reflected-light
optical microscopy along the three anatomical planes of the wood, and by comparison with
modern carbonised wood samples. The fragments, measuring between 2 and 20mm in size,
are well preserved with the exception of the charcoal residues from torch marks; in this case,
the anatomical structure of the charcoal has been greatly altered.

Results
A total of 171 charcoal fragments have been identified: 23 from hearths, 36 from torch
marks, 46 from the cave floor at the foot of panels of black paintings (from which
they probably originate), and 66 from isolated charcoal specimens or from concentrations
occurring outside identified features (Table 1).
Only two taxa have been identified within the corpus of samples, comprising one
species of the Sylvestres subsection of the genus Pinus (Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine)/Pinus
nigra (black pine) subsp. salzmannii/Pinus mugo (dwarf pine)/Pinus uncinata (mountain
pine) (the various species of pine have not been differentiated with certitude on the
basis of anatomical criteria), which represents 170 of 171 fragments identified (Figure 2);
and a single fragment of the genus Rhamnus (buckthorn), which came from the Cactus
Gallery. With the exception of this isolated fragment, the composition of the assemblage
shows no distinction between either the two main episodes of occupation of the cave, or
between the various deposition contexts (hearths, torch smoke stains, paintings, scattered
deposits). Thus, the almost single-taxon composition of the assemblage, originating from
deposits that are distinct and which probably span a long period, raises several questions.
The taphonomic hypothesis of a differential representation of taxa after combustion has
been experimentally refuted (Théry-Parisot & Chabal 2010). Does it reflect, however, an
ecological reality (a landscape dominated by pine) with opportunistic collection of the most
abundant wood, or a selective collection of pine (both of which must have been transcultural
behaviours)? These hypotheses will be discussed in terms of the environmental context, the

Discussion
The palaeoenvironmental context
As anthracology first and foremost reflects the immediate environment at a site scale,
pine was probably the predominant available local resource, which is perfectly coherent
with the climatic context of the period. Regional palaeoecological data, however, refute
the hypothesis of a single-taxon landscape, a refutation confirmed by the presence of
Rhamnus in a sample from the Red Panels Gallery. The results of 14 C dating emphasise
two principal and distinct occupation phases within the cave (Quiles et al. 2016), the first
being Aurignacian (37 000–33 500 BP) followed by a Gravettian phase (31 000–28 000
BP). These phases coincide with a period of instability corresponding to a succession of
climatic oscillations at the interface between isotopic stages 3 (more temperate) and 2
(colder). During the long glacial episodes of the Quaternary, climatic conditions limited
the presence of woody taxa to certain areas known as ‘refuges’, where conditions were
favourable to their survival. These ‘hotspots’ enjoyed a warmer and more humid climate
than neighbouring areas (Petit et al. 2003; Médail & Diadema 2009). In this generally
cold context, characterised by open landscapes with few trees, pine is the principal taxon
(a heliophilic taxon with an affinity for mountainous environments). Cold-tolerant shrubs
(birch, willow, juniper and buckthorn) also benefit from the favourable conditions in these
refuge areas (Delhon & Thiébault 2005; Médail & Diadema 2009; Harrison & SánchezGoñi 2010; Desprat et al. 2015). Thus, even though pine is the main woody taxon available
in the vicinity of the site during the different episodes of occupation, the presence of other
taxa should not be discounted. The determinist hypothesis of default exploitation of the
main taxon available in the immediate environment is probably too simplistic. It is possible
to envisage a cultural hypothesis that relates to the specificity of Palaeolithic occupation.

Wood management in the socio-cultural context of Chauvet-Pont d’Arc
The management of wood resources would have imposed a constraint on Palaeolithic ways
of life, which are characterised by significant mobility, seasonal occupation of sites and
a relatively limited tool kit. These would undoubtedly have had an impact on firewood
acquisition (Théry-Parisot et al. 2016) (Figure 3). Prehistoric hunter-gatherer mobility
patterns are often discussed in terms of a spectrum ranging between ‘circulating’ and
‘radiating’ mobility conditioning the length of the occupations, from very brief to multiseasonal residential base-camps. The management of firewood exists within the restrictive
framework of these mobility patterns: deadwood (including driftwood), already dry and
easy to gather, optimally ensures the supply during brief periods of occupation. Depending
on the available biomass, it could have been either a main resource or an additional resource
in residential camps. In contrast, selective tree-felling, where wood is cut and dried over
several months, is more suited to long-term occupation. This strategy could have been
partly used, however, to provide fuel during short-term occupations, when the necromass

was not sufficiently abundant or was inaccessible (covered by snow, for instance): this would
imply a degree of forward planning and re-occupation of the same camp site.
The preferential collection of deadwood has been demonstrated on many Palaeolithic
sites through the identification of anatomical wood decay features, still perceptible after
burning (Allué et al. 2009; Henry & Théry-Parisot 2014; Vidal Matutano et al. 2017). As
the wood is already dry and accessible on the ground, this practice dispenses with the need
for tree-felling, which, although technically possible, would have required a subsequent
storage phase of at least two years. This assumption is based on the fact that, with the
exception of certain specialised activities (e.g. smoking or thermal treatment of certain raw
materials), firewood generally needs to be dry for burning. The use of immediately available
deadwood is an effective alternative to wood storage, provided that the resource is abundant
and dry enough to meet all of the energy needs of the group. At Chauvet-Pont d’Arc, the
high degree of natural branch shedding of pine means that it would have provided an
important, immediately usable stock of deadwood. This would have been ideally suited to
occasional occupation of the site, provided that this occupation took place outside of the
snow season, when fallen deadwood would not have been easily accessible. The fact that
fuel management at Chauvet-Pont d’Arc was probably based on the deliberate selection of
a specific physiological, phenological and morphological state of wood is reflected in the
virtually exclusive selection of the taxon that dominates the necromass, i.e. pine.

Wood selection?
Nonetheless, the hypothesis of deliberate selection of pine cannot be avoided. Beyond
symbolic aspects, other motivations involving combustion and/or physical properties of

pine could have motivated the preferential use of this taxon. As we are discussing firewood,
however, the question of preference is always a difficult issue. If the combustion properties of
a particular taxon were purely dependent on their physical and chemical properties, then it
would be possible to combine information regarding the form of the combustion contexts
and their vegetal contents in order to identify the function of the fires. Apart from rare
exceptions, however, the taxonomic composition of a hearth rarely allows its function to
be determined for two main reasons: the combustion properties do not depend, or depend
little, on taxa, and the selection criteria may be based on preferences or beliefs that are
completely outside the scope of the anthracologist.
The notion of ‘species’ is a ‘recent’ (1758) development, based on Linnaean classification,
which is anachronistic for prehistoric societies who probably classified wood more on the
basis of functional, rather than botanical, criteria. Ethnographic examples show that the
selection of taxa is governed by parameters that are traditionally set by each group, according
to criteria that are almost as varied as the communities themselves (e.g. Levi-Strauss 1962).
They also show that, within these communities, the selection of firewood is not always
based on objective combustion criteria and combustion properties, even though it is
these properties that are proposed by the communities themselves to justify the selection.
Selection can also be based on criteria relating to form, physiological and phenological
states that determine the properties of the wood to the same extent as the taxa themselves.
Combustion properties (e.g. calorific value, flammability, persistence and height of flames,
duration of calcination) depend on a number of parameters, among which morphology
(size and diameter) and physiological and phenological state (dead or living, dry or green,
sound or altered) play a determining role. The state of the wood, its dimensions and its
availability are all criteria that may influence the collection of wood, although this cannot
be proven. Finally, the notion of a good fuel is not directly transposable to prehistoric
societies, whose use of fire was much more diverse than that of most modern westernised
societies. For each cultural group, there is a palette of fuels adapted to the diversity of fireassociated activities. In the case of Chauvet-Pont d’Arc, the selection of pine for its objective
properties might reflect the suitability of this taxon for the attested uses, i.e. at the very least
for lighting (combustion properties) and as a raw material for creating charcoal paintings
(physical properties).

Lighting and drawing with pine wood at Chauvet-Pont d’Arc
Lighting was primarily provided by torches, which are evidenced during Gravettian
frequentation of the cave: the use of torches has been identified thanks to the presence
of almost 250 black stains, attributed to the reviving of torches, or to simple contact of
the torch flame with the cave wall. The role of the Aurignacian hearths, only one of which
is intact—the others having been disturbed by animal or human activity, or buried under
superficial deposits that mask them (Brodard et al. 2014; Ferrier et al. 2014)—cannot be
accurately established. They may have served successively, or simultaneously, to produce
charcoal for domestic activities, and for providing light (Geneste 2005b). Even though the
primary purpose of the fires may not have been the provision of light, they obviously did
serve that end. The radiative properties of fire clearly provide light, the intensity of which

is proportional to the height, thickness, persistence and temperature of the flames. While
morphological, physical and chemical characteristics determine the performance of wood in
terms of radiation, the level of humidity remains a key factor. Only wood that is perfectly
dry guarantees homogeneous and persistent combustion of the flammable gases. Specific
gravity and extractable content are also important factors (Boulet et al. 2009). As they
combine characteristics of i) high flammability due to the presence of resins comprised
of terpene hydrocarbons with a high calorific value; and ii) harmonious combustion of
flammable gases due to their specific gravity (around 0.5), the burning of small-calibre pine
branches could easily provide a comfortable heat level and lasting light within an enclosed
space.
It is probable that at least some of the charcoal intended for the black paintings was
produced in fire pits within the cave. This would explain the occurrence of the same taxon
in the fire pits and in the charcoal scattered at the foot of the painted cave walls (from
which the fragments may have originated). The creation of the black paintings supposes the
production of a significant quantity of wood charcoal of a size and technical quality (e.g.
rigidity and plasticity) suitable for the creation of images. The balance between the quantity
and quality of wood charcoal produced by the burning of pine is currently being studied.
Experimental burning carried out under laboratory conditions and new results obtained in
cave contexts have shown respectively that wood charcoal represents 1.3–1.7 per cent of the
mass of wood burned (Théry-Parisot & Chabal 2010; Ithem program- ANR-10-LABX-52)
(Figure 4).
Given the extent of the painted surfaces, we can assume that a significant quantity of
charcoal was produced for this purpose. As wood charcoal is a friable material that wears
down with use, a significant quantity of wood, with dimensions large enough to produce
easily gripped pieces of charcoal, was probably burned solely for the production of painting
material. This is evidenced, for example, by the abundance of charcoal found directly at the
foot of the Alcove of the Felines in the Hillaire Chamber (Figure 5).
Issues relating to the processes used to manufacture charcoal for painting, and the
technical characteristics of such charcoal, are part of a more general consideration of
pigments used in prehistory (Fritz et al. 2015). Current techniques in the commercial
manufacture of drawing charcoal are based on the process of anaerobic pyrolysis. The
Chauvet-Pont d’Arc replicas were, however, executed using charcoal produced under classic
oxygenated conditions (G. Tosello pers. comm.). The mechanical characteristics of the
charcoal itself depend on carbonisation processes that are consistent with open burning,
with average burning temperatures of close to 400°C, and with significant variations in
temperature within the same fire pit (up to 800°C). These variations depend on the
structure of the fire pit, the quantity and moisture content of the wood used, and the
arrangement of the wood batches (Théry-Parisot & Chabal 2010; Théry-Parisot et al.
2010). In addition to the production process, the quality of the wood itself necessarily
influences its suitability for use as drawing charcoal. The harder the wood, the finer the
line produced. Inversely, a soft wood produces a broader line. The key role played by
density in the mechanical and physical properties of wood is well established (Bergman
et al. 2010). Moreover, we know that carbonisation preserves the density ratio between
taxa (Chrzavzez et al. 2014). The resistance of the charcoal to crushing, which defines the

treatment itself (oxygenation, temperatures and temperature ramp) and on the quality of
the wood (moisture content, physiological state and calibre) (Korkut et al. 2008; Ascough
et al. 2011). Variability in firing temperatures results from the heterogeneity of the thermal
fluxes within the open fire, as has been mentioned previously. In addition, measurements of
resistance to crushing, undertaken under laboratory conditions, have shown that the loss of
rigidity of wood charcoal—i.e. loss of its physical properties—can reach up to 50 per cent

when the wood is altered (Théry-Parisot & Chabal 2010). Thus, a material that is perfectly
suited for use as a pigment can be readily obtained by selecting a wood of average density,
such as pine, in different phenological and physiological states, ranging from healthy wood
to wood that has been degraded by biological organisms naturally present in the necromass.

Conclusions
This study of wood charcoal fragments from Chauvet-Pont d’Arc has focused on the two
main episodes of occupation of the cave and on different contexts, from the Aurignacian
hearths to the Gravettian torch marks. The sample also includes undated charcoal fragments
scattered over the cave floor or at the foot of groups of black charcoal paintings. With
the exception of a single Rhamnus fragment from the Red Panels Gallery, all of the
fragments identified are of Scots pine/black pine. Pine is a pioneer taxon with an affinity for
mountainous environments and survived in refuges during the coldest periods of the last

ice age. As such, it attests, first and foremost, to the harsh climatic conditions that prevailed
during the various occupations of the cave, without providing a distinction between them.
While difficult to discuss in terms of symbolic significance, the collection of pine seems to
have been transcultural and governed more by the convergence of elements favouring its
use, than by an environmental constraint (as other taxa were also present in the immediate
vicinity of the cave). For highly mobile societies, pine presents a number of characteristics
that may provide motives for its selection: the significant natural shedding of branches,
which provides a readily available supply of deadwood; its combustion properties, which
rendered it suitable for the illumination of the cave; and its mechanical properties, which,
as shown at Chauvet-Pont d’Arc, rendered it ideal for producing drawing charcoal and
pigment for the smudging and blending techniques used in cave paintings.
