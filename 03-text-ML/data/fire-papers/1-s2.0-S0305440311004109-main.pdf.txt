The zooarchaeological study of small-vertebrate consumption requires a taphonomical approach to
differentiate animal bones that were incidentally incorporated from those that were intentionally
exploited in the past human subsistence. In order to make this distinction, the relationship between
archaeological small-rodent burned bones and prehistoric human behavior was explored using an
experimental cooking study as a modern analogue. During the cooking experiment the entire carcasses
of three guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) and two yellow-toothed cavies (Galea leucoblephara) were placed in
the coals of an open ﬁre that simulate a real campﬁre, rotating their positions until the meat was
completely cooked. Subsequently, the intensity of burning damage and the loss of skeletal elements were
analyzed at macroscopical levels. The data was used to identify cooking evidence in the Ctenomyidae and
Caviidae rodent bones recovered from Quebrada del Real 1 (ca. 6000e300 BP, Córdoba, Argentina).
Remarkable similarities between the archaeological and analogical records were found, including the
distinctive burning pattern on the distal extremities of the unmeaty long bones (e.g, radii and tibiae), the
high frequency of broken incisor teeth and the loss of autopodium elements. Based on these comparative
results, it is suggested that the small-rodent assemblages of QR1 were primary accumulated by humans
though butchery, cooking and consumption related activities. Extending this study to other archaeological sites in South America may help to identify the prehistoric bone collectors of these small-animals.

1. Introduction
The recovering of small-mammal bone remains in the archaeological record recognizes two classes of associations: (1) physical
associations, where bones and tools are simple found in the same
deposit, and (2) behavioral associations, in which human and smallmammal interaction is demonstrated by unequivocal markers (see
a review in Stahl, 1996). Thus, their zooarchaeological study always
requires a taphonomically informed approach to differentiate the
animal bones that were incidentally incorporated from those that
were intentionally exploited in the past human subsistence. In
order to make this distinction, methodological tools are needed to
evaluate the integrity and taphonomic history of faunal assemblages (e.g., Andrews, 1995; Lyman, 1994; Smoke and Stahl, 2004).
Human behavioral interaction with small-vertebrates can be
measured directly by the presence of cut-marks on bones
(Laroulandie, 2005a). However, it is not always easy to recognize
cut-marks on small-vertebrate bones because sometimes their

depth and width are superﬁcial (Lloveras et al., 2009; Quintana,
2005), being similar to trampling marks (Domínguez-Rodrigo
et al., 2009). In addition, evidence of butchery or modiﬁcation
from human tools use is commonly lacking because smaller bodies
are in less need of processing for consumption (Stahl, 1996). Thus,
the zooarchaeological study of small-mammals have to rely on less
reliable markers such as the presence of burned bones, behavioral
characteristic, skeletal representation, breakage patterns and/or the
age proﬁle of the bone assemblage (e. g., Pardiñas, 1999a, 1999b).
Each of these markers should be qualiﬁed individually on a case by
case basis, taking into account the multiplicity of post-burial
processes that could affect the faunal remains (Crandall and Stahl,
1995; Pardiñas, 1999a; Laroulandie, 2005a; Lloveras et al., 2009;
Simonetti and Cornejo, 1991). For example, Pardiñas (1999a, 1999b;
Pardiñas et al., 2011) used the burned bone pattern on speciﬁc
small-rodent species to discuss their prehispanic exploitation in
Pampean and Patagonian archaeological sites. These arguments
were reinforced when prey-size and burning damage are positively
correlated (Simonetti and Cornejo, 1991) or if the faunal assemblage
comes from rockshelters where natural ﬁres are exceptional (Klein
and Cruz-Uribe, 1984).

Fire has a central role in food preparation (see Wranghan, 2009).
Thus, it is reasonable to expect that cooking activities may produce
burned bones if the small-mammal carcasses were directly exposed
to high temperatures (Lyman, 1994). However, the relationship
between small-mammal burned bones and cooking is complex
because there are several human behaviors and post-depositional
processes that can produce or mimic burning damage (Cain,
2005; De Nigris, 2004; Lyman, 1994; Nicholson, 1993; Stiner,
2005). On the other hand, the actualistic studies on burning were
mostly focused on large mammals (see a review in De Nigris, 2004;
Gifford-González, 1989; Shipman et al., 1984; Nicholson, 1993;
Stiner, 2005). Relatively little actualistic data has been published on
small-vertebrate burned bone modiﬁcation, including examples
made on grey partridges (Perdix perdix), terrapins (Pelosius adansoni), European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and Cape dune
mole-rats (Bathyergus suillus) (Henshilwood, 1997; Laroulandie,
2001; Lloveras et al., 2009; Rybczynski et al., 1996).
The aim of this article is to explore the relationship between
small-rodent burned bones and human behavior using an experimental cooking study as a modern analogue. In order to meet this
objective, ﬁve small-caviomorph rodents were cooked according to
ethnographic observation. Then, the intensity of burning damage
was used to identify reliable markers of cooking in the Ctenomyidae and Caviidae rodent bones recovered from Quebrada del Real 1
(ca. 6000e300 BP, Córdoba, Argentina).

2. Experimental cooking of caviomorph rodents
The entire carcasses of three guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) and two
yellow-toothed cavies (Galea leucoblephara) with live weight ranging
226e910 g were placed in the coal of an open ﬁre and rotated for
60e65 min until the meat was totally cooked. This technique tries
to replicate ethnographic observations made on small-caviomorph
rodents and others taxa similar in size and morphology (e.g., Cavia
aperea, Acosta and Pafundi, 2005: 68; Ctenomys sp., Hesse, 1984: 47;
Bathyergus suillus, Henshilwood, 1997:661). The carcasses of C. porcellus were purchased in a Peruvian market whereas G. leucoblephara
were trapped for taxonomical studies and included in the
experiment.
Experimental ﬁre was simply arranged intending to simulate
a real ethnographic campﬁre. The ﬁre used hardwood of Eucalyptus
sp. No pieces of wood were greater than 5 cm of diameter. The
peak temperature was reached 10 min of setting, with maximum
temperatures of ca. 400  C. Once in the laboratory, the carcasses
were boiled during ca. 4 h, stripped of the adhering soft tissue and
dried for macroscopic level description. Two-millimeter mesh was
used in order to recover all the small-bone pieces.
Two aspects of the assemblage were examined: the pattern of
burned bone modiﬁcation and the pattern of elements loss. Thus, the
experimental assemblage was quantiﬁed by the Number of Identiﬁed Specimens per Taxon (NISP), differentiating unburned, burned

(NISP) burned (q), calcined-carbonized (cc) and affected by breakage and/or disintegration (f). Black to greyish colors represents those portions mostly affected by ﬁre; b) Minimal
Number of Elements (MNE). Shading denotes the elements with major differences between observed MNE and expected MNE.

Greatest damage occurred on distal shafts and ends of radii, ulnae
and tibiae, which acquiring a brown to black coloration on parts
less protected by muscle tissues (Figs. 1 and 2). Damage does not
extend the distal 1/5 of the bone length. Thus, proximal portions
of these skeletal elements were not affected and maintained
the original cream-white coloration of the unburned bones (see
Laroulandie, 2001; Lloveras et al., 2009; Figs. 1 and 2). Burning
sometimes resulted in the high susceptibility to breakage of the
damaged portion of the bones (e.g., distal tibiae and ulnae) or even
in their total disintegration (e.g. autopodium elements) (Fig. 1).
Axial and proximal limb-bones remained also unburned because
the meat protected them from ﬁre (Fig. 1). The only exceptions were
the upper and lower incisor teeth and the bone around them. Upper
incisors were slightly burned but also heavily affected by transverse
breakage in its distal third (Figs. 1 and 2), whereas the lower incisors presented the brown coloration of the charred bones (see
Henshilwood, 1997; Lloveras et al., 2009).

and carbonized-calcined bones (Stiner, 1994). The Minimal Number
of Elements (MNE) was also considered to evaluate the differential
conservation and the pattern of elements loss (Lyman, 1994).
The intensity of the burning damage was sorted by colors
according to Shipman et al. (1984). Burnt areas were recorded and
described on each skeletal element according to the portion
(i.e. proximal, shaft or distal). Colors of burning were described as
unburned (white-cream), slightly burned (yellow-reddish-brown),
carbonized (blue-black) and calcined (blue-greyish). This chromatic
scale was generally consistent with those used in previous experimental studies of burning bones as a proxy data to assess the
degree of thermolteration (see Nicholson, 1993; Stiner, 2005;
Lloveras et al., 2009).
Cooking experiment shows that burning damage was a frequent
form of bone modiﬁcation and a diagnostic mark of cooking
activities exposing the carcasses directly on ﬁre. Of all the collected
specimens, 13,5% were burned (Fig. 1). The burnt marks occurred in
a range of appearance from superﬁcial speckles to heavily charring
(Figs. 1 and 2; Tables 1 and 2). As intensity of burning increased, the
fragility of the bone and its probability of being fragmented also
increased. Nearly all the burnt specimens were appendicular.

Quebrada del Real 1 (QR1; 1914 m) is a cave located in the
Pampa de Achala Provincial Hydrical Reserve, central Argentina
(Rivero et al. 2008e2009; Fig. 3). Three cultural components (sensu
Politis and Madrid, 2001) were detected during its excavation. The
lowest component (C1) is associated to lanceolate projectile points
and charcoal dated at 5980  50 years BP (LP-2133) and 7360  120
BP (LP-2339). The middle component (C2) is characterized by the
presence of triangular projectile points with slightly to markedly
concave bases dated at 2950  90 years BP (LP-2042; charcoal).
Finally, the top component (C3) contains small-stemmed triangular
arrowpoints as well as pottery fragments. This assemblage was
temporal-assigned to the Late Holocene due to the absence of
radiocarbon dates (Rivero et al. 2008e2009). A detailed study of the
stratigraphical sequence, chronology, lithic artifacts, bone technology, faunal assemblage and micro-botanical remains from QRl 1
is in Medina et al. (in press), Rivero and López (2011), Rivero and
Medina (in press), Rivero et al. (2010), Rivero and Pastor (2009),
Rivero et al. (2008e2009).
This paper considers the 2754 small-vertebrate bone remains
obtained from the exploratory 2 m2 pit-sampling. Two-millimeter
mesh was used to sieve the sediments and recover all the smallbone pieces. Small-vertebrate was arbitrarily deﬁned as any prey
with a maximum live weight of 1 kg. Rodents, birds and other
small-taxa were identiﬁed in several Holocene archaeological sites
from Sierras of Córdoba. However, QR1 presents a high frequency of
these small animal bones accumulated along thousands of years,
providing an excellent opportunity to examine resource intensiﬁcation process previously proposed for the region (Medina and
Pastor, in press; Medina et al., in press; Rivero and Medina, in
press; Rivero et al. 2010; Rivero et al. 2008e2009).
Above the 50% of the assemblage from QR1 was constituted by
rodent tooth elements such as molars and broken incisors (toothbased NISP ¼ 1498). The remaining fraction included appendicular
and axial skeletal elements, mainly tibiae, pelves, skulls and mandibles (bone-based NISP ¼ 1256). This pattern of skeletal representation
agrees with other small-mammal assemblages associated with
human activities (e.g., Dewar and Jerardino, 2007; Hesse, 1984;
Pardiñas, 1999a).
Caviidae and Ctenomyidae rodents dominated the sequence
with over 95% of the NISP (Table 1; Medina et al., in press; Rivero
et al. 2008e2009). Caviidae were represented by the wild cavies
G. leucoblephara and Microcavia australis. Ctenomyidae included
a large and a small form of Ctenomys, but their taxonomical status is
under study (Verzi com. pers). The sigmodontine Holochilus

brasiliensis was present in all the components. Small-birds were
also recorded but in low-frequencies (<1%), especially in the upper
levels.
No bone evidenced tooth-marks and digestion damage that
characterize assemblages accumulated by raptor pellets and
mammalian carnivore scats (see a complete discussion in Medina
et al., in press). In contrast, a high percentage of the smallvertebrate assemblage presented cut-marks (37,7% of the bonebased NISP). Cut-marks were concentrated in mandibles (59,1%),
skulls (9,9%), pelves (11,7%) and tibiae (10,8%), mainly resulting
from skinning and dismembering activities (Medina et al., in press).
Traces of burning were present on few bones (Tables 1 and 2).
Sixty-one specimens (2,2%) of rodents (NISP ¼ 55) and other
small-vertebrate taxa (NISP ¼ 6) showed burning damage focused

in those bones less rich in meat located in terminal parts of the
skeleton. Burned bones were recovered in all the archaeological
sequence but higher frequencies were documented in Component
2 (layer 2). The 85,5% of the burnt marks have the reddish-brown
coloration of the slightly burned bones (sensu Shipman et al.,
1984). Only 14,5% presented the blue-black or the blue-greyish
colors of the carbonized and calcined bones. Burned long bones
were dominated by tibiae, showing damage only on the distal
shafts and ends of the elements (NISP ¼ 44; Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and
2). The damage on mandibles was restricted to the incisor teeth and
the anterior portion of the horizontal ramus. Burned bone modiﬁcation only affected small-prey with body size averaged 800 g,
including caviomorph and cricetid rodents as well as birds such as
coots (Fulica sp.) and tinamous (Tinamidae). Other smaller taxa
lacked of evidences of thermoalteration as the cricetid Reithrodon
auritus and passerine birds. This taxonomical and body size pattern
of burning damage suggested a long-term selective economic
behavior that reinforces the hypothesis of human consumption
(cf. Simonetti and Cornejo, 1991).
4. Discussion and conclusion
Experimental and archaeological rodent assemblages presented
several remarkable similarities (Table 3). Firstly, thermoalteration
was mostly restricted to the distal portions of unmeaty long-bones
such as tibiae and radii. This pattern is difﬁcult to associate with

natural ﬁres or with the post-consumption bone discard onto ﬁres. In
these cases, the probability that any particular element or any portion
of an element burns should be relatively equal (Hockett and Ferreira
Bicho, 2000). Pardiñas (1999a) correlated this distinctive burning
pattern with the retraction of the proximal muscular masses of the
limb-bones when they were cooked on ﬁre, exposing the unmeaty
distal portion of the bones to damage. Similar scenarios were

documented in other archaeological cases, not only in ungulates
bones (e. g., Gifford-González, 1989; Cain, 2005) but also in smallvertebrate assemblages (e. g., Hockett and Ferreira Bicho, 2000;
Santiago, 2004; Blasco and Fernández Peris, 2009; Rodríguez Loredo,
1997e1998; Cassoli and Tagliacozzo, 1997; Vigne and MarinvalVigne, 1983; Vigne et al., 1981; Blasco, 2008; Henshilwood, 1997;
Laroulandie, 2005b; Lloveras et al., 2009; Del Papa et al., 2010;
Medina and Pastor, in press; Pardiñas et al., 2011). Secondly, the
frequency of in situ and isolated broken incisor teeth in QR1 (toothbased NISP ¼ 463) resembled the pattern found in the cooking
experiment. Finally, the experimental assemblage resulted in the
susceptibility to fragmentation of the most damaged bones or the
affected portion of the bones, biasing its representation. Thus, the
absence of autopodium elements and some distal tibiae in QR1 could
be related to in situ burning damage-mediated decomposition
increased by long-term post-depositional processes (Smoke and
Stahl, 2004; Cain, 2005; Costamagno et al., 2005; Gifford, 1981;
Lyman, 1994; 2008; Stiner, 2005). The differential conservation also
explained the lower percentage of burned bones in QR1 (2,2%) from
the experimental sample (13,5%) where the traces of thermoalteration were crumbled by attritional mechanisms (Stiner et al., 1995).
Based on these results it is suggested that the small-mammal
assemblage of QR1 was primarily accumulated by human through
butchery, cooking and consumption related activities (Medina
et al., in press; Rivero et al. 2008e2009). This hypothesis is supported not only by the high occurrence of cut-marks and the
skeletal element representation (Table 1; see a complete description in Medina et al., in press), but also by the sediments rich in ash
and ash by-product, indicating multiple time-averaged cooking
events across the Holocene.
However, the experimental analogy may not fully contemplate
the past human burning-related behaviors despite similarities
(cf. O’Connell, 1995). For example, the rodent incisors of QR1 were
heavily transversely broken but not burned as in the analogical
records, or the damage did not penetrate the teeth deeply and was
difﬁcult to see at a macroscopical level. The high susceptibility to
disintegration of the damaged distal third of the incisors would also
explain this bias. On the other hand, the burned bones of QR1
included some elements that were unburned during the experiment, such as humeri and pelves. This archaeological pattern may
indicate that sometimes the preys were dismembered and cooked
separately or together with the rest of the carcass from which the
meatless parts of the extremities had been removed (Laroulandie,
2001, 2005b:173; Vigne et al., 1981). The presence of cut-marks in
burned bones (Table 1) reinforces this hypothesis, suggesting that
some skeletal elements were deﬂeshed or processed prior to
cooking. Moreover, the carbonized and calcined specimens show
that sometimes bones could have been thrown onto the ﬁre once
the meat and viscera had been removed or consumed. Finally, limbbones that according to the experimental model should be burned,
were not always damaged such as a high frequency of cavy tibiae.
This pattern suggests that occasionally the deﬂeshed meat was
cooked separately from the bone, the muscle mass was eaten
uncooked or the elements were cooked but the ﬁre not affected the
bone (Blasco and Fernández Peris, 2009).
The experimental model only contemplates a segment of the
taphonomic history of the small-vertebrate bone assemblage from
QR1. Most archaeological deposits such as QR1 were accumulated
along decades or thousands of years, averaging human behaviors
and multiple post-depositional processes at coarse-grain (Borrero,
1991; Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1984; Marean, 1995; Stiner, 1994). The
sum of generalizations obtained from short-term observation of
modern events may not fully describe the long-term consequence of
the same process (Stiner, 1994). Thus, the actualistic analogies must
be translated and scaled according to archaeological-scale

resolution, expanding the range of situations to understand the
fossil record and considering the variety of multidimensional variables that affected the deposits throughout their taphonomic
history (Borrero, 1991; O’Connell, 1995; Stiner, 1994).
The cooking experiment presented here plays a key role as
a methodological tool establishing causal relation among cooking
behaviors, the pattern of burning damage and the context which
generates them, providing an essential background for interpreting
the taphonomical history of the small-rodent and bird bones from
QR1. Extending this study to other archaeological sites in South
America may help to identify the prehistoric bone collectors of
these small-animals.
