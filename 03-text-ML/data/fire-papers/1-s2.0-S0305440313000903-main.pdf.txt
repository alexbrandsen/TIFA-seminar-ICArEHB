Because only a few radiometric data are actually available, the chronology of the Amudian e a bladedominated industry of the Acheulo-Yabrudian Cultural Complex (AYCC) of the late Lower Paleolithic in
the Levant e is still not well constrained. Qesem Cave offers the opportunity to enhance our knowledge
of the chronological position of this industry which is unique to the Levant. The Qesem Amudian bearing
layers yielded also human remains showing afﬁnities with those of modern populations recovered in the
Middle Paleolithic sites of Skhul and Qafzeh. The results presented here are the ﬁrst attempt to apply the
TL and ESR/U-series dating methods at this site and these methods yielded results which are generally in
agreement. They support a time interval of hominid-bearing occupation of the areas of the cave where
Amudian lithic artifacts were recovered during MIS 8 and likely 9 for the Deep Pit Area, and during MIS 8
and possibly 7 for the Upper part of the sequence (Square K/10 and the Eastern Microfauna-Bearing
Area). An older occupation of the cave is also conceivable on the base of two dating results (MIS 11).

1. Introduction
Connecting Africa and Eurasia, the Levant is naturally considered as a corridor which enabled human migrations during
Paleolithic times. At the end of the Lower Paleolithic period, the
Acheulo-Yabrudian Cultural Complex (AYCC) emerged in this region
where it remained conﬁned. This cultural complex is thus known in
a limited series of sites, from which the most famous is probably the
Tabun Cave e Mount Carmel e (Garrod and Bate, 1937). At Tabun,
the chronology of the AYCC industries has been questioned for a
long time (Grün and Stringer, 2000) but the last series of dates
seems to indicate that this cultural complex could be older than
260 ka in this site (Mercier and Valladas, 2003). Additional chronological results gave also indications about the antiquity of this
cultural complex as, for example, the U-series dating of a ﬂowstone
covering the Acheulo-Yabrudian layers discovered at Jamal Cave
(Weinstein-Evron et al., 1999), or the thermoluminescence dates
obtained for the Early Levantine Middle Paleolithic (‘Tabun D-type’

industry) at Hayonim Cave (Mercier et al., 2007), which post-date
the Acheulo-Yabrudian industries.
The AYCC includes three major lithic industries: AcheuloYabrudian dominated by handaxes and Quina scrapers; Yabrudian
dominated by Quina scrapers; and Amudian dominated by blades.
The blade-dominated Amudian industry of the AYCC is consistently
present at Qesem Cave while the Quina, scraper-dominated, Yabrudian industry appears in stratigraphically distinct units in two
areas of the cave (Barkai et al., 2009). The Amudian lithic assemblages show a very early and well established blade production
technology, systematically used for the serial production of predetermined laminar items (Shimelmitz et al., 2011). Blades in small
numbers do appear in Yabrudian assemblages, and were made by
Amudian blade-production standards. Scrapers, including Quina
scrapers, are dominant in Yabrudian tool assemblages but appear in
small numbers in Amudian assemblages too. Taking into account
the spatial patterning of the lithic ﬁnds, the two lithic industries at
Qesem Cave seem to represent activity areas rather than distinct
groups or traditions (see Barkai et al., 2009 for more details).
Qesem Cave is one of the rare sites which provided exclusively
Acheuleo-Yabrudian ﬁnds clearly dominated by the Amudian

industry (Barkai et al., 2003, 2005; Gopher et al., 2005; Shimelmitz
et al., 2011), and thus offers the opportunity to enhance our
knowledge of this very early blade industry and precise its chronological position. Moreover, the Qesem Amudian bearing layers
yielded also human dental remains showing afﬁnities with those of
modern populations recovered in the Middle Paleolithic sites of
Skhul and Qafzeh (Hershkovitz et al., 2011).
1.1. General presentation of the cave
Qesem Cave is situated 12 km east of the Mediterranean coast of
Tel Aviv (Fig. 1) in a hilly limestone terrain. The cave is a sedimentﬁlled chamber estimated at w20  15 m in size and w10 m high
(Gopher et al., 2005) although a larger and deeper chamber yet to
be excavated was recently uncovered. Since the discovery in 2000,
ongoing excavation has exposed w9.5 m of deposits containing
sediments of natural and anthropogenic origins. The stratigraphical
sequence is divided into two parts : the lower (w5.5 m thick) was
deposited in a closed karstic chamber, while the upper part
(w4.5 m thick) was deposited when the cave was more open as
indicated by the presence of calciﬁed rootlets (Karkanas et al.,
2007). Today, the roof of the cave is missing in its entirety due to
road construction (Fig. 2) and just the inﬁlling and the wall of the
cave are exposed. It is probable that only parts of the roof, on top of
the rock shelf and the upper area (N-Q/8-12) survived and were
destroyed by road construction.
The nature of the rich lithic and faunal assemblages, supported
by a plethora of U-series dates (Barkai et al., 2003; Gopher et al.,
2010) indicates that the inﬁlling sequence corresponds to Middle
Pleistocene deposits. These deposits were continuously affected
since their deposition by recurring subsidence, erosion, and

possibly fracturing or cracking changing the cave’s shape, and
ﬁnally acting as post-depositional agents (Frumkin et al., 2009). As
indicated by the presence of ashes, the use of ﬁre is attested all
along the sequence and micromorphological studies indicate that
ﬁre was more intensively used in the upper part of the sequence
than in the lower part (Karkanas et al., 2007). As a consequence,
numerous burnt ﬂints (Lemorini et al., 2006) and bones (Stiner
et al., 2009, 2011) were discovered in the various deposits.
The lithic assemblages of the cave are dominated by the Amudian blade industry of the AYCC (Gopher et al., 2005, 2010; Barkai
et al., 2005, 2009; Shimelmitz et al., 2011). This complex refers to
the chrono-cultural entity postdating the Lower Paleolithic
Acheulian, predating the Middle Paleolithic Mousterian and corresponds to Jelinek’s “Mugharan Tradition” (Jelinek, 1981, 1992).
Another lithic industry of the AYCC is the scraper-dominated Yabrudian that appears at Qesem Cave in three stratigraphically and
spatially distinct areas (Barkai et al., 2009; Lev, 2010).
The Amudian industry is characterized by systematic blade
production (Shimelmitz et al., 2011), and many of the tools were
made on blades, including backed and retouched blades, burins,
end scrapers and especially abundant naturally backed knives. A
ﬂake component also exists in the Amudian, and side scrapers
appear in variable, generally low frequencies (Barkai et al., 2005;
Gopher et al., 2005; Barkai et al., 2009). Handaxes are rare at Qesem
Cave and only a few were found in Amudian layers. Use-wear
analysis of the Amudian assemblages documented the
outstanding state of preservation of the ﬂint items and indicated
that butchering was the main activity at the site (Lemorini et al.,
2006). Carcasses were processed mainly with blade cutting tools
(knives) used speciﬁcally for skinning, disarticulation, and cutting
meat while a speciﬁc type of recycled, double-ventral ﬂakes was
used for cutting meat too (Barkai et al., 2010). The Yabrudian industry shows signiﬁcantly lower frequencies of blades compared to
the Amudian and is dominated by Quina scrapers (up to 50% of the
shaped tools). Yabrudian has hitherto been found in three distinct
and limited areas in the cave; one under a rock shelf in the central
part of the cave (elevations 560e600 cm below datum), one in the
southwestern part of the cave (elevations ca. 600e630 cm below
datum), and one by the eastern wall of the cave (elevations 130e
150 cm below datum) and they all appear to be contemporaneous,
in the sense of ﬁeld relations, to adjacent Amudian contexts.
The faunal assemblages of the site are dominated by fallow deer
but other species such as auroch (Bos), horse (Equus), wild pig (Sus),
red deer (Cervus) and tortoise (Testudo) are present. Mostly primeaged fallow deers were hunted and selected body parts were
transported into the cave. Cut marks and burning signs were found

N. Mercier et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 40 (2013) 3011e3020

on quite an impressive number of the bones (Stiner et al., 2009,
2011) bearing indications of butchering and marrow extraction.
The presence of bones in clear association with indications of human activities, the patterns of body part selection and transportation, the large scale of human manipulation (cutting,
fracturing, burning, marrow extraction) and the lack of evidence for
non-anthropogenic accumulation argue in favor of a faunal
assemblage that was brought to the cave by humans.
A study of human dental remains (Hershkovitz et al., 2011)
indicated that the hominins inhabiting Qesem Cave were not Homo
erectus but rather most similar to later modern populations (e.g.
Skhul/Qafzeh) of this region, notwithstanding some Neanderthal
afﬁnities as well. Based on a newly developed bio-energetic model
it was recently suggested that dietary stress in the Middle Pleistocene Levant caused by the disappearance of elephants triggered
the demise of H. erectus who was highly dependent on very large
animals. Those in the population better adapted to the new diet
constraints e namely hunting larger numbers of smaller and faster
animals in order to provide sufﬁcient caloric intake to compensate
for the loss of the elephants e indicate the appearance of a new
hominin lineage (Ben-Dor et al., 2011). This suggestion is consistent
with the recently published innovative model for the evolution of
Pleistocene human populations of Europe (Bermúdez de Castro and
Martinón-Torres, 2012) suggesting the Levant as a Central Area of
Dispersals of Eurasia (CADE), an “origin region” for human species
biodiversity.

sequence readily exposed and available in summers 2004 and 2005
(Fig. 3). The results of this stage are presented here but future TL/
ESR dating stages are underway and will be devoted to speciﬁc
areas of the cave and speciﬁc contexts (like contexts where human
teeth were found, constructed hearths, etc.) and to the resolution of
speciﬁc questions (sedimentation rate, chronological correspondence of Yabrudian and Amudian activity areas, etc.).
2.1. Context of the dated samples
Sampling and dosimetry for the TL and ESR/U-series dating
project started in 2004. The rescue excavation in 2001 reached
bedrock in the southern part of the cave which was reﬁlled and
covered by the new road soon after the excavation. Thus no access
to the southern lower part of the caves’ sequence was possible
when resuming excavations in 2004. The samples presented in this
paper are thus mainly from the top 1.5 m of the lower stratigraphic
sequence of the cave and the bottom/middle parts of the upper
stratigraphic sequence. The top 2.5 m of the upper sequence as well
as the deepest 2.5 m of the lower sequence (known to date) were
not dated yet.
Three major areas were studied and sampled for TL and ESR/Useries dating:

2. TL and ESR/U-series dating

1). Square K/10 at elevations 375e415 cm below datum is situated
in the central part of the cave (Fig. 3). Only half of square K/10
was excavated in 2001 showing part of a thick (40e50 cm)
archaeological palimpsest of soft, dark-brown sediments with a
very dense concentration of ﬂint artifacts and animal bones.
This unit is sandwiched, top and bottom, by cemented sediments. It is a stratigraphically clear context and quite distinct.
2). The Eastern Microfauna-Bearing Area is located in squares LM-N/13-14-15 where rich assemblages of micromammal and
reptile bones were recovered from archaeological horizons at
elevations 320e545 cm. The area is close to the original eastern
wall of the cave and includes the lower part of the upper
sequence. The sediments appear in different shades of brown;
they are generally soft with small angular or sub- rounded
stones and include at least three inclined thin horizons of dark
brown to black sediment starting at elevation 430 in the east
and reaching elevation 495 in the west (Fig. 4). The inclined
beds continue to the west and reach square H-13 of the Deep Pit
thus revealing a direct connection between the upper and
lower sequences (Fig. 3). A deeper look at the sediments and
formation processes in the lower part of this area was provided
by a detailed micromorphological study of a 25 cm thick sediments block, collected in square L/14 (nearby the teeth sampled
for ESR/U-series) and slightly deeper (between elevations 495
and 520 cm). This block belongs to the uppermost part of the
Lower sequence based on sedimentological and depositional
considerations (Karkanas et al., 2007; Maul et al., 2011).
3). The Deep Pit Area in the present central part of the cave was
originally excavated as the ‘Deep Sounding’ in 2001 (two square
meters). The area suffered a collapse of sediments due to the
heavy rains of winter 2001 and has thus been enlarged in
2004e2006 (Fig. 3). Since 2008 this area is re-excavated in the
hope of reaching bedrock again. In this paper we thus relate to
the Deep Pit Area, sampled for TL and ESR/U-series in 2004e
2006, as a stratigraphic context not fully understood that seems
to have witnessed rather signiﬁcant post depositional processes
as it is located at the center of the main chamber of the cave

The ﬁrst stage of this TL and ESR/U-series dating project was
largely devoted to an attempt in deﬁning the chronological range of
the cave deposits and thus, samples were taken in all parts of the

All sediments of the Deep Pit Area belong to the Lower Sequence
except for a brownish layer at the top of the Deep Pit stratigraphy
that belongs to the Upper Sequence of the cave. This includes a

1.2. Previous chronological studies
The absolute/radiometric dating project of Qesem Cave was
designed to include two major aspects based on the availability of
potential samples in the cave. One line of work was directed toward
the dating of speleothems present on-site by way of its being a
karstic system that was active for a long time. Speleothems were
sampled from various parts of the cave and dated by the U-series
method. The ﬁrst series of 230Th/234U dates suggested that the
occupation of the cave began around 380 ka and ended possibly
around 200 ka (Barkai et al., 2003). A later project of U-series dating
concluded that the human occupation started sometime around
420 ka and ended shortly before 200 ka (Gopher et al., 2010). In
some cases, dated speleothems enabled offering dates for speciﬁc
contexts: for example, sample QE-06-1 is a speleothem crust found
under the eastern part of a rock shelf and it has been shown,
following micromorphological analysis, that it is a pure speleothem
formed in situ on top of unreworked sediments. The speleothem
itself showed no signs of dissolution or re-precipitation and yielded
an age of 299 þ 30/30 ka which is therefore a minimum age for
the 5.5 m of the sediment sequence below it. As indicated by this
example, speleothems are formed naturally and consequently, they
need to be related to the human presence and activities in the cave
by inference.
In order to overcome this limitation, a second line of work was
to get dates from burnt ﬂints and animal teeth both of which were
clearly brought into the cave by the inhabitants and are thus
directly related to human activities. The dating methods applied to
these samples, i.e. Thermoluminescence e TL e to burnt ﬂints, and
combined Electron Spin Resonance and U-series methods e ESR/Useries e to teeth, are then major to establish the chronology of
Qesem Cave and their results constitute the topic of this paper.

stony unit consisting of limestone boulders in the western and
eastern sections of the Deep Pit which is almost two meters thick in
the west. The deposition of the limestone boulder unit is not clear
yet, but to our best understanding at the moment it might represent a major pile of stones that accumulated at the center of the
cave, a process well known at aging karstic caves (e.g. Frumkin
et al., 2009). The micromorphological study based on relevant
sediment samples taken in 2004 and 2005 (Karkanas et al., 2007)
shows, amongst other things, ﬁne charcoal fragments and burnt
bones as well as in situ undisturbed burnt layers with recrystalized
wood ash (i.e. hearths) in the western section of the Deep Pit which
is clearly an in situ deposition. The observed features suggest that
the area of deposition was rather inside a humid closed karstic
environment (see also Frumkin et al., 2009).

2.2. Dating methodology
In this study the TL and ESR/U-series methods were applied to
burnt ﬂints and herbivorous teeth, respectively. These methods rely
on dosimetric measurements performed on these materials but
share dosimetric information related to the environment of the
samples. In the following are presented the environmental dose
rates determined in situ for the three above mentioned areas.
The environmental dose rates were measured by inserting
artiﬁcial dosimeters in the sediments. A total of ca. 50 dosimeters
was planted in the different layers and stayed in place for at least
one year, recording the gamma and cosmic rays. In Table S1
(Supplementary Data) are given the gamma dose-rates deduced
after subtracting the current cosmic dose-rate for the dosimeters

relevant to the dated samples (ﬂints and teeth). The gamma doserate values vary from ca. 180 to 460 mGy/a, and these variations
seem dependent on the areas. In square K/10, the dose-rate values
vary from 310 to 460 mGy/a, with 4 out of 5 values below 380 mGy/a.
In the lower part of the Deep Pit Area the distribution of the dose
rates is more heterogenous, varying from 178 to 412 mGy/a. These
variations can be explained by the presence of numerous limestone
blocks of different sizes in the sediment. Indeed, limestone has a
very low U content compared to that of clay. Moreover, limestone
blocks of different sizes are randomly distributed within the sediments of the Deep Pit and the western rim of this area consists of an
almost solid unit of limestone boulders (Fig. 4): all these heterogeneities make the evaluation of the gamma dose-rate received
from each sample particularly difﬁcult to estimate.
The doses measured with the dosimeters were used for estimating the gamma dose-rate to which each sample, be it a ﬂint or a
tooth, was exposed. On Fig. 3 are given the location of the samples
(ﬂints and teeth) and dosimeters.
2.2.1. The thermoluminescence (TL) dating method
Numerous ﬂint artefacts showing marks of past heating have
been recovered all along the archaeological sequence enabling the
application of the Thermoluminescence (TL) dating method. Flint is
actually well known as a good natural dosimeter recording all doses
to which it is exposed. The TL method, which was successfully
applied to several Near-Eastern archaeological sites (Valladas et al.,

1987, 1988, 1998; Mercier et al., 1995a,b; Mercier and Valladas,
2003), allows the determination of the time elapsed since the
sample has reached in the past a temperature in excess of w400  C.
Heating of a ﬂint was likely accidental, taking place in the habitually
used ﬁreplaces spread throughout the cave’s sequence, but it lead
to the zeroing of the dose previously recorded in its crystal lattice.
Estimating the dose newly accumulated since this past heating
(zeroing) event, called the Paleodose or Equivalent Dose (ED), one
can evaluate this time period given that, in parallel, the total doserate, i.e. the sum of all doses absorbed by the sample in one year,
can be accurately determined.
2.2.1.1. Samples selection and preparation. Fifty six ﬂint samples
showing marks of past heating were selected and preliminary TL
measurements were performed to check if they had been sufﬁciently heated in the past for totally zeroing their geological TL
signal. The forty specimens that passed this test successfully were
prepared following the procedure described by Valladas (1992)
which ﬁrst consists in cutting each ﬂint with a diamond saw in
order to isolate its internal part. This procedure aims at selecting a
volume of sample not irradiated by alpha and beta particles coming
from the surrounding sediments, which are radiative components
difﬁcult to estimate with reliability. The internal fraction of the ﬂint
is generally used for TL measurements and radioisotope analyses.
However, the examination of the ﬂint cut sections indicated that
some of them, like QS9 and QS48b, are made of blotches of different

3016

N. Mercier et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 40 (2013) 3011e3020

colors (gray and white) which are suspected to have radioelement
contents signiﬁcantly different from each other (Selo et al., 2009).
We then tried to isolate a homogenous part by eliminating all
visible colored blotches. After crushing this part, a fraction of the
powder was sampled for Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) in order to determine the radioelement contents e in uranium (U),
thorium (Th) and potassium (K) e of the specimen. These radioisotopes induce what is called the internal dose-rate, mainly due to
alpha and beta particles originating from the ﬂint itself. To check
the impact of a possible heterogenous distribution of U within a
sample, different grain sizes were measured for seven ﬂints.
Table S2 (supplementary data) shows that the U contents obtained
on the different fractions are within 10 for all the samples tested
(total of 7 specimen) except for the heterogenous samples QS9 and
QS48b which exhibits variations by a factor 3 and are particularly
critical because such large variations can induce differences in the
TL properties.
For TL measurements, the 100e160 mm fraction was selected by
sieving and then chemically treated with HCl and rinsed with
distilled water. After drying, the powder was divided in subsamples which were irradiated with a calibrated Cs-137 source
(dose-rate: w1.17 Gy/min; Valladas, 1978). The measurement of the
induced TL signals was done with a home-made TL equipment
(Valladas et al., 1994), with a heating rate of 5 /sec, and the UV-blue
component of the emission spectrum was selected with appropriate optical ﬁlters (MTO 380 nm). These measurements allowed
to determine the variations of the TL signal as a function of the
absorbed dose, and for each sample, the Equivalent Dose was then
calculated following a standard procedure (Mercier et al., 1992),
after checking that the plateau test, which allows characterizing the
efﬁciency of the past heating in zeroing any previous dose, was
passed.
Additional experiments were performed for determining the
relative efﬁciency of alpha to beta particles in inducing a TL signal.
This was done in irradiating different aliquots of each sample with
either beta rays, from a Sr-90 source, or alpha rays, from a Am-241
source (Valladas and Valladas, 1982).
2.2.2. The combined ESR/U-series dating method
The combined ESR/U-series method (ESR-US model), taking into
account both ESR and U-series data including radioelement contents, isotopic ratios, equivalent doses and external gamma-dose
rate, allows the reconstruction of the history of uranium uptake
in each dental tissue using a one parameter (p-value) diffusion
equation (Grün et al., 1988). Its application to herbivorous teeth
(Bahain et al., 1992; Grün, 2009) implies consideration on the
evolution of the dose-rate over time according to the post-mortem
uranium incorporation through the calculation of a speciﬁc U-uptake parameter (p-parameter) for each dental tissue, except for
samples showing evidence of uranium loss. Such a combined
approach is based on a single age model for each tooth analyzed.
The dose rates originating from the different tissues constituting
the tooth and the deduced age estimate depend strongly on the
modeling of the uranium uptake rate that occurred over the burial
history of the sample. Different models describing different Uincorporation kinetics had been proposed earlier to calculate ESR
ages, such as the early uptake (EU) and linear uptake (LU) models
(Bischoff and Rosenbauer, 1981; Ikeya, 1982), but the ESR-US
approach allows a more detailed description of the uranium
incorporation, and thus a better estimation of the age (Falguères
et al., 1997; Grün et al., 1998).
2.2.2.1. Samples selection and preparation. Among the thirteen
herbivorous teeth initially selected, seven showed a good state of
preservation and were prepared for analyses. The samples (four

bovid teeth, two horse ones and one of Rhino) come from two
different sections in the site. Two teeth QS0504 and QS0505 were
sampled in square M/14, between 475 and 485 cm below datum.
The ﬁve other samples (QS0502, 0503, 0507, 0508, 0510) were
taken in an area where the majority of the analyzed burnt ﬂints
were found (Fig. 3).
The dental tissues (enamel, dentine, and cement when present)
of each tooth were separated and cleaned mechanically using a
dentist drill. Enamel was then ground, and sieved. Nine enamel
aliquots (about 100 mg each) of the 100e200 mm grain-size fraction
were irradiated respectively with doses of 200, 320, 500, 800, 1250,
2000, 3200, 5000, 8000 Gy, using a calibrated Co-60 source (IBL
gamma source, LNHB, CEN Saclay). ESR-signal intensities of irradiated and natural aliquots were measured with an EMX Bruker Xband spectrometer, with the following measurement conditions:
10 mW microwave power, 0.1 mT amplitude modulation, 10 mT
scan range, 80 ms time constant, 100 kHz modulation frequency.
Each measurement was repeated 3 times. The equivalent doses DE
were determined from the asymmetric enamel signal at g ¼ 2.0018
by the additive method, using an exponential ﬁtting (Grün, 1989;
Yokoyama et al., 1985).
U-series analyses were made for each dental tissue. Samples
(between 0.1 and 3 g) were dissolved in HNO3, and spiked with
232 228
U/ Th. U and Th were ﬁrstly separated using an anion exchange resin column (Dowex 1  8; 100e200 mesh) in HCl-form.
The separated fractions of U and Th were then puriﬁed with a
UTEVA resin column and a second anion exchange resin column,
respectively. Prior to the analysis of U and Th using alpha-ray
spectrometry, the two elements were extracted by TTA/benzene
solution and deposited on steel discs.
ESR-US ages were calculated with the ESR-DATA program (Grün,
2009), using an alpha efﬁciency of 0.13  0.02 according to Grün
and Katzenberger-Apel (1994), and Monte-Carlo beta attenuation
factors based on the thickness of the tooth enamel and outer layers
removed (Marsh et al., 2002). In addition, water content was estimated to be 3 wt% in the enamel and 7 wt% in the dentine and
cement. The environmental (external gamma and cosmic) dose
rates were deduced from the analysis of the TL dosimeters.
Gamma-ray spectrometry was used to determine the radioelements (U, Th and K) contents of sediments in which the teeth were
collected and the external beta dose rate to which the dental tissues
had been subjected was calculated according to Adamiec and
Aitken (1998). In measuring these sediment samples, no signiﬁcant disequilibrium in the U-series was detected. The effect of Ra
and Rn loss in each tissue was determined by combining the alpharay and gamma-ray data (Bahain et al., 1992).
2.3. Dating results
The dating results (Table 1 with TL ages, 2 and 3 with ESR-US
data) are displayed in four batches on Fig. 5, starting with samples of the mid upper sequence (elevations 375e415 below datum;
TL ages) from Square K/10, followed by the dates from the Eastern
Microfauna-Bearing Area in the lower part of the upper sequence
(elevations 475e485 cm below datum; ESR-US ages), and ﬁnally
the Deep Pit Area (TL and ESR-US ages) in two batches e one in
which samples come from the upper part of the Deep Pit (upper
part of the lower sequence, elevations 560e660 cm below datum)
and a second, for samples from the mid lower sequence (elevations
660e750 cm below datum).
2.3.1. Square K/10
The 8 selected burnt ﬂints from Square K/10 have been found at
elevations between 375 and 415 cm below datum, and yielded
consistent ages. For this set of samples, the environmental dose-

rate is w400 mGy/a, typical of an environment enriched in limestone fragments and poor in clay (Mercier et al., 1995b). In contrast
to this homogenous dosimetry, these samples show very different
U contents, ranging from 0.16 to 3.11 ppm, which generate internal
dose-rates between w80 and 1512 mGy/a. The corresponding
equivalent doses DE are correlated to these internal dose-rates,
showing also large differences (from w143 to 412 Gy). This good
correlation leads to consistent TL ages (Table 1) indicating the
reliability of these individual results: from them, a mean age of
257  20 ka was obtained after sample QS9 was discarded because

of its U distribution heterogeneity (Table S2). Square K/10 yielded a
rich blade-dominated Amudian industry (Barkai et al., 2009;
Shimelmitz et al., 2011) and a use wear study of the industry has
shown that blades were used mainly for meat cutting (Lemorini
et al., 2006). These results indicate that the material unearthed
from Square K/10 should be attributed to MIS 8 and possibly to the
beginning of MIS7.
2.3.2. The Eastern Microfauna-Bearing Area
Two teeth QS0504 and QS0505 from Square M/14 at elevations
475e485 cm below datum, some 60e70 cm below the lower
elevation of the dated ﬂints from Square K/10 were dated. As for Useries dates from the sample Q6 ﬂowstone (see Gopher et al., 2010),
they exhibit an uranium content ranging between 4.2 and 7.6 ppm
in enamel and w75 ppm in dentine which is higher than the U
concentration observed in the other teeth (except QS0508)
(Table 2).
Even though these two samples show very different U-series
and ESR data, they yielded similar ages if we take into account the
associated uncertainties (Table 3). QS0505 has an DE three times
higher than that of QS0504. A signiﬁcant difference in the internal
dose is also observed mainly due to the great difference of uranium content in the two teeth. Similarly, the isotopic ratios are
different and range between 0.7 (dentine) and 0.9 (enamel) for
230
Th/234U. The calculated ages (280 þ 40/37 and 252  18 ka)
are similar in spite of these different data expressed by p-values
between 0 (linear uptake, LU) and 1 (early uptake, EU) for
QS0505 and by a recent uranium uptake (p-values > 0) for
QS0504. These results are statistically rather similar to those obtained on the 8 burnt ﬂint samples of Square K/10, despite the
difference of elevation (w60 cm), and should also be attributed to
MIS 8. The Eastern Microfauna Bearing Area yielded a bladedominated Amudian industry (Barkai et al., 2009; Shimelmitz
et al., 2011) as well as a rich assemblage of micromammals and
reptiles (Maul et al., 2011). Two human teeth were found in this
area in Square M/13 at elevation 360e370 cm below datum
(Hershkovitz et al., 2011).

2.3.3. The upper part of the Deep Pit Area
For burnt ﬂints coming from the upper part of the Deep Pit Area,
at a depth between 560 and 635 cm below datum, TL ages (Table 1)
are highly scattered (from w200 to w420 ka). One can however
notice that 5 of the 8 samples yielded ages between 235  26 and
285  32 ka, quite close to the previously presented ages. Two of
the other three samples (i.e. QS31a & QS48b) have apparent relatively young ages (w200 ka) but they showed white and gray zonations which were difﬁcult to remove during preparation. Yet,
Neutron Activation Analyses (NAA) performed on samples showing
this kind of zonation (Table S2, supplementary data) had indicated
that these zones may have different U contents, with variations up
to a factor of 3, from w1 to w3 ppm (Selo et al., 2009). In consequence, it has been suspected that the determined U content is not
fully representative of the fraction used for TL analyses. Thus, in
calculating mean ages, these two results (indicated with star in
Table 1) have been discarded. Most interesting is the case of sample
QS30 (depth 560e565) which gave an age of 421  38 ka. As this
sample was homogenous, zonation is not suspected and its U
content (0.61 ppm) remains on the average of most of other samples. Consequently, the only possibility for this sample to have an
age close to the other ones (w270 ka) is to suppose that its external
dose-rate was w800 mGy/a. However, such a high external doserate is not realistic at Qesem Cave because of the nature of the
sediment (dominated by limestone blocks and fragments in these
layers). Moreover, no dosimeter recorded such a high value (see
Table S1). Therefore, the possibility remains that this heated artifact is not in its original location and comes from an older occupation of the cave. We can only speculate how this ﬂint item
reached the position in which it was found: it may have been
retrieved in the past from its original context or discarded before

being reused or recycled, a phenomenon well represented
throughout the layers of the cave (e.g. Barkai et al., 2010), or it was
displaced by post depositional processes. Whatever the reason is,
this sample yielded the oldest TL date; it is interesting to notice that
this result is identical to the oldest date obtained for the U-series
(Gopher et al., 2010) and close to the one obtained by ESR-US on
QS0503 (388 þ 23/22 ka). In discarding unreliable samples (i.e.
QS31a and QS48b) as well as QS30 because of its surprising great
age, a mean TL age of 261  16 ka (corresponding to MIS 8) is obtained for the Upper part of the Deep Pit Area.
ESR/U-series analyses have also been performed on 4 teeth
(QS0502, QS0503, QS0507, QS0508) found in this area. These teeth
have been discovered at elevations ranging between 570 and
630 cm below datum. Except for QS0508, the U content is quite
similar in the teeth ranging between 0.85 and 1.18 ppm in enamel
and between 22 and 42 ppm in dentine and cement tissues. QS0508
exhibits a U-content which is 10 times higher in the enamel and 2e
4 times higher in the dentine than that observed in the other
samples. These high concentrations lead to an annual dose value 5
times higher and an De 2 or 3 times higher compared to that of the
other samples. QS0508 is the only sample presenting a 234U/238U
ratio >1. The other samples exhibit a 234U loss (or 238U excess?)
which can reach 10% versus the QS0508 isotopic ratio. These data
suggest that the teeth underwent a complex geochemical history
with probably a U-leaching followed by a very recent uptake which
occurred in all the teeth including QS0508 as proven by the pvalues (all greater than 1) and resulting in scattered ages ranging
from w225 to w388 ka. Because of this complex history, these last
results are considered to be only indicative of the time range.
Taken as a whole, most of the selected TL and ESR/U-series results obtained for samples from the Upper part of the Deep Pit Area,

except two results (QS0503: 388 þ 23/22 ka and QS30:
421  38 ka), can be attributed to MIS 8, as it was the case for
samples from Square K10 and the Eastern Microfauna Bearing Area.
But as indicated by Fig. 5, these dates do not correlate with the
depth.
2.3.4. The lower part of the Deep Pit Area
The 8 burnt ﬂints from the lower part of the Deep Pit
(depth > 660 cm below datum) come from Squares H/14 and I/16,
on the east side of this pit, and from Squares F/13d and F/15d, on the
west side. The environmental dose-rates recorded by the dosimeters are relatively low but they are scattered, ranging from w312 to
444 mGy/a. This spread is observed at the scale of one square meter :
for instance in Square I/16, dose-rates of 312 and 409 mGy/a were
measured for depths of 660 and 690 cm, respectively. This variability could be explained as already noted by the presence of
blocks of limestone which are almost free of radioactivity, as
opposed to ﬁne sediments present between these blocks where the
dosimeters could be inserted.
The TL ages are also relatively scattered in this sector, varying
from 204  19 to 308  43 ka, even though 5 samples out of 8
provided ages older than 242 ka. Two of the other three samples,
QS41a and QS41b, have very low radioelement contents, and have
therefore relatively low internal dose-rates (<170 mGy/a). Their
apparent ages are consequently signiﬁcantly dependent on the
environmental dose-rates used for calculation. If the dosimetric
environment of these pieces (deﬁned as a sphere of w30 cm of
radius in which gamma rays are generated by the decay of radioelements) was relatively rich in limestone, the external doserate to which these samples have been exposed was certainly
lower than the value recorded by the closest dosimeter. For
instance, one can easily show that if samples QS41a and QS41b
had received an external dose-rate equal to the lowest dose-rate
measured in this sector, i.e. 312 mGy/a, their apparent ages
would be w275 and w279 ka, respectively, indiscernible to the
ages of the other 5 samples. Even though one has no reason to
prefer one external dose-rate over another, this simple calculation
indicates how sensitive the apparent ages of these two samples
are. On the contrary, sample QS54 has a relatively high U content,
in comparison to most of the other samples (1.46 ppm) leading to
an internal dose-rate almost twice the value of the external doserate. The age of this sample (204  19 ka) is therefore less
dependent on a misﬁt between the estimated external dose-rate
and the value it actually received during burial. Without considering the two samples QS41a and QS41b, a mean TL age of
264  36 ka is obtained for the set of samples found at a depth
greater than 660 cm.
Only one tooth (QS0510) coming from the lower part of the
Deep Pit, found at elevations 700e705 cm below datum was
available for combined ESR/U-series analyses. Among all the
considered samples, this rhino tooth exhibits the lower uranium
content in its tissues (0.18 ppm for enamel and 11.24 ppm for
dentine). The isotopic ratios are comprised between 1.15 and
1.17 for 234U/238U and between 0.97 and 0.77 for 230Th/234U, for
enamel and dentine tissues respectively. The annual dose is low
compared to some teeth found in the pit at a little higher
elevation. P-values range between 0 and 1 (0.40 and 0.98
for enamel and dentine respectively) and yielded an age of
326 þ 20/18 ka. It then falls in the time range covered by the
TL ages (see Fig. 5) which are, as in the Upper part of the Deep
Pit Area, not ordered by depth, probably indicating stratigraphic
disturbances. However, considering the dating results obtained
for the Upper part of the Deep Pit Area, it seems likely that
the Lower part of this area can be correlated to MIS 8 and
possibly 9.

3. Discussion
When looking at the results after the selection process has been
made (Fig. 5), it seems that the TL and ESR/U-series ages increase
with depth in the upper part of the sequence (i.e. Square K/10 and
the Eastern Microfauna-Bearing Area), ranging from 217  35 to
289  25 ka and from 283 þ 40/37 to 252  18 ka, respectively.
Two dates inversions exist however if we do not consider at ﬁrst
sight the associated uncertainties : one explanation could be that
local disturbances affected the sediments, moving for instance a
piece vertically, but it is more likely that these inversions which are
of the same order than the individual age uncertainties (w25e
30 ka), are related to the difﬁculty in estimating the dosimetric
parameters. Consequently, for the sake of the discussion here, one
has to consider the results obtained in an area as a whole and then
deﬁne the time range covered by the dates. Following this remark,
the results shown in Fig. 5 indicate that the sediments of Square K/
10 and the Eastern Microfauna-Bearing Area were likely deposited
during MIS 8. However, considering the uncertainties associated
with the TL and ESR/U-series individual results and even though
the two dated samples recovered in the Eastern MicrofaunaBearing Area came from a greater depth, it is too early to
conclude that the sediments were deposited in this area a long time
before those of Square K/10.
For the Upper and Lower part of the Deep Pit Area, all results
except two are in the w200e350 ka time interval, and do not seem
to increase with depth. Nevertheless, looking at the results distribution and considering the conclusions drawn for Square K10 and
for the Eastern Microfauna Bearing Area, this suggests that the
more likely time interval for deposition of the sediments from the
Upper and Lower parts of the Deep Pit is MIS 8, and possibly 9. One
has also to consider the two results which gave ages greater than
w350 ka, possibly indicating an older occupation of the site during
MIS 11 or 10. The location of these samples in the Upper Part of the
Deep Pit Area remains questionable and the above mentioned
stratigraphic problems identiﬁed in this area need to be tackled.
Considering the chronological available database for Lower
Paleolithic Acheulian in the Levant that predates the AYCC and the
earliest dates available for the Middle Paleolithic Mousterian,
postdating the AYCC (see discussion in Gopher et al., 2010 and
references therein), the results obtained in this study provide
further support on the attribution of the AYCC to MIS 8 and 9, thus
positioning the end of the Lower Paleolithic in this region. The fact
that the distinct Amudian industry appears all along the Qesem
Cave sequence and the fact that the Yabrudian industry is known in
different parts of the stratigraphy from top (at elevation 130e
150 cm below datum), through elevations 560e600 cm below datum, and somewhat deeper in a newly excavated area in Squares BE/15-16 (reaching elevation 630 cm below datum) supports the
suggestion that these two industries of the AYCC would be
contemporaneous at Qesem Cave.
4. Conclusion
The application of the TL and ESR/U-series dating methods at
Qesem Cave allowed, despite the various problems discussed
above, to obtain results which are generally in agreement. These
new chronological data support a time interval of hominid-bearing
occupation at the cave, likely during MIS 8 (and possibly at the
beginning of MIS7) for the Upper part of the sequence (Square K/10
and Eastern Microfauna-Bearing Area) and MIS 8 and likely 9 for
the Deep Pit Area. An older occupation of the cave before MIS 8-9 is
also conceivable on the base of two dating results (MIS 11-10). This
time interval is therefore similar with those deﬁned on the basis of
the U-series dates obtained at Qesem Cave (Gopher et al., 2010 and

3020

N. Mercier et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 40 (2013) 3011e3020

references therein) suggesting no time gap between the growth of
speleothems and the occupation period. Moreover, since w2.5 m of
sediments above the highest dated samples and over 2.5 m of
sediments below the deepest dated samples were not dated yet, the
range of dates presented in this paper correlates to the middle part
of the human occupation at the cave.
In the future, the application of the ESR/U-series and TL dating
methods to ﬂints and animal teeth that have been brought into the
cave at least as early as 420 ka, will probably contribute to reﬁne the
chronology of the Acheuleo-Yabrudian Cultural Complex and of the
human remains found at the cave, and to precise the time duration
during which the Amudian and Yabrudian industries were
produced.
