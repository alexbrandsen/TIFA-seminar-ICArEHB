Generally speaking, charcoal analysis is based on identifying and counting charcoal fragments in order to
calculate the relative variations in taxa frequency. All post-depositional processes are likely to induce
fragmentation of the anthracological material, raising the question of the representativeness of taxa.
Based on an innovative experimental approach combining both charcoal analysis and biomechanics, this
paper explores how the mechanical properties of charcoal can inﬂuence the fragmentation and the
quantiﬁcation of species in anthracological assemblages. We carried out standardized laboratory
compression tests on 302 samples issued from 10 taxa, charred at three different temperatures, in order
to characterize the mechanical properties of common species in temperate and Mediterranean Europe.
Our results highlight the differential responses of the tested species in terms of resistance to compression
and fragmentation, two processes which do not appear to be correlated. Charcoal is very resistant to
pressure (up to 22.5 MPa). Our results show that signiﬁcant fragmentation differences exist between
taxa. The total number of fragments after compression is largely dependent on the species, regardless of
the charring temperature. However, this interspeciﬁc variability is more signiﬁcant for small fragments
[1e2 mm], than for larger fragments [2e4 mm] and >4 mm, with the exception of Quercus, which
displays differential reactions to compression. Finally, a multifactorial analysis brings to light the impact
of the physical and anatomical characteristics of the different species on charcoal fragmentation.

1. Introduction
Charcoal preservation in archaeological sites is variable, even at
sites where combustion structures have been identiﬁed (ThéryParisot, 2001, 2010c). According to the current state of knowledge, there is no apparent relationship between charcoal preservation and the sedimentary context. Although this observation
does not follow a chronological pattern, it is particularly true for
Palaeolithic sites (Braadbaart et al., 2009, 2012; Beresford-Jones
et al., 2010; Théry-Parisot et al., 2010a), where identiﬁable,
macroscopic-sized charcoal is at times very rare and/or very
altered. In such contexts, charcoal is primarily preserved among the

mesoscopic and microscopic unidentiﬁable fraction (Marquer et al.,
2010, 2012), raising the question of the impact of post-depositional
processes on charcoal preservation. What are the effects of these
processes on anthracological assemblages? Do they have a linear
effect on charcoal or are some taxa more fragile than others due to
their anatomical structure or chemical composition? This naturally
brings us to the question of the representativeness of anthracological assemblages for assessing past vegetation and fuel
management.
Since the end of the 1990s, some researchers have focused on a
methodical approach to the formation process of anthracological
assemblages (Théry-Parisot 1998, 2001; 2013; Théry-Parisot et al.
2010a,b), including (i) human practices, (ii) the physical and
chemical modiﬁcations of wood during combustion, (iii) depositional and post-depositional processes. Human practices are
dependent on non-predictable cultural factors speciﬁc to each

group. On the other hand, combustion and post-depositional processes involve physico-chemical and mechanical transformations,
which are independent of socio-cultural contexts, and which affect
anthracological assemblages in terms of mass reduction and fragmentation. However, most palaeoenvironmental interpretations
are partly based on variations in the relative frequency of taxa,
calculated by counting the identiﬁed fragments in the studied
sample. The effects of combustion on charcoal fragmentation have
been the subject of numerous studies (cf. infra). Conversely, the
effects of post-depositional processes on anthracological assemblages are not so well documented. However, all processes, from
trampling to combustion residue, displacement by humans,
weathering, water run off transport, bio or cryoturbation phenomena, alternating freeze-thaw cycles or sediment soakingdesiccation, can induce charcoal fragmentation (for a better overview of sites formation processes see for example Goldberg and
Macphail, 2013). In this paper, we address the effects of depositional and post-depositional processes and the resulting potential
modiﬁcation of the assemblages.
The aim of this article is to characterize the physical properties
of several common temperate and Mediterranean European species
in the laboratory, using appropriate measurements on present-day
material. By assessing the differential reaction of each species to
mechanical post-depositional alteration processes, we can evaluate
the palaeoecological representativeness of the anthracological assemblages. This study involves 302 samples issued from 10 taxa,
charred at 3 different temperatures and subjected to standardized
compression tests. The results should allow us to assess (i) the
question of the mechanical properties of charcoal, (ii) the fragmentation level/rate of charcoal from different taxa and (iii) the
modalities of this fragmentation. The main objective of this study is
to produce data exposing the intrinsic mechanics of the tested
species, to evaluate their conservation potential and to appraise the
possibility of the under or over-representation of certain species in
archaeological contexts.

Blackford, 2000; Nichols et al., 2000; Scott et al., 2000; Scott,
2010; Carcaillet, 2001). Recent work on the impact of pH and
diagenesis on the anthracological material has brought to light a
structural alteration of charcoal in alkaline environments (Schiegl
et al., 1996; Cohen-Ofri et al., 2006; Rebollo et al., 2008; Braadbaart et al., 2009; Ascough et al., 2010, 2011a,b), but also the strong
inﬂuence of physical processes on the deterioration of the material
(Braadbaart et al., 2009). Among these physical processes, mechanical actions, which directly inﬂuence the fragmentation of
charcoal, play a preponderant role. Freeze/thaw laboratory experiments, coupled with measuring resistance to compression, have
shown that wood alteration ante combustion has a strong incidence on the mechanical resistance of charcoal (Théry-Parisot,
1998, 2001). More recently, a study of the mechanical properties
of species from the north of India showed that resistance to
compression and the dimensions of the ensuing fragments is
correlated to charring temperatures (Lancelotti et al., 2010). Mechanical resistance to compression is higher when compression is
applied lengthwise to the cross-section and dense wood is more
brittle than less compact woods. In temperate regions, abundant
data are available concerning the properties of wood used for
construction (Ashby, 2005; Forest Products Laboratory, 2010), but
nothing indicates that these data can be transposed to charcoal. For
this reason we developed an experimental study of the mechanical
behaviour of present-day charcoal to evaluate the fragmentation
process of the main species identiﬁed in temperate European
anthracological assemblages.
3. Materials and methods
The mechanical tests were carried out in the École des Mines de
Paris (ParisTech CEMEF- Sophia-Antipolis, France). The aim of these
tests was to measure the mechanical response of charcoal to
compression and the fragmentation modalities (number and size of
fragments). The experimental procedure is based on previous work
by Théry-Parisot (1998, 2001)

2. Research history in charcoal fragmentation
3.1. Sample preparation
After some pioneering studies (Salisbury and Jane, 1940; Santa,
1961; Vernet, 1973; Thiébault, 1980), methodological reﬂections on
the representativeness of anthracological assemblages began in the
1980s (Chabal, 1988, 1997, 1990; Badal-Garcia, 1990, 1992). The ﬁrst
approach consisted in analyzing the global fragmentation rate and
the size of the fragments of the different taxa in archaeological
samples. The analysis of Protohistoric archaeological levels (Le
Marduel, Lattes, south of France) yielded fragmentation histograms
with a Poisson distribution for all the taxa within the same layer.
These studies led to the formulation of the “single fragmentation
law” hypothesis for all species (Chabal, 1991, 1997). “A posteriori”
analysis included the undifferentiated fragmentation stages: combustion, post-depositional processes, sampling and sieving of the
material. At the same time, several studies concentrated on the
effects of combustion on anatomy and fragmentation (Rossen and
Olson, 1985; Smart and Hoffman, 1988; Scott and Jones 1991;
Prior and Gasson, 1993; Loreau, 1994; Vaughan and Nichols 1995;
Belcher et al. 2005; Lingens et al. 2005; Braadbaart and Poole,
2008; Théry-Parisot and Chabel, 2010). These works demonstrated “the non-linearity of species behaviour towards ﬁre suggesting that combustion is a taphonomic agent, which randomly
affects deposits and whose effect on the assemblage is almost
impossible to control” (Théry-Parisot et al., 2010a,b). The impact of
post-depositional processes on anthracological assemblages is a
less-developed aspect of research. Bio-turbation and transport
were mainly studied in the domain of pedo-anthracology (Thinon,
1992; Vaughan and Nichols, 1995; Carcaillet and Talon, 1996;

Sample preparation must take account of both the (i) constraints
of the shape of the samples used for the mechanical tests and (ii)
the effect of the physico-chemical alteration on the mechanical
properties of the material during combustion. It generally involves
some form of standardization far removed from the reality of the
studied archaeological contexts. The samples have to present two
perfectly cut parallel sides with no structural, ﬁssure type
alteration.
The production of 2 cm cubes, with no charring ﬁssures, is one of
the restrictions of our protocol.
The tests concerned charred samples from 10 taxa commonly
found in archaeological contexts in southern Europe: Acer pseudoplatanus, Betula pubescens, Carpinus betulus, Corylus avellana,
Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Populus tremula, Pinus pinaster,
Pinus sylvestris and Quercus pubescens. The dry wood (12% moisture
content) is issued from branches with a 10e15 cm section.
3.2. Charring protocol
In order to limit sample deformation during charring, each cube
was wrapped in aluminium foil, placed in a porcelain crucible,
covered with sand, and then charred in a mufﬂe furnace. The
charring temperature has a direct incidence on the mechanical
resistance of charcoal (Hillis, 1984; Fengel and Wegener, 1989;
Yildiz et al., 2006; Borrega and Kärenlampi, 2008; Gündüz et al.,
2008; Mburu et al., 2008; Korkut et al., 2008; Korkut and

J. Chrzazvez et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 44 (2014) 30e42

3.3. Physical characterization
The physical properties of each sample were recorded in order
to evaluate their incidence on the fragmentation process. The mass
(M for dry wood and MC for charcoal), and the dimensions of the
cube were measured in 3 directions, ﬁrst on air-dried wood and
then on charcoal. This allowed for the calculation of the volume (V
for dry wood and VC for charcoal), the density using the formula
D ¼ M/V (WD for dry wood, WCD for charcoal), mass loss (M  MC)/
M (Mloss %), volume loss (V  VC)/V (Vloss %) and density loss
(WD  WCD)/WD (Dloss %).
Systematic porosity measurements were taken on the transverse sections of charcoal samples using SEM image analysis. The
porosity ratio corresponds to the difference in porosity between the
initial and ﬁnal wood. These measurements were incorporated into
the multivariate analysis to include the impact of the porosity of
taxa on their mechanical properties and fragmentation. A macro for
this measurement was written with image J software (Ducom,
2010).
3.4. Compression procedure
A hydraulic traction-compression testing machine, equipped
with a 10 kN sensor (Instron 1121), was used for the compression
experiments. Pressure was applied parallel to the ﬁbers. The
descent speed was ﬁxed at 0.1 mm/s during 30 s from the time of
contact with the sample, which was placed on its transversal side.
The pressure applied and the resulting decrease in the height of
the sample (displacement of the tray), were recorded during the
tests. These values allowed us to plot the stress (MPa)/strain (%)
curves, by dividing the force by the surface of the transversal side of
the sample (stress), on one hand, and the displacement by the
height of the sample (strain), on the other hand.
Fig. 1 represents a typical test curve. It is comprised of three
main parts:
- a gradual rise after the initial contact, which corresponds to
setting up the compression;
- a rapid and linear rise of the stress until the peak, which corresponds to the crushing of the whole sample;
- a more or less brutal decrease in stress, possibly with nonnegligible drag strain, corresponding to the destruction of the
charcoal structure.
It is noteworthy that compression is never reversible; it is not
therefore an elastic phenomenon.
This diagram allows us to calculate several mechanical indicators in phase 2:
- Maximum stress called crushing strength (CS in MPa);
- Crushing modulus (CM in MPa);

Setting

Hiziroglu, 2009; Kocaefe et al., 2010; Majano-Majano et al., 2012;
Poletto et al., 2012). Consequently, the choice of temperature must
take into consideration the different stages of the thermal deterioration of the wood (Byrne and Nagle, 1997; Rousset et al., 2006;
Braadbaart and Poole, 2008), but must also reﬂect the probable
temperatures of archaeological hearths (Costamagno et al., 2010;
Théry-Parisot and Chabal, 2010). The samples were charred at
three different temperatures: 400, 500 and 750  C, in porcelain
crucibles placed in the hot oven during 30 min. 302 of the 400
prepared samples were usable, representing a 25% loss principally
for samples charred at 400 and 750  C. On average, 30 samples
were tested for each species, with an average of 9.1, 15.6 and 5.5
samples at temperatures of 400  C, 500  C and 750  C respectively.

- Theoretical crushing strain (TS ¼ CS/CM).
Crushing strength (CS) is directly linked to the maximum force
(pressure) that can be applied to a piece of charcoal before complete destruction. If the CS is low, the charcoal is less resistant to
pressure.
Theoretical crushing strain (TS) is mainly related to the time
required to completely crush the charcoal. If TS is low, the charcoal
is more fragile in the compressive test.
Crushing modulus (CM), like any modulus, relates charcoal
contraction to the compressive force exerted on it. If CM is low, the
charcoal is less rigid during compression.
As both wood and charcoal are honeycomb-like materials, mechanical properties in grain direction are roughly proportional to
their density (Gibson and Ashby, 1999). It is therefore interesting to
use “speciﬁc” crushing strength, i.e. CS divided by charcoal density:
CS/WCD (expressed in 103 m2/s2), as a criterion, independently of
density itself.
The applied pressure induces sample fragmentation. The residues of each test were systematically sieved in three different
meshes: [1e2 mm], [2e4 mm], > 4 mm and the fragments were
then counted using image analysis (ImageJ).
3.5. Statistical methods
Several univariate to multivariate statistical methods were used
to analyze the data and to assess the relation between the mechanical properties and the fragmentation process. The choice of
tests depends on the purpose of the analysis and the nature of the
available data. Non-parametric tests based on the ranks of the values
were chosen when the normality of the distribution was not veriﬁed. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient is a nonparametric
measure of statistical dependence between two variables. Regression analysis was used when the dependent variable follows a
Normal distribution. The very ﬂexible and extremely powerful oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA), widely used for the analysis of
experimental schemes, can simultaneously analyse several scenarios and detect the effects of independent nominal variables on a
large number of continuous variables. This test was performed to
assess and evaluate the effect of the charring temperature and the
taxon on the fragmentation process. The BonferronieDunn test allows for comparisons, controlling the family error rate. It was carried
out in order to identify groups of taxon with the same fragmentation
process. A multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was applied to
our data set categories to test relationships between variables.

4. Results (Table 1)
4.1. Physical and mechanical properties
4.1.1. Mass, volume and density
In our tests, charring induces severe mass, volume and density
loss.
If we disregard wood water loss at the beginning of charring (on
average 12%), on average, mass loss (Mloss) approaches 55% at
400  C, 60% at 500  C and 70% at 750  C. There are no systematic
signiﬁcant differences between the different species.
Volume loss (Vloss) is about 50% at 400 and 500  C and increases to 58% at 750  C, which is considerable in comparison to the
hygroscopic shrinkage between air-dried wood and oven-dried
wood (about 6e8%). In this case, there are noticeable systematic
differences between species, with Quercus pubescens displaying the
lowest volume shrinkage and Carpinus betulus the highest.
Density loss (Dloss) increases markedly with temperature
(Fig. 2a). It rises from 32% at 400  C, to 40% at 500  C, and reaches
55% at 750  C. Average density loss is 40%, with variations from 33
to 50% according to the species (Fig. 2b), with Quercus and Carpinus
representing the two extremes (Quercus records a much higher
density loss than the other species e which tends to slot it into the
average e whereas that of Carpinus is much lower).

33

Charring tends to regulate density differences between species
but charcoal density remains globally proportional to the initial
wood density (Fig. 2c). The Spearman correlation test indicates a
signiﬁcant positive correlation between the two series of values
(rho ¼ 0.69/p-value < 2.2ee16) (Table 2).

4.1.2. Crushing strength (CS), crushing modulus (CM) and
theoretical crushing strain (TS) (Fig. 3)
-

The effect of temperature

The three mechanical indicators evolve markedly with temperature (Table 1). All three decrease when the charring temperature increases, with crushing strength (CS) being more affected
than the others. The crushing modulus (CM) decreases slightly
between 400  C (424 MPa) and 500  C (396 MPa), but is almost
halved at 750  C (220 MPa) (Fig. 3a). Crushing strength (CS) varies
on average from 16.9 MPa at 400  C, to 14.5 MPa at 500  C and
6.9 MPa at 750  C (Fig. 3b). As for the theoretical crushing strain
(TS), it decreases regularly from 4.3% at 400  C to 3.2% at 750  C,
with a value of 3.8% at 500  C (Fig. 3c).
It appears from these results that charcoal becomes less resistant and more fragile as charring temperatures increase.

Fig. 2. Mean density loss by charring temperatures (a), by species (b), Mean density of wood and charcoal by species (c).

-

Species effect

Due to the fact that a larger and more constant number of
specimens were charred at 500  C, the mean values at this temperature were used to compare species.
The three indicators vary according to the different species
(Table 1), which partly explains the substantial standard deviations
observed for this temperature. The differences between taxa are
noticeable, with CM ranging between 285 MPa for Quercus and
591 MPa for Carpinus, CS between 7.8 MPa for Quercus and 20.3 MPa
for Corylus and TS between 2.8% for Quercus and 4.7% for Corylus.
Quercus is by far the least resistant and most fragile taxon, while
Acer, Carpinus and Corylus are the most resistant and the least fragile.
The difference is even more accentuated between Quercus and
Corylus for the speciﬁc crushing strength: respectively 17.1 and 51.3.
-

Interaction between the effects of temperature and species

An increase in temperature globally induces a decrease in
charcoal resistance (CS), regardless of species (Fig. 3). This decrease
is partly due to the reduction in charcoal density, which is most
pronounced between 500 and 750  C.
According to the CIRAD database (Cirad database TROPIXÒ 7,
2011), measurements taken on 243 air-dried wood samples from

tree species, with densities ranging from 0.2 to 1.2, show that
resistance to axial compression is proportional to the density of dry
wood (WD): CS ¼ 84.7 * WD, with a coefﬁcient of regression
R2 ¼ 0.88. The CS/WD ratio is called speciﬁc resistance (in relation
to density) and varies little between species.
It is therefore interesting to compare the speciﬁc resistance of
charcoal (CS/WCD) to the mean value observed for air-dried wood.
On average (Table 1), the ratio between (CS/WCD) and this mean
value (84.7) is still 0.48 and 0.44 for 400  C and 500  C respectively,
but it drops to 0.28 at 750  C.
There are marked differences in temperature between species
when the sudden drop in resistance occurs (Fig. 4). Fraxinus, Fagus
and Quercus already display low values at 400  C and these values
do not fall suddenly at 750  C. Pinus pinaster decreases clearly between 400 and 500  C but not so much between 500 and 750  C. All
the other species present a strong decrease in resistance between
500 and 750  C.
4.2. Fragmentation
4.2.1. Global fragmentation process, all class sizes combined
After the compression tests, the samples produced on average,
170 fragments at 400  C, 200 fragments at 500  C and 165 fragments at 750  C (Fig. 5a). The relationship between temperature

and the number of fragments is therefore not consistent during our
tests. The total number of fragments for each species presents
marked variability, ranging from 34 fragments for Populus to 400
for Fraxinus, with, on average, 101 fragments for Populus and 246 for
Quercus pubescens.
The differences between species are signiﬁcant, as shown by the
results of the ANOVA (Table 3), which make it possible to classify
the effects of temperature and species. Both factors combined

account for 61.5% of the total variability but the F- value and the
sum of the squares for the SPECIES factor are more signiﬁcant,
explaining 49.7% (R2) of the variation of the model. The histogram
(Fig. 6) summarizing the total number of fragments produced by
compression, according to species and temperature, clearly shows
the preponderant role of the taxon on fragmentation. Apart from
some rare exceptions (500  C/Fraxinus), the observed variability is
much more signiﬁcant between the different species than between
temperatures.
A bilateral paired-comparison test brings to light four partly
overlapping groups of taxa. Populus on one hand, and Quercus and
Fraxinus on the other hand, display contrasting responses, which
differ from those of most species. On average, Populus is not very
fragmented whereas Quercus and Fraxinus are much more fragmented. The other species are clustered around two median
groups. Fagus is similar to Populus, followed by a group made up of
P. pinaster, Acer and Betula. P. sylvestris, Corylus and Carpinus tend to
display slightly greater fragmentation and P. sylvestris has median
fragmentation (Table 4).

strength are not correlated with the total number of fragments produced. The crushing modulus is very slightly correlated with the total
number of fragments: the p-value is signiﬁcant (0.0076), but the
determination coefﬁcient is low (rho ¼ 0.15). Scatter graph (Fig. 7)
explicitly shows that there is no relation between crushing strength
(which is a good expression of the brittleness of charcoal) and the
number of fragments produced by compression tests. In other words,
mechanical properties and fragmentation are strongly dependent on
the species, but there is no correlation between the two factors
themselves. Each species is more or less resistant to compression but
once the fragmentation process has begun, it affects each species
independently of the pressure applied.
4.2.3. Fragmentation modalities by class size [1e2 mm], [2e4 mm],
>4 mm
The ﬁrst observation concerns the disparity in fragment distribution between the different class sizes. All species combined, the
average number of fragments by class size is 111 in the smallest
class size [1e2 mm], 51 in the second [2e4 mm], and only 19
fragments larger than 4 mm (Fig. 5b).
According to the species, the number of fragments varies from
16 to 304 in the class [1e2 mm], from 11 to 121 in the class [2e
4 mm] and from 5 to 62 in the class >4 mm (Fig. 5c). The variance of
the three series is thus quite marked and the coefﬁcient of variation
is around 40% for the three class sizes.

Fragmentation variability by species is very signiﬁcant in the
class [1e2 mm] with substantial tiering of the dispersion boxes
(Fig. 8a). Populus is the least fragmented species with a minimum of
16 fragments and Fraxinus is the most fragmented species with a
maximum of 304 fragments. The bilateral paired-comparison test
(BonferronieDunn procedure, Table 4) distinguishes four signiﬁcantly different groups.
The upper and lower extremes are respectively made up of
an isolated species, Populus, and a group made up of Corylus,
Quercus, Carpinus, Fraxinus, which generally yields more fragments. Fagus and P. pinaster are similar to Populus, whereas Acer,
P. sylvestris and Betula display intermediate fragmentation, between the species with high and low fragmentation. Variability
is less marked in the intermediate class [2e4 mm], where
divergence between the species is slightly reduced and only two
species deviate: Populus generally produces less fragments
(mean ¼ 33) and Quercus (mean ¼ 78) produces on average a lot
more fragments. As for the other species, Betula, Fagus, Carpinus
and Corylus present a low fragmentation tendency whereas
Fraxinus, P. Sylvestris, P. pinaster and Acer display a high tendency
(Fig. 8b).
Lastly, in the >4 mm class, the dispersion boxes have a more or
less constant distribution, apart from Quercus, which is quite detached from the other species (BonferronieDunn-test). Variability
is generally much less signiﬁcant here (Fig. 8c).

J. Chrzazvez et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 44 (2014) 30e42

In the upper left part, the high crushing strength is strongly
correlated to the presence of spiral thickenings and, secondarily, to
the “small aggregate vessels” modality.
Lastly, in the lower part of the graphic, the “low density” (WCD)
and “small isolated vessels or homoxylous wood” are linked to the
low total number of fragments.
Wood with a marked porous zone, with large vessels, such as
Quercus and Fraxinus, and with long radial ﬁle vessels (Carpinus and
Corylus) are the most fragmented. Homogeneous wood (small
isolated diffuse vessels or homoxylous) such as Populus, Acer, Betula
or P. pinaster, P. sylvestris are those that produce fewer fragments.
Corylus, Carpinus and Acer present a higher crushing strength than
the other taxa. This characteristic seems to be linked to the presence of spiral thickenings. Conversely, the weak value of crushing
strength is either linked to the porosity of the charcoal (case of
Fraxinus and Quercus), or to its low density, as is the case for Populus, P. sylvestris and P. pinaster. In all cases, wood with a low density
presents a low value for crushing strength. On the other hand,
dense wood alternatively yields either very high or very low values.

4.4. Results synthesis

P.

Table 3 summarizes correlation coefﬁcients and brings to light
the differential responses of the tested species as regards resistance
to compression and fragmentation. These two processes are clearly
not related. We have observed that:

Fig. 6.

Differences between taxa are thus very slight in the >4 mm size
and relatively minor in the [2e4 mm] class. They are most marked
in the [1e2 mm] class.

-

4.3. Multivariate analysis
The multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) conducted on all
the specimens charred at 500  C allows us to discuss the relationships between our results and the main physical and anatomical
characteristics of the studied species. Only the variables with a
strong impact on the analysis have been retained (deﬁned by two or
three modalities: high/medium/low). For example, ﬁber thickness
was initially tested and then removed. Moreover, the species
themselves are integrated as supplementary variables and are not
used for the calculation of the ACM (Fig. 9).
On axis 1, accounting for 62. 21% of the total variance, the “large
vessels”, “very large and long rays” and “high porosity” modalities
are closely linked. These modalities are secondarily associated with
the absence of spiral thickenings and are related to a low crushing
strength (CS) and a high number of fragments >4 mm. On axis 2, in
the upper right part of the graphic, in relation to the active variables
on axis 1, “high density” is strongly correlated with the high values
of the total number of fragments and the high number of fragments
>1 mm.

Temperature increase generally induces a decrease in the
resistance of the charcoal, whatever the species (Fig. 3). This is
similar to the results of tests carried out at low temperatures on
industrial wood (Gündüz et al., 2008; Korkut et al., 2008; Korkut
and Hiziroglu, 2009; Kocaefe et al., 2010; Majano-Majano et al.,
2012). Crushing strength loss is particularly noticeable above
500  C.
Density loss is correlated to the charring temperature but is also
related to the species. However, charring tends to attenuate the
differences in density between species (Fig. 2).
Density loss induces crushing strength loss and accounts for the
main mechanical properties of charcoal.
All temperatures combined, charcoal resistance is also linked to
the species. The mechanical properties of the species are
modiﬁed at distinctive thermal thresholds (Fig. 3).
Resistance to pressure is dependent on the species but fragmentation intensity is not correlated to the resistance of the
material itself. The least resistant species are not those subject to
the most fragmentation (Fig. 7).
The relationship between the number of fragments produced by
compression and temperature is not constant (Fig. 5a).
The total number of fragments after compression depends
mainly on the species, regardless of temperature (Table 3 and

Fig. 6). Populus is not prone to much fragmentation whereas
Quercus and Fraxinus produce a lot of fragments. Between these
two extremes, Fagus, P. pinaster, Acer and Betula display little
fragmentation, whereas Corylus and Carpinus tend to be highly
fragmented. P. sylvestris shows an intermediate response to
fragmentation (Table 4 and Fig. 5c).
However, interspeciﬁc variability is signiﬁcant for the small
fragments [1e2 mm], but less so for larger fragments [2e4 mm].
In the largest class size (>4 mm), only Quercus is different from
the other taxa, producing a lot more fragments (Fig. 8).
Wood with a marked porous zone, with large vessels, and with
long radial ﬁle vessels (Carpinus and Corylus) produces the most
fragments. Homogeneous wood (small isolated diffuse vessels
or homoxylates) such as Populus, Acer, Betula or P. pinaster,
P. sylvestris are those that produce the least fragments (Fig. 9).
The presence of spiral thickenings (Corylus, Carpinus and Acer) is
linked to a higher crushing strength. The low value of crushing
strength is either linked to the porosity of the charcoal (Fraxinus
and Quercus), or to its low density (Populus, P. sylvestris and
P. pinaster). In all cases, wood with a low density presents a low
value for crushing strength. On the other hand, dense wood
alternatively yields either very high or very low values (Fig. 9).

5. Interpretation
5.1. Focus on factors impacting fragmentation
-

Density

The density of dry wood seems to have an impact on fragmentation: charcoal from dense wood is very fragmented while low to
medium density wood charcoal presents low to medium fragmentation. Despite a low coefﬁcient of determination (0.267), there

is a signiﬁcant positive correlation (Rhô ¼ 0.517) between “wood
density” (and therefore charcoal density) and the "total number of
fragments”. As the majority of the fragments are in the [1e2 mm]
fraction, density is also logically correlated with the number of
small fragments, as shown by the MCA analysis: the denser the
wood, the higher the number of small fragments.
-

Wood porosity vs. homogeneity

Fragmentation intensity is related to charcoal porosity. Cellular
organization seems to be strongly linked to the fragmentation
processes. Marked porous zones with large vessels or radial pore
ﬁles are prone to fragmentation. Conversely, more homogeneous
porous wood (with small isolated diffuse vessels or homoxylates)
such as Populus, Acer, Betula or P. pinaster, P. sylvestris tends to be
less fragmented.
-

Length and width of the rays

The production of large fragments, as for Quercus, is also
linked to the presence of a signiﬁcant porous zone. But Quercus
differs from the other species by the presence of multiseriate
rays, which create fragile zones after combustion and account for
the speciﬁc fragmentation mode of this species. For the other
species, the rays, whether multiseriate or uniseriate, play a secondary role in both fragmentation and the mechanical properties
(cf. central position and weak contribution in the construction of
the MCA graphic).
5.2. Factors affecting crushing strength
In all cases, charcoal with a low density presents a low value for
crushing strength, but high density charcoal alternatively yields

This study shows that the anatomical structure of the different
tested wood taxa has a signiﬁcant impact on the mechanical
properties of charcoal. Charring produces less heterogeneous material than the different initial woods, but it does not erase the
differences in density, organization and cellular composition, etc.
Thermal response, resistance to pressure, fragmentation and its
modalities are largely dependent on the anatomical features and
thus, on the physical characteristics of wood. Some of the noted
differences are signiﬁcant from an archaeological viewpoint. The
alteration of the mechanical properties follows a differential thermal pattern depending on the species, which can cause differences
in taxa fragmentation in the same hearth or among scattered
charcoals. The formation temperature of charcoal also inﬂuences
the fragmentation of the material (Théry-Parisot, 2013). Yet, the
temperatures are highly ﬂuctuant in a same combustion structure.
It is therefore very difﬁcult to archaeologically assess the question
of the weakness of charcoal in relation to charring temperatures.
Fragmentation differences are mainly visible outside the
[>4 mm] class size. These ﬁrst results tend to show that anthracoanalysis limited to charcoal over 4 mm would induce less risk of
under or over-representation of the different taxa, with the
exception of Quercus, which is over-represented in this class size.
We also noted variations in crushing strength values from one
species to another. This signiﬁes that the rupture of the material is
not initiated at the same pressure levels. Thus, from an archaeological perspective, in the same burial conditions, taxa will not
necessarily demonstrate the same resistance capacity, which could

very high or very low values. The relationship between charcoal
density and crushing strength is thus not clear.
Corylus, Carpinus and Acer present a higher crushing strength
than the other taxa. This characteristic is linked to the presence of
spiral thickenings, which are preserved after charring. Conversely,
the weak value of crushing strength is either linked to the porosity
of the charcoal, in the case of Fraxinus and Quercus, or to its low
density, as is the case for Populus, P. sylvestris and P. pinaster.
For dry wood, crushing strength is more or less proportional to
wood density. Although Quercus is the wood with the highest
density, its charcoal has the lowest crushing strength. This is due to
the fact that charring induces the highest density loss for this
species, perhaps because of its chemical composition. In addition,
Quercus displays two orthogonal arrays of weak zones: an initial
porous zone in a tangential direction and very large rays in the
radial direction. This should be conducive to the initiation of a large
number of cracks at rather low stress levels.
On the other hand, Corylus, Carpinus and Acer present a higher
crushing strength than the other taxa, although the density of these
species is no higher than that of Fraxinus, for example. They are
more homogeneous woods with less distinct weak zones prone to
fractures. Furthermore, the presence of spiral thickenings in the
ﬁbers, which are preserved after charring, appears to reinforce the
structure of these charred woods.
Populus is characterized by a very homogeneous structure, but
with a much lower density than the former species.
The low resistance of Fraxinus and Fagus charcoal, in spite of the
rather high density of these woods, can also be explained by the
presence of weak zones: tangential (initial porous zone) for Fraxinus and radial (large rays) for Fagus.

bias interpretation. However, crushing strength depends on the
formation temperature of charcoal and has no impact on the
quantity of fragments produced after the rupture of the material.
This results in a set of extremely variable situations where it is
impossible to assess or to measure all the parameters. It is thus
important to study and to take account of burial conditions (the
nature and intensity of post-depositional processes involved in the
deposit formation, rate of burial at the scale of the site, but also
intra-site variations), but it is nonetheless impossible to infer the
mechanical behaviour of charcoal. However, when interpreting the
data, it is imperative to bear in mind that some taxa are more fragile
than others.
Conversely, the values obtained for crushing strength appear to be
more signiﬁcant. Charcoal tolerates relatively high pressure before
fragmentation, oscillating between 8 and 19.4 MPa, with an average of
13.7 MPa. Mechanically, charcoal is considered to be fragile. In comparison, the crushing strength of common conifers (uncharred) is
between 18 and 30 MPa, that of ordinary concrete is between 16 and
40 MPa and that of steel between 235 and 350 MPa (Ashby, 2005). Yet
most post-depositional processes do not generate very strong pressure. Cattle exert greater static pressure (160e192 kPa) on soil than
sheep (83 kPa), although this pressure is at least doubled when animals are walking (Drewry, 2006), which represents less than 0.4 MPa.
The value for human beings cannot be much higher. The maximum
pressure measured during freeze propagation experiments in a
limestone notch is about 6 MPa (Bost, 2008).
Thus, the intense fragmentation of charcoal (extending at
times to the disappearance of the macroscopic fraction), characteristic of some Pleistocene sites (Théry-Parisot, 2001; ThéryParisot et al., 2010a; Beresford-Jones et al., 2010, Marquer
et al., 2012) does not seem to result from single, short-term
processes. However, classic processes, such as freeze-thaw

action or trampling occurring repeatedly during the course of a
phase of low (or no) sedimentation, could doubtlessly generate
progressive charcoal weakening, leading to extreme fragmentation. Under natural conditions, the repetition of these processes
induces progressive mechanical fatigue of the material (which is
not measured in our experiment), thereby increasing charcoal
damage. Finally, it is important to distinguish post-depositional
processes from fuel management. The disappearance of the
coarse fraction due to burial conditions sometimes leads to the
misinterpretation of charcoal scarcity, suggesting that other
fuels, such as bones or dung, were used. Further investigations
based on the study of very thin coarse fractions combined with
geoarchaeological studies, are required, so that more reliable
interpretations can be proposed. (Fernández-Jalvo et al., 2010;
Marquer et al., 2010, 2012; Miller et al., 2010; Scott and
Damblon, 2010).
Naturally, these observations must be moderated, notably
because of the way the samples are made, which is quite far
removed from the archaeological reality. Complementary analyses
are required, incorporating other criteria, such as the chemical
composition of the taxa. Moreover, this paper does not take account
of the other stages of fragmentation, namely combustion. Through
cross indexing data from research on combustion and postdepositional processes, it will become possible to gain a better
understanding of anthracological assemblages.
Based on an innovative experimental approach combining both
archaeobotany and biomechanics, these results are fundamental for
a comprehensive understanding of archaeology, archaeobotany and
palaeoecology. They document the mechanical behaviour of charcoal, a largely unknown domain up until now. They enhance our
understanding of charcoal taphonomy by providing added resolution and improving the accuracy of charcoal analysis.
