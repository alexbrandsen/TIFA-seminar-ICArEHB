Online enhancements: supplemental ﬁgures

Analyses of archaeological material recovered from several Middle Paleolithic sites in southwest France have provided strong corroborating data on Neanderthal use of ﬁre. Both direct and indirect data show that Neanderthals in
this region were frequently and/or intensively using ﬁre during warmer periods, but such evidence declines signiﬁcantly in occupations that took place during colder periods. One possible explanation for this pattern is that it
reﬂects the inability of Western European Neanderthals to make ﬁre, simply because natural sources of ﬁre occur
much more frequently during warmer climatic periods. Regardless of the explanation, the long periods of diminished
evidence of ﬁre shows that, unlike modern humans, these hominins were not obligate ﬁre users, and this fact in itself
raises important questions of how they adapted, physiologically and/or technologically, to the generally harsh glacial
conditions of the middle latitude of Europe and to reduced energy returns typical of raw food. As a corollary, it also
raises questions regarding their need for and use of ﬁre during the warmer periods.

Throughout history, pyrotechnology, a uniquely human technological innovation, has been seen as a major factor in allowing humans to adapt to a wide range of environmental circumstances. But as noted recently by Shimelmitz et al. (2014:196),
“only when ﬁre use became a regular part of human behavioral
adaptations could its beneﬁts be fully realized and its evolutionary consequences fully expressed.” Recently a series of
papers was published (Aldeias et al. 2012; Goldberg et al. 2012;
Sandgathe et al. 2011a, 2011b) looking at the evidence for
combustion features at two sites in southwest France, Roc de
Marsal and Pech de l’Azé IV. At both sites two patterns were
apparent. First, there were long periods of time when, in spite
of extensive evidence for ongoing occupation, evidence for the
use or presence of ﬁre was lacking. Second, as indicated by the

dates and faunal remains, these periods of little or no use of
ﬁre reﬂected a time of increasingly cold conditions. Given an
abundance of evidence for ﬁre use earlier in the sequences of
both sites during the warmer periods of MIS 5, the lack of
evidence during the colder periods was especially surprising.
Earlier, we suggested (Sandgathe et al. 2011a) that these European hominins lacked the ability to start ﬁres, relying instead on natural ﬁres. This suggestion was based on the fact that
most wildﬁres are caused by lightning strikes and that lightning occurs much more frequently during warmer and wetter
periods and more rarely during cold, dry periods. Regardless of
the reason for the long hiatus, however, if ﬁre were not being
used during long periods of occupation at these sites, this raises
important questions regarding the role of ﬁre in the overall

adaptation of these hominins to the colder conditions of MIS 4
and MIS 3. Some of these questions will be addressed later in
this paper. First, however, it is important to review the evidence
from these two sites and others that have been studied subsequently, taking into account some results of recent laboratory
experiments on the transfer of heat from surface ﬁres to underlying sediments (Aldeias 2017; Aldeias et al. 2016).

Evidence for Presence and Absence of Fire
at Pech de l’Azé IV and Roc de Marsal
Pech de l’Azé IV (Pech IV) and Roc de Marsal are two Mousterian cave sites in the Dordogne region of southwest France
(ﬁg. A1; ﬁgs. A1–A7 available online) recently excavated by the
same multidisciplinary team from 2000 to 2010 (Dibble et al.
2009; McPherron, Soressi, and Dibble 2001; Sandgathe et al.
2008; Turq et al. 2009, 2011). Both sites span the period of time
from mid to late MIS 5 into MIS 3. At both sites there is clear
evidence for ﬁre use in the basal layers and very limited evidence
of it in the upper layers.
Pech IV contains several major geological strata of Pleistoceneage sediments (ﬁg. A2). The lowermost, Layer 8, lies directly on
bedrock (see Dibble et al. 2009) and is dated by thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) to
approximately 95 5 5 kya, or MIS 5c (Gibbard and van
Kolfschoten 2005; Jacobs et al. 2016; Richter et al. 2012;
Winograd et al. 1997). In keeping with these dates, the associated fauna also suggests a warm, humid climatic regime
(Dibble et al. 2009; Laquay 1981; Niven 2013). Evidence for
ﬁre, including clear organic- and ash-rich units, burned bone,
burned lithics, and rubeﬁed (reddened) sediments is abundant in this layer.
In the overlying layers, there is little direct evidence of ﬁre.
Following the heavily disturbed Layer 7, Layer 6 is also associated with a faunal assemblage (ﬁg. A3) that reﬂects a relatively temperate wooded environment and dates to approximately 77 kya (Jacobs et al. 2016). Although in his earlier
excavation of the site, Bordes (1975) did observe some limited
traces of ﬁre residues in this layer, our own excavations did not.
Following another partially disturbed layer (5B), Layer 5A
represents the beginning of a colder period, with a signiﬁcant
increase in reindeer, and this trend to colder conditions continues through Layer 4, which dates to around the beginning of
MIS 4. The ﬁnal Pleistocene layer, Layer 3, is dated by a
number of methods (see also McPherron et al. 2012) to around
50 kya, or MIS 3. Virtually no direct evidence of ﬁre was seen in
Layers 4 and 5, although burned bones were observed in thin
section and some dispersed charcoal occurred in Layer 3.
Another Middle Paleolithic site excavated by the same
team is Roc de Marsal, which is located about 20 km west of
Pech IV (Turq et al. 2009). Here excavations recognized 13 stratigraphic layers (ﬁg. A4). At the base, Layers 13 through 10 represent locally mobilized sediments from weathering of the limestone bedrock. Layer 10 contains some limited archaeological
materials (n p 129 lithics), but these may be mostly or entirely

S279

intrusive. Artifact densities in Layers 9 through 2 are very high
(e.g., n p 8,100 lithics for Layer 9). Layer 1 is a disturbed
Holocene deposit.
Layers 9 through 5 comprise a single lithostratigraphic unit
with signiﬁcant interbedded darker anthropogenic components including major concentrations of ash, charcoal, and
burned objects. The faunal data (ﬁg. A5) indicate temperate
conditions with an abundance of forest species, suggesting a late
MIS 5a date (Marquet in Sandgathe et al. 2008). The overlying
layers, Layers 4 through 2, show increasingly colder and drier
conditions that would correspond to MIS 3 (see Castel et al.
2016; Guérin et al. 2012, 2016; Sandgathe et al. 2008).
As at Pech IV, direct evidence for ﬁre (see Aldeias 2017) is
found not throughout the Roc de Marsal sequence but rather
only in the earliest layers. This evidence includes discrete
charcoal and ash units, burned or calcined bone, burned
lithics, and rubeﬁed sediments (Aldeias et al. 2012; Goldberg
et al. 2012). In Layers 7 and 9 localized examples of “stacked”
hearths are clearly visible in section view (ﬁg. A6), which indicates that individual hearths were repeatedly constructed in
more or less the same location throughout the duration of each
of these stratigraphic components. However, not all of the lower
layers exhibit direct and intensive evidence for ﬁre and in fact,
such evidence alternates: Layers 5, 7, and 9 are rich in such
features, while Layers 6 and 8 have little or no direct evidence for
them. Abundant hearths in the lower levels of the site were also
mentioned in the unpublished notes of the previous excavator,
J. Laﬁlle.
To summarize (and as shown in ﬁg. A7), the Middle Paleolithic occupations of Pech de l’Azé IV and Roc de Marsal
overlap considerably in time, with initial occupations during
a temperate period followed by occupations that occurred
during a marked deterioration in climate. At both sites unmistakable hearth features occur in their lower layers and
indicate that ﬁre was certainly used at this time, that is, during
the time of relatively warmer conditions. But it is equally clear
from both sites that ﬁre use was not a constant element in the
occupations. At Roc de Marsal, for example, the lower layers
seem to alternate between those with clear ﬁre residues and
those without. At both sites, however, the upper Mousterian
layers (Layers 4 through 2 at Roc de Marsal and Layers 5 and 4
at Pech IV) contain no identiﬁable ﬁre features, including no
concentrations of charcoal or ash and limited quantities of
burned bone or ﬂint. At best, very rare and very small fragments (!0.5 cm) of charcoal were noted, and these were primarily conﬁned to Layer 3 of Pech IV (where there are also
slightly more heated ﬂints).
How Good Are These Data?
The primary question to be addressed ﬁrst is whether or not
the absence of direct evidence for ﬁre is indeed evidence of
ﬁre’s absence. With regard to taphonomic factors, strong arguments can be made to show that postdepositional processes
were not signiﬁcant factors in removing the direct evidence.

First of all, at both sites well-preserved ﬁre residues occur both
inside the caves as well as beyond what would have been the drip
lines at the time of occupation. Therefore the degree of overhead
cover is not a factor. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the
form of edge damage on the lithic artifacts, preferred orientations of objects, winnowing of smaller objects, or micromorphological studies of the sediments to indicate signiﬁcant postdepositional disturbances or erosion in the upper layers of either
site. Thus, no site formation processes have been identiﬁed that
could have removed the ﬁre residues.
Nonetheless, even if direct evidence for ﬁre may be have
been removed, there should be indirect evidence due to the
effects that heat has on lithics, bones, and even the sediment,
and all of these should remain (Aldeias 2017). When ﬂint is
exposed to heat, color changes can be visible at temperatures
starting at 2507C, a distinctive luster begins to develop at temperatures of approximately 3507C, and crazing can occur starting at 3207C (Julig et al. 1999:838 and citations within; Rottländer 1983). These effects are not limited to objects that are
actually in the ﬁre. A series of actualistic experiments (Sievers
and Wadley 2008; Stiner et al. 1995; Werts and Jahren 2007), as
well as more highly controlled ones (Aldeias 2017; Aldeias et al.
2016), has suggested that the heat from ﬁres can transfer to
underlying sediments, though exactly how far down and the rate
of transfer are dependent on several variables. For example,

Volume 58, Supplement 16, August 2017

ﬁgure 1 below shows the results of two heat experiments at two
different temperatures (9507C and 6007C) at the ground surface,
with additional temperature readings at depths of 2, 6, 10, and
20 cm. Even at the cooler surface temperature of 6007C, objects
2 cm below the surface will heat to 3007C within an hour, and at
higher temperatures and with longer duration, temperatures as
high as 2007C will be reached at even 10 cm below the surface.
Thus, even relatively small and/or brief ﬁres will affect underlying objects.
Instead of simply noting the presence of burned ﬂints in
the two sequences, the number of proximal and complete
pieces showing signs of burning is expressed as a percentage
of all proximal and complete pieces (in both cases counts are
for pieces larger than 2.5 cm; see ﬁg. 2). At both sites the
percentage of burned lithics and fauna decreases through the
sequence, reaching minima of 1%–2% in the upper layers. As
shown in Sandgathe et al. (2011a), the numbers are a function of neither varying sample size nor artifact density. Even
if the direct evidence for the combustion features were removed, it is highly unlikely that the same processes would
remove the objects that were either in direct association with
the ﬁre or embedded in sediments directly below the ﬁre.
At both sites, then, the percentage of burned lithic objects,
which is not subject to preservation issues, generally agrees
with the direct evidence of ﬁre residues in that the use of ﬁre

experiment was run with the surface heat source set at 9507C and again at 6007C. Temperatures were continually recorded at the
ground surface and at 2, 6, 10, and 20 cm beneath the heat source (see Aldeias et al. 2016).

drops off signiﬁcantly, if not completely, during the later
occupations. It can be noted too that the same trends are apparent among the fauna and small ﬁnds. Two notable exceptions are Layers 6 and 8 at Roc de Marsal, where the percentage of heated ﬂints remains high even though there are no
visible hearths in these layers. Although it might be suggested
that the elevated percentage of heated ﬂints might represent
some vertical movement of lithics, there is currently no micromorphological or ﬁeld evidence for this. Likewise, generally
there are some clear time-related patterns in these layers (9–5)
that are not expected if substantial mixing had occurred. The
far more likely explanation is that heat from ﬁres in overlying
layers moved down through the sediments (i.e., the ﬁres in
Layers 5 and 7 modiﬁed some of the lithics of Layers 6 and 8,
respectively; see Aldeias 2017; Aldeias et al. 2016).
It is also unlikely that during the later occupations ﬁres
were constructed at other lateral and as yet unexcavated locations at the sites. At Roc de Marsal, the majority of the site
has now been excavated (when combining our own excavations with the previous excavations of Laﬁlle). The morphology of the cave in relation to the remaining sediments makes it
very unlikely that evidence of ﬁre remains to be detected there
by some future excavation. Our own excavations extended
along the entire length of deposits from well in front of the drip
line to the rear of the cave, as well as laterally across the width
of the cave. If there had been any other ﬁre residues (including
burned ﬂints), they would have been detected. This issue is a
bit more problematic at Pech de l’Azé IV because our own
excavations were concentrated on the western section of the
excavated area, that is, the side that is closest to the original
(and now collapsed) entrance of the cave (Turq et al. 2011).
However, observation of the eastern section remaining from
Bordes’s (1975) earlier excavation clearly indicates the same
level of burning in the basal deposits and a similar lack of such

S281

traces in the upper layers. Furthermore, analysis of Bordes’s
entire collection, which represents a much larger area than our
own, shows an identical pattern of decreasing percentages of
burned lithics through the sequence (see ﬁg. 2). Moreover,
these two excavations were concentrated directly in the middle
of the major part of the deposits, as determined by topographic
relief.
In summary, both Pech IV and Roc de Marsal have excellent preservation, and the correlation is high between the
presence or absence of direct evidence for ﬁre (i.e., ash, charcoal or burned bone, rubeﬁed sediments) and the indirect
evidence of burned artifacts (see Aldeias 2017). This relationship is not surprising given the causal nature of one to the
other, but it means that the presence of ﬁre can be detected
even though various taphonomic processes may have obliterated the more direct evidence. Therefore, in the absence of
both direct and indirect evidence, the conclusion that ﬁre was
not present at particular times during the occupation of these
two sites is much stronger than it would be by relying on the
direct evidence alone. It would seem unavoidable to conclude,
therefore, that, while ﬁre was being used frequently and/or
intensely during the earlier occupations, its use drops to near
zero in the upper occupations. While evidence for the use of
ﬁre does not disappear entirely, on the basis of the very low
frequency of burned ﬂints, this evidence represents an insigniﬁcant aspect of these later occupations.
How Can We Explain These Patterns?
What has been shown is that at these two sites ﬁre was absent
over signiﬁcant periods of time, potentially over thousands of
years of repeated occupation and use of the sites. Is it possible
to argue that how these sites were used changed over time?
The answer to this question would appear to be no. For both
Pech de l’Azé IV and Roc de Marsal, while understanding the
duration and intensity of individual occupation events is
difﬁcult at best, it is clear that these were both consistently
used as occupation sites. The signiﬁcant concentrations of
stone tools (made and used in all components of both sites)
and heavily butchered faunal remains throughout the entire
sequences (Castel et al. 2016; Hodgkins et al. 2016; Niven
2013) are evidence of this. It would be very difﬁcult to argue
that at times, the sites served more ephemeral purposes (e.g.,
that they were kill sites or secondary butchery sites) where the
use of ﬁre may have been less likely. In addition, the alternating
pattern in the basal layers of Roc de Marsal—with ﬁres present
in Layers 5, 7, and 9 and absent in Layers 6 and 8—provides
another argument against ﬁres being associated with only certain kinds of site use (see ﬁgs. 3, 4). Both the burned and unburned layers show virtually identical technological and typological characteristics.
Although faunal data are incomplete for Roc de Marsal, it
is clear that while the prey species varies throughout both site
sequences, the kinds of anatomical elements represented are
virtually indistinguishable in layers with ﬁre versus those

without (see ﬁg. 5; Castel et al. 2016; Hodgkins et al. 2016;
Dibble et al. 2017, pt. 3). Again, this suggests that the presence or absence of ﬁre does not appear to reﬂect changes in
site use. Likewise, while there is no evidence either for or
against the use of ﬁre for cooking, the arguments of Wrangham (2009) concerning the beneﬁts that could be derived from
cooking suggest that if ﬁre were available, it would tend to be
used for this purpose under all circumstances. In other words,

it would be difﬁcult to argue that these Neanderthals simply
changed their tastes in food preparation for millennia.
Since one of the primary uses of ﬁre ethnographically is for
warmth, it is especially ironic that in these two sites the use of
ﬁre drops off signiﬁcantly during colder periods. This pattern
is repeated at several sites in the region where we have comparable data. At Combe-Capelle Bas, which was excavated and
analyzed using identical techniques, there was also no direct

evidence of ﬁre residues, and the percentage of burned ﬂints
remained at !2% for the entire sequence (Dibble and Lenoir
1995). This site, which contains Quina Mousterian assemblages, has been dated to MIS 3 (Valladas et al. 2003) and is
thus contemporary with the nonﬁre occupations from Pech de
l’Azé IV and Roc de Marsal. Similarly, the Quina layers at
Jonzac and La Quina (Bierwirth 1996; McPherron et al. 2006;
Niven et al. 2012) are associated with very high percentages of
reindeer, and the percentage of heated ﬂints is less than 0.5%.
At Jonzac, the Quina layers have been TL dated to MIS 4
(Richter et al. 2013). In the overlying layers at these two sites,
heated ﬂints are never more than 4% of the assemblage, and
they generally are much less. A similar pattern is noted at La
Ferrassie, which exhibits Levallois industries similar to those at
Roc de Marsal, little evidence of ﬁre, and again occupations
occurring during cold periods (Guérin 2015).
One of the best sites in the region for testing a correlation
of ﬁre and climate is Combe Grenal, where some 64 layers
likely represent deposits from late MIS 6 through MIS 3. Data
from Bordes’s collection (the site is currently being reexcavated)
also indicates a correlation between climatic regime and frequency of ﬁre use. This is based on percentages of burned ﬂints
recorded for 23 of the 64 layers identiﬁed by Bordes (Bordes,

Laville, and Paquereau 1966). As can be seen in table 1, there is
a general tendency, with some exceptions, for frequencies of
burned ﬂints to increase in those layers that were identiﬁed,
through associated fauna (see Chase 1986) and sedimentology
(Guadelli and Laville 1988), as being associated with warmer
and wetter climatic periods. These data provide some of the
comparable quantitative data called for by Sorensen (2017) but
contradict his conclusions for this important site based on the
number of observations (e.g., presence of purported ﬁres in
particular layers, heated bedrock, burned bones taken for AMS
dating, TL samples taken for dating, etc.). More work is needed
to reconcile these differences, but it should be emphasized that
comparable proxies on relative scales are preferable to presence
or absence data and that techniques such as micromorphology
and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) are preferable for identifying ﬁre features. This said, we also acknowledge that curation issues with the Combe Grenal collection
may impact proxies based on counting heated ﬂints (Dibble
et al. 2009).
We cannot exclude the possibility that all of these nonﬁre
occupations were limited to summer months and that what
we are seeing at these sites is a switch in seasonality wherein
southwest France was only occupied during warm months. It

would be difﬁcult, however, to imagine that these sites were
consistently used only in one season for the tens of thousands
of years represented by those layers that have little evidence
for ﬁre. That said, even during the warm months, conditions
were still far cooler than today’s and, again, modern huntergatherers in even substantially warmer environments still rely
on ﬁre to warm themselves, especially at night.
For all of these reasons, it was suggested by Sandgathe et al.
(2011a) that the presence or absence of ﬁre was due to the inability to start ﬁres and, therefore that ﬁre would be more likely
to be present when it was naturally available. If the primary
natural source of ﬁres is lightning strikes, then the apparent
pattern seen in these two sites—ﬁres present during warm
periods, absent during cold periods—would reﬂect the fact
that lightning strikes occur more frequently in warmer and
more humid climates and much less frequently in colder and
drier ones.

Obviously, arguments based on negative evidence are fraught
with difﬁculties, and admittedly, there are many potential explanations—both behavioral and natural—for an absence of
evidence for ﬁre in these sites. The hypothesis that this absence
is due to an inability to start ﬁres will require quantitative data
from many other sites that are adequately dated and for which
both indirect and direct evidence for ﬁre is noted (Aldeias et al.
2012; Goldberg et al. 2012; Sandgathe et al. 2011a). This is only a
hypothesis advanced to explain the cyclical pattern apparent in
the data. The more important ﬁnding is that ﬁre is not as
ubiquitous as it should be, given that virtually all recent huntergatherer populations, even prior to access to matches and
lighters, used ﬁre daily for a wide range of applications and at
almost every location where people spend any time at all. Thus,
the main conclusion to be drawn from the evidence at hand is
that use of ﬁre by Western European Neanderthals is sporadic
at best, and for any particular site—even those with relatively
dense or intensive occupations—ﬁre may be virtually absent
for long periods of time. What we are suggesting, therefore, is
that during the European Late Pleistocene there is simply not
enough evidence of ﬁre to assume that Neanderthals used ﬁre,
especially for warmth and for cooking, to a degree equivalent
to that seen among extant humans. At a minimum, this may
mean that ﬁre had a very different role in Neanderthal adaptations in Western Europe than at, say, Kebara, Tabun (Schiegl
et al. 1996; Shimelmitz et al. 2014), or Qesem Cave in Israel
(Barkai et al. 2017) and that there may have been extended
periods of time when ﬁre was not used to a great extent. Thus,
the available data we do have for this region of France indicates
that Neanderthals were not obligate ﬁre users (contra Sorensen
2017), and such evidence might constitute a signiﬁcantly different behavioral adaptation than those seen in more recent
modern human occupations (see Henry 2017).

Implications for Considering the Role of Fire
in Western European Neanderthal Adaptations
The primary focus of this paper is to emphasize the quality of
the data presented to show that ﬁre was not present for long
periods of time in this particular region. We are not arguing
that Neanderthals, as a species, were ﬁre incapable, always ate
raw food, and never used ﬁre for heat. Rather we are simply
presenting quantitative evidence (rather than simple presence
or absence) that at times and for long periods they did not
make extensive use of ﬁre. Admittedly, this is based on only a
few Middle Paleolithic sites, and given the lack of comparable
data available in the literature (see Sandgathe 2017; Sandgathe et al. 2011b; Roebroeks and Villa 2011), it is still unknown to what extent this pattern holds true for many other
times and places during the Pleistocene. But the evidence available from a number of sites is strong enough to make us question
our assumption that once we ﬁnd evidence of ﬁre in the archaeological record, it automatically means that it was an essential part of human behavior and adaptation from that point
forward (cf. Barkai et al. 2017) and throughout the world.

Ice Age Europe without Fire

If this assumption is not valid, and the use of ﬁre was much
more limited than previously believed, this does raise important questions regarding European hominin behavior and
adaptation in the Pleistocene. One of the more important
questions concerns the ability of hominins to survive during
the colder periods. Among modern human groups, it would
be impossible for foragers to inhabit more northerly latitudes
without ﬁre unless they had very well-developed clothing and
shelter technology. However, anatomically modern humans
are relative newcomers to higher latitudes, unlike Neanderthals
who, along with their direct ancestors, have a potential time
depth in Europe of several hundred thousand years. While it is
possible that Neanderthal populations migrated to some extent
in response to major climatic changes and did not always inhabit the most northerly European latitudes during colder
periods (e.g., Roebroeks 2006; Steegmann, Cerny, and Holliday
2002), the presence of signiﬁcant numbers of occupations in
Europe during full glacial conditions indicates that Neanderthals were adapted to such conditions.
The question is to what extent was theirs a physiological
adaptation versus a cultural or technological one? While we
do see the advent of bone needles during the Gravettian of
late MIS 3 and early MIS 2, evidence for tailored clothing
prior to this is virtually nonexistent (Collard et al. 2016). It
has been argued that simply draping or wrapping untailored
animal hides around a person has very limited thermal effectiveness (e.g., Gilligan 2007; Wales 2012). Although there
is ongoing discussion about how much of the difference in
morphology between Neanderthals and their African contemporaries is due to active selective pressures and how much is
mainly due to random genetic drift (e.g., Weaver, Roseman, and
Stringer 2007), it has long been accepted that Neanderthals have
signiﬁcant cold-adapted features such as their short, squat, heavy
bodies with shorter, stockier limbs (e.g., Holliday 1997; Ruff et al.
1993; Steegmann, Cerny, and Holliday 2002; Trinkaus 1981).
Assuming that an absence of ﬁre means an absence of
cooking, there are also implications for Neanderthal energetics. This is an area where Neanderthals differed signiﬁcantly
from anatomically modern humans and one with behavioral
consequences that may have played a role in the replacement
of the former by the latter. It is argued that due to their larger
body mass and unique shape, Neanderthals would have had a
higher basal metabolic rate than anatomically modern humans
and therefore a proportionally larger total energy expenditure
(e.g., Aiello and Wheeler 2003; Sorensen and Leonard 2001;
Steegmann, Cerny, and Holliday 2002). Conservative estimates
suggest a 10% difference between Neanderthals and middle
Upper Paleolithic humans (Churchill and Rhodes 2009; Froehle
and Churchill 2009; Macdonald, Roebroeks, and Verpoorte
2009). This estimate is based on the premise that Neanderthals
and anatomically modern humans derived the same caloric
beneﬁts from the food consumed, and it means that if Neanderthals and early anatomically modern humans had the same
diet composition, Neanderthals would have been obliged to
consume more. This in turn may have necessitated more fre-

S285

quent moves (Macdonald, Roebroeks, and Verpoorte 2009;
Verpoorte 2006).
Moreover, given that cooking raises the nutritional and
energetic value of food (e.g., Carmody and Wrangham 2009;
Wrangham 2009), then an inability to cook their food for
extended periods would further increase the amount of calories required by Neanderthals to meet their daily energetic
needs. Lower overall energy requirements could have given
anatomically modern humans competitive advantages over
Neanderthals in terms of reproductive success and demographic expansion (Froehle and Churchill 2009). There is
considerable evidence that Middle Paleolithic populations
relied particularly heavily on sources of fat in their diet. This
is especially apparent in the breakage of long bones, presumably for the extraction of marrow, and the intense, intentional fragmentation of cancellous bone, presumably to
extract bone grease (Castel et al. 2016; Hodgkins et al. 2016).
In the face of increased caloric requirements for Neanderthals, and especially increased fat requirements, cooking meat
may have taken on an especially important role under certain
conditions.
Besides increasing net caloric returns, cooking can also
reduce the danger presented by bacterial and parasitic loads
in meat. As the evidence from sites like Roc de Marsal and
Pech IV clearly indicates that meat was not always cooked, it
seems likely that consumption of raw meat was relatively
common during the Lower Paleolithic and during at least
certain periods in the Middle Paleolithic. This might not
present any major problems during colder climatic periods
when meat acquired by hominins would tend to remain unspoiled longer and, during some cold periods in some regions,
was likely more easily acquired and in greater quantities due to
the prevalence of large numbers of herd animals like reindeer,
horse, and bison. During warmer climatic periods when the
fauna was dominated by mainly smaller and less gregarious
woodland species (like red deer, roe deer, and wild pigs), meat
was likely generally less available (Hodgkins et al. 2016). Meat
would also tend to spoil faster during warmer periods, and it is
possible that simple meat preservation techniques, like smoking, could have been practiced. However, there is no evidence
for such practices, and it may be that, if meat spoilage was a
consideration for Neanderthals, they were simply cooking it to
make it safe for consumption. Along with increased availability
of natural ﬁre, such a pattern of behavior would also help
explain the apparent association between increased ﬁre use and
warmer climatic periods.

Conclusions
Much of the current evidence suggests that as recently as the
latter half of the Late Pleistocene, Neanderthals were not using
ﬁre all the time, especially not during cold climatic periods.
This raises important questions about how these hominins
were able to adapt to high-latitude glacial conditions both in
terms of their physiology and their technology.

Current Anthropology

Roebroeks and Villa (2011) make an important point that
there is no evidence supporting the idea that ﬁre was requisite
to the initial colonization of Europe. Although they conclude
that the use of ﬁre became “habitual” during the European
Middle Paleolithic, the data from Roc de Marsal and Pech IV
show that hominins occupied or used these sites for long periods
of time without using ﬁre. Whether or not these results are
applicable to the entire European Middle Paleolithic is currently
unknown, since quantiﬁed data (rather than simply presence or
absence), both direct and indirect, on the degree of ﬁre use is
largely unreported (see Sandgathe 2017). The same problem
applies to the Upper Paleolithic as well. For a long time, it has
been assumed that once the advantages of ﬁre were discovered,
its use would spread quickly. But as the evidence is examined
more closely, and as we try to evaluate the degree of ﬁre use, it is
becoming fair to say that we simply do not know when ﬁre use
became a regular, integral, and, eventually, necessary component of hominin adaptations.
