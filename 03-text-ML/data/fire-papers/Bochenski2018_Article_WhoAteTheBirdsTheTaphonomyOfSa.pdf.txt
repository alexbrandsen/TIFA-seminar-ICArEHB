Abstract The taphonomic analysis of avian remains from
Sarakenos Cave reveals that, contrary to previous suggestions,
many bird bones excavated there represent food remains of the
Eagle Owls rather than humans. The conclusion is based on
the presence of traces of digestion, beak and claw punctures,
and indirect evidence that includes relative preservation of
particular elements, species composition, the lack of cut
marks, and the absence of numerous traces of burning.
Specimens with medullary bone and traces of digestion indicate that the owls killed breeding females in spring. Since it is
unlikely that owls shared the cave with humans at the same
time, it supports the notion based on archeological evidence
that human groups did not inhabit it permanently.

Introduction
Sarakenos Cave is the largest of numerous caves on the shore
of the former Kopais Lake, Boeotia, Greece (Fig. 1). The lake
was (partly) drained several times—the first time in the

fourteenth century BC and permanently in the twentieth century AD. Sarakenos Cave is situated at an elevation of about
100 m above the level of the former lake; the entrance to the
cave, which is facing southwest, is 25 m broad and 3–4 m high
and provides good light in the cave and an unobstructed view
toward the Kopais basin (Kaczanowska et al. 2016b; Sampson
2008a). In the recent past, the cave was used as a sheep pen,
which resulted in a layer of dung covering the floor.
Archeological records indicate that Sarakenos Cave was
visited sporadically by human groups during the Final
Paleolithic, but it changed during the Mesolithic and
Early Neolithic when human visits were more frequent
(Kaczanowska et al. 2016a). The results of the first exploration
of the cave that began in the 1970s (Spyropoulos 1973) were
never published and the stratigraphical data were lost.
Systematic excavations in Sarakenos Cave have been conducted since the mid-1990s (Sampson 2008b; Sampson et al. 2009,
2010; Kaczanowska et al. 2016b). The stratigraphic sequence
was reconstructed in trench A where 12 layers were distinguished, Middle Paleolithic (12–11), Final Paleolithic (10–5),
Mesolithic (4), Initial Neolithic (3), Early Neolithic (2), and
younger deposits (Late Neolithic, Early Bronze Age). Layers
10–2 yielded several thousand animal bones. The most numerous animal remains in the Final Paleolithic and Mesolithic
deposits (10–4) were those of birds followed by rodents,
whereas in the Neolithic layers (3–2), medium-sized ruminants
predominated. Molluscs, fish, amphibians, and reptiles were
scarce in all layers (Wilczyński et al. 2016a, b).
Layers 10–5 (Final Paleolithic) formed between
12,220 ± 60 and 9940 ± 60 BP. Over this period, the cave
was visited several times by Epigravettian hunters, whose
traces were recorded in the form of a small series of artifacts,
numbering from 3 to 40 pieces, depending on the layer, and a
small number of mammal bones including European hare
(Lepus europaeus), wild ass (Equus hydruntinus), aurochs

(Bos primigenius), and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Bird remains,
especially those of the rock partridge (Alectoris graeca) and
pigeons (Columba cf. livia), were much more numerous. In
the uppermost part of the Final Paleolithic sequence (layer 5),
a horizon of hearths was recorded.
The formation of the Mesolithic layer (4) took place between 8590 ± 50 (bottom) and the interval between 7780 ± 40
and 7950 ± 40 BP (top). Despite its considerable thickness,
traces of human visits are very modest in layer 4 and represent
a specific flake industry, different from the majority of
Mesolithic industries known from continental Greece and resembling rather the lithic phase VII from Franchthi Cave
(Perlès 1990). Bones of mammals which were hunted were
scarce in layer 4; they included European hare, wild boar, and
Cervidae. Numerous bird remains included mainly pigeons
and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Micromorphological analysis
of this layer revealed the presence of a considerable amount of
plant remains. Layers 4 and 3 were separated by a hearth
horizon, which produced a small number of artifacts.
Of particular interest are the contents of layer 3, which
formed between 7960 ± 40 (boundary between layers 3 and
4) and 7570 ± 50 BP (boundary between 2 and 3). The lithic
inventory from that layer represents a local flake tradition, a
result of adaptation to local raw materials of poor quality (silicified limestone and quartz), but at the same time, single
obsidian blades are present and bones of domesticated animals
(Capra hircus/Ovis aries—goat/sheep) are vastly predominant among mammal remains. This, as well as the discovery
of single fragments of pottery, suggests possible contacts with
groups distinguished by a food-producing economy. Pigeons
predominated among the scarce bird remains.

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2018) 10:1603–1615

The Early Neolithic in the fully developed form is represented by the finds from layer 2, dated between 7570 ± 50 and
7400 ± 35 BP. In that period, the cave served as a short-term
shelter for herdsmen. Mammal remains from this layer are
predominated by goat/sheep (C. hircus/O. aries), with trace
amounts of bones belonging to cattle (Bos taurus) and domestic pig (S. scrofa f. domestica). Bird remains were scarce;
pigeons dominated them. In terms of taxonomy, pottery and
lithic artifact layer 2 refers to Early Neolithic communities
from Thessaly.
Altogether, five trenches (A, B, C, D, and E) were excavated in Sarakenos Cave (Kaczanowska et al. 2016b; Sampson
et al. 2009). Environmental and climatic changes that are
reflected in the species composition were already summarized
in a previous study based on remains from trench A
(Wilczyński et al. 2016a, b). Here, we focus on the taphonomy
of the bird remains and we include remains excavated so far
from trenches A and D, i.e., those with reliable stratigraphy.
The goal of the paper is to establish the most likely agent that
was responsible for the accumulation of avian bones at
Sarakenos Cave. Were the birds hunted and eaten by humans
or raptors, or did they die of natural causes?

Material and methods
A total of 3890 avian remains were recovered from Sarakenos
Cave. Most of them were found in trench A (number of identified specimens (NISP) = 2928), and the remaining come
from trench D (NISP = 962). All skeletal elements are represented, including vertebrae and phalanges. The remains date
from the Paleolithic through Neolithic and they represent 88
taxa (Wilczyński et al. 2016a; unpublished data from trench
D) that were identified using the comparative skeletal collection at the Institute of Systematics and Evolution of Animals,
PAS, in Krakow and identification manuals (Bochenski and
Tomek 2009; Tomek and Bochenski 2000, 2009). For the
purpose of this study, we discarded all unidentified bones
and those with uncertain dating. Moreover, for the sake of
uniformity, we limited our study to more numerous taxonomic
and skeletal groups (major long bones of more numerous
groups of birds; see below), which left us with well over
2000 specimens to study. Other avian taxa (grebes,
charadriforms, rails, bitterns, and coraciforms) were too
scanty to allow a meaningful analysis.
We distinguished six taxonomic groups of birds that include taxa of similar size, appearance, and habits and for the
sake of simplicity called them by short English names that—
from the point of view of avian systematics—are not always
strictly correct: (i) BDucks^—two thirds of the remains
belonged to ducks (Anatidae) of the genera Anas, Aythya,
Melanitta, and Bucephala and one third of the remains represented the coot Fulica atra which belongs to Rallidae but is

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2018) 10:1603–1615

often mistaken for a duck due to its habits and general appearance; (ii) BPartridges^—genera Alectoris and Perdix; (iii)
BPigeons^—almost all remains belonged to the genus
Columba, usually to C. livia, but some bones of Streptopelia
are also included; (iv) BCorvids^—the group includes only the
jackdaw Corvus monedula and choughs of the genus
Pyrrhocorax; other corvids were excluded from the taphonomic analysis because they do not nest in caves; (v)
BStarlings^—Sturnus probably S. vulgaris, but other starling
species were usually not excluded; and (vi) BPasserines^—
technically speaking, corvids and starlings are also passerines,
but this group includes only small species of the genera
Alauda, Calandrella, Carduelis, Coccothraustes, Emberiza,
Eremophila, Fringilla, Galerida, Hirundinidae, Lanius,
Melanocorypha, Montifringilla, Parus, Petronia, and
Phoenicurus.
Although not very numerous and not quite homogenous,
remains of diurnal birds of prey and owls form an additional
group that we decided to study to see whether raptors were
also preyed upon by other raptors, hunted by people, or died a
natural death at the site.
Eight types of long bones were analyzed, which are coracoid, humerus, ulna, radius, carpometacarpus, femur,
tibiotarsus, and tarsometatarsus. Only in the case of
Passerines was the radius not identified to species, and therefore, it was not included in the analysis of that group of birds.
The presence of other skeletal elements was only noted, but
we did not study them in detail.
The humerus and tibiotarsus of two most numerous prey
groups (Partridges and Pigeons) were checked for possible
breakage patterns typical of the Eagle Owl. The owls tend to
cut off the proximal part of the humerus and tibiotarsus and
leave the shaft attached to the distal parts (De Cupere et al.
2009).
Bone ratio of the wing to leg elements was calculated as the
number of wing elements (humerus, ulna, carpometacarpus)
divided by the sum of wing and leg elements (femur,
tibiotarsus, tarsometatarsus), expressed as a percent (Ericson
1987; Livingston 1989).
All remains were examined under a light microscope using
strong directional light to find any possible surface modifications done by humans (cut marks, traces of burning) and animals (traces of digestion, punctures and perforations,
gnawing marks). The marrow cavities of broken long bones
were checked for possible medullary bone that would indicate
females during egg laying (Serjeantson 1998, 2009; Van Neer
et al. 2002), but no bones were snapped on purpose and no
drilling on complete bones was performed. Based on the relative porosity of bone surface, each specimen was also classified into one of the following two categories: fully ossified
(adult) or not fully ossified (subadult or immature).
Color alterations of bones may represent traces of burning
(Stiner et al. 1995), and therefore, all such instances were

1605

recorded. Only carbonized bones that were black not only
on the surface but also throughout the thickness of the bone
were considered as traces of burning; speckled and patchy
discolorations that were present only on the bone surface were
recorded as mineral staining (Stiner et al. 1995). Burn color
codes described by Stiner et al. (1995) were used to describe
the extent of burning damage of particular specimens, which
are 0—not burned, 1—slightly burned (localized and <half
carbonized), 2—lightly burned (>half carbonized), and 3—
fully carbonized (completely black). Higher code stages (4–
6) refer to bone calcination (white color) that was not observed
in Sarakenos Cave. Special attention was paid to possible
traces of burning localized on articular ends because they
may indicate dismembering of the carcass prior to grilling;
an articular end of a bone that had been separated from another
bone is exposed directly to the fire, while the rest of the bone is
still covered by meat, skin, and feathers (Cassoli and
Tagliacozzo 1997; Cain 2005; Laroulandie 2005a;
Bochenski and Tomek 2010).
Traces of digestion on proximal and distal epiphyses and
also on diaphysis can be in the form of pits, holes, or perforations with rounded edges; the surface of breakage affected by
digestion is also smooth, thinned, and rounded—it may look
like a piece of plastic where the edges have melted in heat
(Bochenski and Tomek 1997; Bochenski 2005). Breakages
of the shaft were considered altered through digestion even
if only their portions were rounded because it may well have
happened that a part of the bone broke off after the bone had
been deposited. Although the effects of soil corrosion are similar to digestion, they can be distinguished from digestion by
their lack of specific localization on the bone—corrosion can
be found all over the bone, whereas digestion affects mostly
articular ends and breakage surfaces (Andrews 1990;
Bochenski and Tomek 1997; Fernandez-Jalvo and Andrews
1992).
It has been shown that punctures or perforation of bones
made with claws and/or beaks of raptors while handling their
prey are found on many skeletal elements; on long bones, they
are typically located near the articular ends, regardless of the
species of raptor and prey (Bochenski and Tornberg 2003;
Bochenski et al. 2009; Laroulandie 2000, 2002).

Results
All skeletal elements—including long bones, axial skeleton,
vertebrae, and phalanges—were found at Sarakenos Cave.
Sterna or pelves were represented by small fragments, whereas long bones were somewhat better preserved. The only body
parts that were extremely scarce were the cranial elements
(brain case, beak, and mandible). Two thirds of the 2328 remains retrieved from the assemblage belonged to two taxonomic groups, which are Partridges (NISP = 800) and Pigeons

1606

(NISP = 764). Three taxonomic groups—Corvids, Starlings,
and Passerines—yielded about 200 specimens each, whereas
Ducks provided only a little more than a hundred remains
(data pooled for all bones and periods; Table 1).
All skeletal elements, regardless of the taxonomic group
and period, are heavily fragmented. Many remains show
cracks, are rather fragile, and need to be handled carefully;
in fact, fresh breakages were often observed. Complete specimens make up only 22% (NISP = 503) of all the bones examined (NISP = 2328; Table 1). The least fragmented element
was the carpometacarpus (53% of all carpometacarpi were
complete), followed by the coracoid (30% complete) and the
tasometatarsus (27% complete; data pooled for all taxa and
periods). The most heavily affected element was the
tibiotarsus (1% complete), followed by the radius (7% complete) and the femur (10% complete). Particular taxonomic
groups differed in the degree of breakage; Corvids and
Ducks yielded very few complete bones (10 and 12%, respectively), Pigeons and Partridges had approximately twice as
many complete bones (19 and 20%, respectively), whereas
the highest share of complete bones was among Starlings
and Passerines (36 and 41%, respectively; data pooled for all
elements and periods). Regarding the three periods distinguished, the Paleolithic and Neolithic are similar in the degree
of breakage (19 and 23% of complete long bones, respectively), whereas the Mesolithic showed somewhat better preservation (28% complete; data pooled for all taxa and skeletal
elements).
In Partridges, most proximal ends of the humerus and
tibiotarsus were separated from the shaft just below the articulation, whereas the distal ends were usually connected to the
remaining shaft (Fig. 2). In Pigeons, the fragmentation was
more complicated; most proximal ends of the humerus were
preserved in a similar manner as in Partridges (i.e., without
adjoining shaft), but no clear pattern was visible in distal humerus (fragments with shaft were equally numerous as those
without it). In the tibiotarsus, both ends (proximal and distal)
preserved better with shaft.
Wing elements predominated over leg elements in all but
one taxonomic group; in Passerines, the preponderance was
extremely high, whereas in other groups, it was high to moderate (Fig. 3). The only taxonomic group with a reverse tendency (leg bones slightly predominated) was the Corvids.
Perforations attributable to claws and/or beaks of raptors
were recorded on average in 5% of remains (data pooled for
all taxa, skeletal elements, and periods; Table 2 and Fig. 4).
Remains of four taxonomic groups (Ducks, Partridges,
Corvids, and Starlings) were affected by perforation in the
same degree (4% each), whereas two other groups showed
somewhat higher degree of perforation (Pigeons—6%,
Passerines—8%; data pooled for all skeletal elements and
periods). No differences in the degree of perforation were
observed between particular periods; on average, 5% of bones

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2018) 10:1603–1615

were perforated in the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic
(data pooled for all taxa and skeletal elements). There are
some differences between particular skeletal elements. Wing
elements tend to be more often perforated than the leg bones
(humerus—15%, ulna—8%, and carpometacarpus—5% versus femur—3%, tibiotarsus—2%, and tarsometatarsus—2%;
data pooled for all taxa and periods). More than half (51%) of
all perforations were located on proximal ends of bone, with
distal ends and shafts being less frequently affected (31 and
21%, respectively; data pooled for all taxa and skeletal elements). In a few cases, perforations were located on the edge
of broken bones that originated from the same specimen—
they took the form of semi-circular indentations on each corresponding fragment, and they were recognizable only when
the two fragments of bone were fitted together (Fig. 4b, d).
Traces of digestion were recorded on 38% of remains (data
pooled for all skeletal elements, taxa, and periods; Table 2 and
Fig. 5). On average, such traces were less frequently observed
on wing bones than on leg elements (humerus—37%, ulna—
40%, carpometacarpus—39% versus femur—54%,
tibiotarsus—45%, tarsometatarsus—31%). Traces of digestion were recorded on both articular ends (proximal and distal)
and on the surface of breakage but were nearly absent on
shafts (data pooled for all skeletal elements, taxa, and periods).
The share of remains affected by digestion decreased with the
age, Paleolithic (42%), Mesolithic (29%), and Neolithic (19%;
data pooled for all taxa and skeletal elements). Remains of
particular taxonomic groups were affected by digestion in
similar extent, ranging between 33% (Corvids) and 43%
(Ducks); the only exception were Starlings, whose remains
were more seldom affected (24%; data pooled for all skeletal
elements and periods).
Regarding possible traces of human activity, not a single
cut mark was recorded on any specimen. Color alteration of
bone (black bones, brownish or blackish patches or spots) was
observed on several dozen specimens, but only eight bones
were carbonized and therefore could be treated as burned (data
pooled for all taxa, skeletal elements, and periods; Fig. 6). The
burned bones come from all three periods (Table 3). It is worth
noting that two of the eight burned bones also had traces of
digestion (Fig. 7c, d).
Medullary bone was recorded in 11 specimens that include
Partridges (2), Pigeons (3), Corvids (4), Starlings (1), and
Passerines (1). The bones were retrieved from all three periods, which are Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, and
they represent four various types of elements, which are scapula (1), ulna (4), femur (2), and tibiotarsus (4) (Table 4 and
Fig. 7a, b). Four fragments with medullary bone (Partridges,
Pigeons, and Corvids) also had traces of digestion.
On average, 8% of the remains (NISP = 189) were not fully
ossified and therefore represented immature or subadult individuals (data pooled for all taxa, skeletal elements, and
periods; Table 5). Three taxonomic groups (Partridges,

Paleolithic (5%), more than twice as great in the Mesolithic
(13%), and even higher in the Neolithic (17%). Subadult specimens of diurnal birds of prey were found only in the
Paleolithic (at least 3 species, NISP = 13), and they
outnumbered subadult remains of owls that were found in
the Paleolithic and Mesolithic (2 species, NISP = 3).
Eight taxa of diurnal birds of prey and six taxa of owls were
recorded at Sarakenos Cave (Table 6). A great majority of the
remains were retrieved from the Paleolithic levels. Traces of
digestion were observed on 46% of all the remains and perforations on 10% (data pooled for all taxa, skeletal elements, and
periods). Neither cut marks nor any traces of burning were
recorded on these specimens.

Pigeons, and Corvids) provided relatively many unossified
remains, but only the latter two were recorded in all three
periods. The share of subadult Ducks,Starlings, and
Passerines was very small. The share of immature specimens
increased with the archeological age; it was lowest in the

six taxonomic groups distinguished in Sarakenos Cave

The species composition in Sarakenos Cave is noteworthy.
The number of avian species retrieved from each individual
period was high or very high (Paleolithic—78, Mesolithic—
41, Neolithic—19), and the species ranged from tits and other
small passerines, through medium-sized pigeons and partridges to relatively large ducks and birds of prey (Wilczyński et al.
2016a; unpublished data from trench D). While it is rather
unlikely that Final Paleolithic people hunted many small birds
for food, they could exploit birds of medium and large size
such as pigeons, partridges, or ducks (Serjeantson 2009). In
fact, it has already been suggested that Final Paleolithic inhabitants of Sarakenos Cave were responsible for the accumulation of partridge remains and waterfowl (Kaczanowska et al.
2016a; Wilczyński et al. 2016a, b). Yet, the previous studies
based the assumptions solely on the fact that partridges and
waterfowl were relatively numerous in the sediment and caves
are outside the habitat range of the taxa—no hard evidence
was reported. Therefore, we decided to address the problem in
greater detail.
Direct evidence of human activity that can be found on
avian bones includes cut marks and traces of burning
(Laroulandie 2005b; Serjeantson 2009). In the case of avian
remains, cut marks are recorded relatively seldom even if other lines of evidence indicate that the birds in question are
human food remains (Serjeantson 2009; Steadman et al.
2002). Such sites as La Vache (Laroulandie 2005a) or Taï 2
(Louchart and Soave 2002) with high percentages of remains
with cut marks are rare. Cuts on avian bones tend to be more
frequent on Paleolithic sites that are located in high latitudes
because carcasses may have been dried or frozen at the time
that they were butchered (Serjeantson 2009, p. 163). Since
Sarakenos Cave is located in southern Europe, the lack of
cut marks on avian remains may not necessarily mean that
people were not involved.
The eight carbonized bones may represent fire-induced
changes. The remaining specimens with brownish or blackish

patches probably result from mineral staining such as manganese and/or iron oxides (Shahack-Gross et al. 1997) and thus
have nothing to do with fire. Even the bones that were damaged by fire could have been burned accidentally because they
happened to have been buried in close proximity to a later fire
(Stiner et al. 1995). The very low rate of possible burning in
present study would be also consistent with accidental burning
(Stiner and Munro 2011). A crucial aspect of the present interpretation is that two of the eight carbonized remains also
had traces of digestion. Obviously, the bones were first
swallowed and exposed to digestive juices of predators and
only later were discolored by fire.
The very high degree of fragmentation of avian remains in
Sarakenos Cave makes any analysis of relative preservation
difficult. For a long time, the remains were exposed to trampling by people who frequently visited the cave and also by
sheep and goat that were kept there in later times (Sampson
2008a). Therefore, many remains have been broken after they
had been deposited, which additionally hampers taphonomic
analyses. For this reason, we decided to check only the most
frequently applied wing versus leg element ratio and skip the

form of extensive pitting of distal

rounding of broken shaft edges of
another humerus. All bones

digestion, a distinct perforation is

part (b)

others. The wing/leg ratio is believed to differentiate between
human food remains where meat-rich leg bones prevail and
natural decomposition factors where leg bones are underrepresented (Ericson 1987). Avian remains derived from owl
pellets and uneaten food remains of diurnal raptors are characterized either by an equal proportion of the wing and leg
elements or—more often—by the predominance of wing elements (Bochenski 2005; Lloveras et al. 2014). Although
heavily fragmented and therefore more prone to misinterpretation, the remains from Sarakenos Cave fit the Bowl pellet^
category. Certainly, they differ considerably from the human
food remains because leg elements in Sarakenos are in minority. Wing elements also prevailed among bird remains from
the Roman bath complex in Sagalassos, Turkey, and subAtlantic deposits in the Ural Mountains—both of which were
attributed to the Eagle Owl (De Cupere et al. 2009; Bochenski
and Nekrasov 2001, respectively). The fact that remnants of
many skeletal elements, including vertebrae and phalanges,
were recorded at the site also indirectly supports their owl or
diurnal raptor pellet origin (Bochenski 2005; Lloveras et al.
2014), while the almost total lack of cranial elements suggests

the Eagle Owl, which is known to decapitate its prey prior to
swallowing (Glutz von Blotzheim and Bauer 1980; Bochenski
et al. 1993).
The fragmentation of the humerus and tibiotarsus of
Partridges follows the pattern produced by the Eagle Owls
(De Cupere et al. 2009). The proximal part of the humerus is
typically cut off at its base, which coincides with the location of
perforations or holes made by the owl’s beak (see next paragraph). This is the way the Eagle Owl separates the wings from
the main body of its prey (Bochenski 1960; Bochenski et al.
1993). It is hard to say why in Pigeons the pattern does not
work so well (only the proximal humerus agrees with this pattern). One of the possible explanations is that not all Pigeons
were preyed upon by Eagle Owls; some may have died in the
cave of natural reasons and their bones preserved differently.
Here, we can only speculate; more studies on more numerous
remains would be necessary to solve the problem.
Qualitatively, perforation of bones observed in Sarakenos
Cave is consistent with perforations done by owls and diurnal
raptors; the shape and size of holes correspond to those made
by contemporary owls and raptors (Bochenski and Tornberg
2003; Bochenski et al. 2009; Laroulandie 2000, 2002). Also,
the location of punctures on long bones (near the articular
ends) agrees with those made by both modern raptors and

In brackets are burn color codes according to the classification of Stiner
et al. (1995)

owls (see above citations) including those of the Eagle Owl
from the Roman baths in Turkey (De Cupere et al. 2009). The
humerus was the most frequently affected bone both in
Sarakenos Cave and in food remains of various species of
owls and diurnal raptors. The only difference is in the percentage of punctured bones; in Sarakenos Cave, the percentage
was rather low, which can be (partly) explained by the high
degree of fragmentation (perforated bones may have suffered
more fragmentation).
Traces of digestion in Sarakenos Cave correspond well
with those made by owls (Bochenski 2005; Bochenski and
Tomek 1997; Bochenski et al. 1998). They are observed on
articular ends of long bones and on the surface of breakages,
whereas shafts are not affected. The degree of digestion damage is much larger in remains extracted from pellets of diurnal
raptors (Bochenski 2005; Lloveras et al. 2014). A similar pattern of damage through digestion was also observed on Eagle
Owl food remains from the Roman bath complex in
Sagalassos, Turkey (De Cupere et al. 2009).
Remains of diurnal birds of prey and owls do not differ
from other avian remains found in Sarakenos Cave. Bones
of raptors and owls were affected by perforation and digestion
in similar proportions to remains of other birds, which suggests that they were deposited by the same agent(s). The most
probable species responsible for the accumulation of raptor
and owl remains is the Eagle Owl, which may nest at the
entrance to caves and which hunts other species of owls and
many diurnal raptors that try to share its range (Cramp et al.
1985). In fact, our results from Sarakenos Cave agree with
those of a study of the diet and nest site characteristics of the
Eagle Owl in northern Greece (Papageorgiou et al. 1993). The
southwestern exposure of the entrance to the cave is preferred
by the Eagle Owls. Also, the reported diet includes many
species recovered from Sarakenos Cave, including some of
the diurnal raptors and owls (Papageorgiou et al. 1993).
The specimens that are not fully ossified represent birds
that must have bred locally. Some of them could even have
nested in Sarakenos Cave (pigeons, owls, choughs, jackdaws),
and they may have died there of natural causes. In fact, the

large proportion of young chough remains, together with the
fact that no cut marks or other human-derived evidence was
recorded, was interpreted in favor of natural death in the rock
shelter of Vaufrey, France (Laroulandie 2000, p. 175).
Although this may well have been the case in Sarakenos
Cave, an alternative explanation is also possible; young,

inexperienced birds would also be an easy prey of owls—
similarly to predator-naïve juvenile hares that are preyed upon

NISP number of identified specimens

by the Great Horned Owls in North America (Rohner and
Krebs 1996).
Medullary bone is found in the bones in females just before
and during the time of lay. In the domestic chicken, it is most
common in the femur and tibiotarsus and least common in the
tarsometatarsus and humerus (Serjeantson 2009; Van Neer
et al. 2002), but it is rarely observed in wild species on
archeological sites (Serjeantson 2009). Our study confirms
that medullary bone is often laid down in the tibiotarsus of
wild species and that it happens in other elements including
the ulna and scapula, but our sample was too small to draw farreaching conclusions. To the best of our knowledge, the four
fragments with medullary bone that also had traces of digestion are probably the first bones ever reported that bear simultaneously the two conditions. They indicate that the breeding
females were hunted by the owls that nested and/or roosted in
Sarakenos Cave. Since breeding season takes place in spring,
we can conclude that humans did not visit the cave at that time
because it is very unlikely that any owl would nest in the cave
while it was used by people. Of course, people could have
visited Sarakenos Cave in spring but not in the same years
as the owls, which agrees with the notion that human groups
only visited the cave but not inhabited it permanently
(Kaczanowska et al. 2016b). Indeed, the seasonality of occupation suggested by dental cementum analysis of the sheep/

goat teeth that had partially complete annual growth bands
indicates that the visits of human groups evidenced in layers
3 and 2 took place in summer or at the spring/summer transition (Wilczyński et al. 2016b), but for reasons mentioned
above, it does not contradict our results.
Our results suggest that bird remains from Sarakenos Cave
are more likely to have been deposited by owls rather than
diurnal birds of prey, mammalian carnivores, or humans.
Diurnal raptors can be excluded because animal remains in
their pellets are nearly always heavily digested (Bochenski
2005; Lloveras et al. 2014), which was not the case in
Sarakenos Cave. Mammalian carnivores consume bones or
at least heavily damage them and leave bite marks (Andrews
1990), which we did not observe on the remains. Likewise, we
did not manage to find much evidence of human-induced
modifications on the avian bones; the eight carbonized bones
could have been burned accidentally. The moderate degree of
digestion, punctures in bones, predominance of wing elements, and rich species composition indicate owls. The species of owls that occur in Greece include the Barn Owl Tyto
alba, Common Scops Owl Otus scops, Eagle Owl Bubo bubo,
Little Owl Athene noctua, Tawny Owl Strix aluco, Long-eared
Owl Asio otus, Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus, and
Tengmalm’s Owl Aegolius funereus (Lambert 1957). With
the exception of the Eagle Owl, all other owls feed mainly

1614

on small animals and they take larger prey only exceptionally
(Cramp et al. 1985; Alivizatos et al. 2005). On the other hand,
the Eagle Owl prefers prey of medium size such as pigeons
and partridges that dominate the avian assemblage of
Sarakenos Cave. In fact, the diet of the Eagle Owl includes
enormous range of bird species from small passerines that are
taken rather infrequently up to full-grown herons and birds of
its own species (Cramp et al. 1985; Papageorgiou et al. 1993).
All the lines of evidence taken together strongly suggest that
the most likely raptor responsible for the accumulation of
many of the remains is the Eagle Owl that would have nested
and/or roosted at the entrance to the cave. Smaller owl species
that prey upon smaller prey could also occasionally contribute
to the assemblage. Some individuals of cave-dwelling species
like pigeons, choughs, or owls could have died of natural
reasons. Also, some remains could represent human food remains but we are unable to prove it.
Our proposition to explain the predominance of avifauna
among animal remains with causes other than those related to
bird hunting by human groups visiting the cave corresponds
well with the modest amount of material relics left by these
groups. This leads us to the conclusion that during the Final
Paleolithic and Mesolithic, the cave was only incidentally
used as a short-term hunting shelter, while in the Initial and
Early Neolithic, it played the role of a short-term shelter for
herdsmen. It is not before the Middle Neolithic that we have
evidence for the cave having been used as a cult site.
