It was recently found that silcrete raw material was heat-treated during the South African Middle Stone Age
(MSA) for altering its ﬂaking properties. This ﬁnding led to hypotheses about the implications for the MSA
hunter-gatherers such as the cost of thermal treatment in terms of investment and ﬁrewood. To date, these
hypotheses lack a solid basis, for data on the thermal transformations of South African silcrete and, hence,
the necessary heating procedure and heating environment, is missing. In order to produce such data, we
conducted an experimental study within the framework of the Diepkloof project. This work is based on the
petrographic, mineralogical and structural analysis of South African silcrete from the West Coast and its
thermal transformations. Our results shed light on the nature of these transformations, the ideal heating
temperatures and the tolerated heating speed. The processes occurring in silcrete are comparable to ﬂint, i.e.
the loss of chemically bound ‘water’ and the formation of new SieOeSi bonds, but their intensity is less
pronounced. Effective heating temperatures are signiﬁcantly higher than for ﬂint and the heating speed
tolerated by South African silcrete is relatively fast. These ﬁndings imply that silcrete heat treatment cannot
be directly compared with ﬂint heat treatment. Unlike ﬂint, heating silcrete does not require the setup of
a dedicated heating environment and may have been performed in the same time as other ﬁre related
activities. This would represent only a minor supplementary investment in time and ﬁrewood. These results
have broad implications for the discussion about technological evolution and the acquisition of specialised
knowledge in the MSA.

1. Introduction
The South African Middle Stone Age (MSA) corresponds to a set
of technological and behavioural innovations comparable to, but
predating, those of the European Upper Palaeolithic by several tens
of thousands of years. These innovations include the production of
composite tools and complex hafting materials (Charrié-Duhaut
et al., 2013; Wadley et al., 2009), the production of bone points
(Backwell et al., 2008), and the use of symbolic expression

(Henshilwood et al., 2004, 2002; Texier et al., 2010; Texier et al.,
2013). However, the exact moment of their appearance and the
mechanisms behind these innovations remain subject to discussion
(Klein, 1995; Jacobs and Roberts, 2009; McBrearty and Brooks,
2000; Tribolo et al., 2013; Porraz et al., 2013). The intentional
transformation of raw material used for the production of stone
tools seems to have been a part of this phenomenon.
It has recently been shown that the South African MSA yielded
the earliest known traces of heat treatment of raw material for tool
production (Brown et al., 2009; Mourre et al., 2010). Lithic heat
treatment is the controlled transformation of a material’s properties by the inﬂuence of heat. It can therefore be considered as one of
the ﬁrst procedures man used to intentionally alter a material,

3520

hence an evolutionary step requiring intimate knowledge and
control of ﬁre and complex cognitive abilities. It has even been
proposed that heat treatment accounts for the presence of
advanced tools in the African MSA and that it may have created an
advantage for early modern humans during their dispersal into
Eurasia (Brown et al., 2009).
In order to comprehend the implications of these early cases of
heat treatment for behavioural evolution during the MSA, it
appears necessary to understand the challenges faced by the
authors of this process and the cost of its execution in terms of
investment. We therefore propose to investigate the technological
conditions required for the thermal transformation of the rocks
used as raw materials in the South African MSA. This paper contains
a contribution to an improved understanding of MSA lithic technology and is part of a broader study engaged at the site of Diepkloof Rock Shelter (Parkington et al., 2013).
2. Background of the study
2.1. Archaeological background
From the 1960s on, heat treatment of raw material has been
identiﬁed from the Upper Palaeolithic, the Neolithic, the Mesolithic, North American Paleo-Indian groups and some recent and
sub-recent ethnographic descriptions (Crabtree and Butler, 1964;
Bordes, 1969; Tiffagom, 1998; Binder, 1984; Léa, 2005; Kenoyer
et al., 1991; Hester, 1972; Inizan and Tixier, 2001; Eriksen,
2006). Throughout the archaeological record, this process
seems to have been in close association with pressure ﬂaking,
either for the retouch of bifacial tools or the production of blades
and bladelets.
A recent discovery at the South African MSA site of PP5/6 at
Pinnacle Point (Brown et al., 2009) considerably pushes back the
date of the appearance of lithic heat treatment. The authors
concluded that the thermal transformation of silcrete was regularly
practised 72,000 years ago and that it appeared as early as 164,000
years ago. During this study, the majority of the analysed PP5/6
artefacts made on silcrete were found to be heated and, since these
artefacts were recovered from unburned archaeological contexts,
the authors concluded that the heat treatment was intentional.
Whether other rocks, like quartzite, were also heated is not speciﬁed by Brown et al. (2009). Another recent study (Mourre et al.,
2010) also recognised heat treatment of silcrete from the Still Bay
layers at the site of Blombos Cave. At this site, heat treatment was
performed on blanks prior to their shaping, hence consistently
entering into the chaîne opératoire as a supplementary step. As in
later examples from the European Upper Palaeolithic and the
Neolithic, heat treatment in the South African Still Bay also seems to
be in association with pressure ﬂaking (Mourre et al., 2010).
However, it was also documented that ﬂakes were heated prior to
their (rather simple) retouch into denticulates (Mourre et al., 2010),
hence questioning the association of heat treatment with a high
technical investment for elaborate tool shapes.
The discovery of heat treatment in the South African MSA is an
important step towards a better understanding of Pleistocene lithic
technology in southern Africa and the related raw material provisioning strategies. The Howiesons Poort (HP) and, to a lesser extent,
the Still Bay (SB) are technological phases accompanied by the
increasing use of silcrete. These changes in raw material provisioning throughout the MSA reﬂect a modiﬁcation of the territorial
organisation of these populations (Ambrose and Lorenz, 1990).
Brown and Marean (2010) proposed these changes to be related to
the changing availability of ﬁrewood for heat treatment. This
hypothesis rests upon the assumption that heat treatment is
indispensable for silcrete knapping and that heat treatment

requires supplementary ﬁrewood for the setup of a special heating
environment. It would therefore be a supplementary investment
for tool production requiring extra resources and, hence be
economically advantageous only when ﬁrewood is abundant or
when the access to high quality raw material is restricted (Brown
and Marean, 2010).
At Diepkloof Rock Shelter, thermally transformed artefacts
appear in the pre-SB layer ‘Lynn’ and last until the post-HP layers
(Porraz et al., 2013). It appears clear that some silcrete artefacts
were knapped after having been heated but whether the heating
represents an intentional or an accidental step is still to be
demonstrated since combustion residues are widespread
throughout the whole sequence (Miller et al., 2013) and other rock
types, like quartzite, have also been heated (Tribolo et al., 2013).
We believe that determining heat treatment on prehistoric
artefacts needs to be based on archaeometric techniques (some of
which appear to be more appropriate than others) and a broader
technological understanding of the lithic chaîne opératoire. The
implications of the ﬁnding of heat treatment at a given period, the
challenges it dictates to the makers and the adopted solutions can
only be understood through an intimate knowledge of the used
materials and their thermal transformations. The search for the
Pleistocene people’s technological knowledge and its place within
their society must therefore begin with the analysis of the heattreated materials.
2.2. The thermal transformation of silica rocks and the silcrete issue
In order to understand heat treatment of silica rocks, several
authors proposed models explaining their temperature induced
transformations. The implication of secondary elements like iron
oxides were discussed (Purdy and Brooks, 1971; Schindler et al.,
1982) along with internal fracturing (Flenniken and Garrison,
1975) and recrystallisation (Domanski and Webb, 1992). Many of
these models were contradictory, incomplete or simply found to be
incorrect (a more detailed description of past models is given in the
introduction of Schmidt, 2011). More recently, Schmidt et al.
(2012b) proposed a model of the temperature induced crystallographic and structural transformations in length-fast (LF) chalcedony and ﬂint. LF-chalcedony consists of a fabric of nanometresized a-quartz crystallites that are arranged in ﬁbres (Rios et al.,
2001). The quartz c-axis is normal to the ﬁbre axis (Michel-Levy
and Munier-Chalmas, 1892). Flint is predominantly made up of
short intersecting chalcedony ﬁbres. These rocks contain up to
0.7wt% of chemically bound water as SiOH (silanole) and about the
same amount of molecular water (Schmidt et al., 2011) that is
retained in the structure of the rock (i.e. liquid inclusions between
grain boundaries and crystal defects within the quartz crystallites
(Flörke et al., 1982; Graetsch et al., 1985)). Chalcedony is also
a porous rock allowing water circulation throughout its structure
and the amount of water that can be absorbed by open pores
typically builds up z0.25 wt% of the rock (Schmidt et al., 2011).
In order to identify and quantify the transformations undergone
by LF-chalcedony during heat treatment, Schmidt et al. (2012b)
used different techniques including infrared spectroscopy, solid
state NMR, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.
Their results showed that the major transformation is the loss of
silanole and the creation of new bridging SieOeSi bonds according
to the reaction:
SieOH þ HOeSi / SieOeSi þ H2O.

This reaction starts between 200  C and 300  C and causes the
healing of defect sites within crystals and the closing of the rock’s

P. Schmidt et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 40 (2013) 3519e3531

pores. This results in an increase in hardness of the rocks. The
material’s hardness is correlated with its fracture toughness (Le
Bourhis, 2008) improving in this way the ﬂaking properties of the
rock (Schindler et al., 1982; Domanski et al., 1994). The maximal
annealing temperature and ramp rate were found to be functions of
the ability of the structure to evacuate newly created H2O and
depend on the size of the heated specimen and the volume of its
porosity. The heating temperature of medium to large samples
must therefore remain relatively low and the heating speed slow
for the created water to be evacuated before the resulting vapour
pressure at higher temperatures induces internal fracturing and,
hence, failure of the treatment. This need for water evacuation
makes heat treatment of ﬂint a time consuming and difﬁcult task
requiring the setup of a special heating environment that allows for
creating and maintaining very precise conditions.
Thus, a large part of the thermal transformations of ﬂint and
other silica rocks consisting of pure or almost pure LF-chalcedony
seem to be understood. However, heat treatment in the South
African MSA was not performed on such rocks but on silcrete
(Brown et al., 2009). Contrary to marine ﬂint, silcrete is a terrestrial
paedogenic siliciﬁcation that forms by induration of an existing
sediment by micro-cryptocrystalline silica cement (Summerﬁeld,
1983; Wopfner, 1978). The rock is mostly composed of quartz that
is present as grains surrounded by a matrix of micro- to cryptocrystalline quartz (Summerﬁeld, 1983). Its structure is therefore
different from ﬂint leading to differences in its expected thermal
behaviour. These differences need to be understood and a model of
the heat induced transformations in silcrete must be proposed in
order to investigate the role of silcrete heat treatment in the
context of technological adaptations in the MSA.
We present here an approach based on near infrared (NIR)
spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
thermogravimetric (TG) analyses aiming to identify the sample’s
mineralogical content and to measure their content of different
‘water’ species before and after experimental heat treatment. The
role of non-quartz impurities is also discussed. This approach
highlights the structural peculiarities and thermal behaviour of
silcrete used for heat treatment in the MSA.
3. Samples and experimental
3.1. Sampling and sample preparation
All samples were collected during geological survey in the West
Coast area, aiming to document the spatial distribution of silcrete
outcrops and their variability. Fieldwork was conducted within the
framework of the Diepkloof project and is described in detail in
Porraz et al. (2013) (also containing macroscopic descriptions and
photographs of the samples). 57 silcrete outcrops were sampled
from (sub-) primary (N ¼ 45) and secondary (N ¼ 12) positions,
representing the silcrete types found in the archaeological records
of Diepkloof Rock Shelter and some other sites on the West Coast of
the Western Cape region. For the present analysis, eleven samples
were selected from this geological collection. These include specimens from the immediate surroundings of Diepkloof but also from
its south (Malmesbury area) and north (Olifants river mouth).
Samples SA-11-2 and -17A were collected in primary position,
samples SA-11-56, -56b, -61F and -65B in secondary position and
the remaining samples were collected in sub-primary position
(Porraz et al., 2013). Exact sample provenances are summarised in
Fig. 1. Silcrete varieties with different macroscopic characters were
chosen (‘coarse-grained’ and ‘ﬁne-grained’) representing the
diversity of silcrete occurring in the West Coast (Roberts, 2003).
In order to assess the sample’s mineralogical composition by
means of infrared and Raman spectroscopy, all eleven samples

were cut into slabs of a thickness of approximately half a millimetre
and diamond polished on both sides (exact sample thicknesses are
summarised in Table 2). Petrographic thin sections (thickness
30 mm) for microscopic observations in polarised light were cut
from all samples. Additionally, powders with a grain size between 4
and 25 mm were prepared from 6 samples for X-ray powder
diffraction analysis (Table 1). TG analysis was performed on two
fragments weighing z50 mg of samples SA-11-12A and -36. For
better comparability between TG and NIR data, both fragments for
the TG measurements were broken off from the polished slabs used
for the infrared analyses and therefore have the same thickness. In
order to evaluate the maximum tolerated heating speed of the
studied silcrete samples, ﬂakes weighing from 18 to 205 g were
removed from seven of the silcrete samples. Their sample numbers,
masses and volumes are summarised in Table 3.
3.2. Instruments and settings
3.2.1. Mineralogical analysis
In order to assess the mineralogy of the samples, we conducted
analyses using mid-infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Xray powder diffraction and optical microscopy in polarised light.
Petrographic observations were conducted for understanding the
heat treatment related characteristics of the samples. A complete
petrographic evaluation of these samples lies beyond the scope of
this work. Crystal sizes were measured using a screw micrometre
eyepiece at the highest magniﬁcation. Mid-infrared transmission
spectra were acquired by means of direct transmission through the
polished slabs cut from the samples, using unpolarised radiation.
Spectra were recorded between 4000 cm1 and 2500 cm1 with
a spectral resolution of 4 cm1 using a Bruker VECTOR 22 spectrometer. The obtained spectra show the OH region allowing for the

assessment of hydroxylated phyllosilicates (i.e. clay). Mid-infrared
reﬂectivity spectra were acquired on the surface of the slabs,
using the same spectrometer. Reﬂection data was collected
between 2000 cm1 and 350 cm1 with a 2 cm1 spectral resolution, an incidence of 45 and unpolarised radiation. These spectra
show the lattice vibrations of the minerals forming the samples.
Additionally, Raman spectra were acquired on the surface of the
same polished slabs using a Horiba Jobin Yvon HR800 spectrometer
equipped with edge ﬁlters. Spectra were recorded between
50 cm1 and 1200 cm1. The exciting wavelength was the 514 nm
line of an Arþ laser that, in combination with a 2400 lines/mm
grating, results in a spectral resolution better than 0.5 cm1.
Spectrometer calibration was set using the 520.5 cm1 band of a Si
crystal. A 10 objective, producing an exciting spot of approximately 10 mm, was used for spectral acquisition. In addition to the
infrared and Raman data, X-ray powder diffraction data was
collected from six of the samples (see Table 1) before heating using
a Bruker D2 PHASER diffractometer. Diffraction diagrams were
recorded between 0 and 65 2q with a step size of 0.2 s/degree
(using the Ka line of a Cu anode, no incident beam monochromator). The sample holder was in constant rotation during
acquisition.
3.2.2. Analysis of the heat induced transformations
The sample’s H2O and SiOH content as a function of the
annealing temperature was measured by means of near infrared
(NIR) spectroscopy. NIR transmission spectra were recorded at
normal incidence between 5500 and 4100 cm1 with a resolution
of 8 cm1, using the same Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer and
unpolarised radiation. A circular aperture of 12 mm diameter
delimited the analysed area on the slabs. Due to the relatively high
opacity of the silcrete samples, spectral acquisition was repeated
500 times in order to obtain spectra with a sufﬁciently good
signal/noise ratio. This ratio still being low, we also acquired NIR

spectra of all samples in the same spectral region using a Varian
Cary 5000 UVeViseNIR-Spectrometer in diffuse reﬂection mode
on powders with random orientation (spectral resolution 1 nm,
scan rate 600 nm/min). These diffuse reﬂection spectra do not
yield quantitative information but have a signiﬁcantly better
signal/noise ratio. The transmission spectra were then numerically smoothed for data extraction (the comparison with
untreated diffusion spectra helped to avoid excessive smoothing).
The quantitative determination of the silanole and molecular
water contents was calculated from the smoothed transmission
spectra using the molar absorption coefﬁcients given by Scholze
(1960). H2O concentrations were determined using the linear
absorption coefﬁcient a ¼ 1.14 L/mol cm measured at 5430 cm1
and SiOH concentrations were calculated using the integral
absorption coefﬁcient a ¼ 160 L/mol cm2 as discussed in Schmidt
et al. (2011). Baselines for absorbance measurements of the two
combination bands (H2O at 5430 cm1 and SiOH at 4547 cm1)
were straight lines between the two lowest points on either side
of the absorption bands and are shown in Fig. 4. Error bars for the
measured absorptions of a given sample were calculated by
repeating spectral acquisition 30 times on one sample and performing the smoothing process independently. These errors were
found to be mainly a function of the signal/noise ratio (inﬂuenced
by the overall opacity of the slabs) and the sample homogeneity at
different spots across the slabs.
In addition to the NIR measurements, the weight loss as a function of heating temperature was measured using a SETARAM Setsys
Evolution thermo balance. The heat transfer was signiﬁcantly
increased using a platinum crucible and helium atmosphere
allowing for better measurement accuracy. Curves were recorded
between 40 and 1000  C with a heating rate of 1  C/min.
For maximum tolerated heating speed measurements, a Thermolyne 47900 electrical furnace with free access to oxygen was
used.

3.3. Experiments for the thermal analyses
The analyses presented here are based on an approach elaborated by Schmidt et al. (2011) and Schmidt et al. (2012b) using near
infrared spectroscopy and an experimental protocol aiming to
reproduce heat treatment at different temperatures. The sample
slabs were subjected to heat treatment in an electrical furnace
using different temperatures: 110  C, 150  C, 200  C, 250  C, 300  C,

3523

350  C, 400  C, 450  C, 500  C, 550  C and 600  C. Although the
expected transformations are essentially completed after 50 min of
annealing at a given temperature (Fukuda and Nakashima, 2008;
Schmidt et al., 2012b), samples were held at each of these
temperatures for 2 h 30 min. NIR spectra were recorded in the
‘dehydrated state’ immediately after the samples had cooled to
room temperature. The samples were then rehydrated in deionised
H2O for 24 h (at 21  C and 1 bar) and a second spectrum was
acquired in the ‘hydrated state’. After this, the samples were heated
to the next higher temperature and the measuring protocol was
repeated. The ramp rate for all temperature steps was 20  C/min.
This relatively fast heating rate could be sustained for all of the
annealing temperatures used in the experiment. No heat induced
fracturing, crazing or cracking was observed during the
experiments.
This experimental protocol results in three values: [1] the
concentration of water strongly retained in the rocks structure
(H2Ostructure), [2] the silanole (SiOH) concentration and [3] the
concentration of water loosely held in the network of interconnected open pores (H2Oporosity). H2Ostructure and SiOH were
determined in the dehydrated state. H2Oporosity was measures by

subtracting the 5430 cm1 H2O band’s absorption in the dehydrated state spectra from the band’s absorption in the hydrated
state spectra. This value corresponds to water absorbed by open
pores of the rock.
The experimental setup for the maximum tolerated heating
speed measurements was as follows. The electrical furnace was
preheated to 550  C. Once this temperature reached, the furnace
door was opened as fast as possible for a sample to be put in and
then closed again. Because opening of the door caused a temperature drop of approximately 10  C, it was waited until the thermocouple showed again 550  C before introducing the next sample in
the furnace (approx. 2e3 min). Once all seven samples in the
furnace, the temperature was held for 2 h. After this, the furnace
cooled down to room temperature (taking approx. 5 h) before the
samples were inspected and a ﬂake was stuck from each of them so
that a possible deterioration due to overheating could be evaluated.
4. Results
4.1. Mineralogy and petrography of the samples
Petrographic observation of the thin sections reveals the texture
of the samples. All samples are totally siliciﬁed and contain large
quartz grains, measuring from 0.2 to 2 mm (clasts), in varying
proportions. Evaluated volume percentages of clasts in the rocks
are summarised in Table 2. All 4 petrographic texture types
described by Summerﬁeld (1983) (GS ¼ Grain supported,
F ¼ Floating, M ¼ Matrix dominated and C ¼ Conglomeratic) can be
found in the samples (Table 2). The clasts are surrounded by
a cement of microquartz of varying grain size (Fig. 2). The grain size
of this cement is heterogeneous. Two samples show very ﬁne
grained cement with a grain size signiﬁcantly below 5 mm,
appearing almost isotropic under crossed polarisers (SA-11-36 and
-65B). Most samples show cement with a grain size between 10 and
20 mm (Table 2). The cement of all samples contains ﬁnely dispersed
micro-inclusions of yellowish-brown granules with a grain size
near 1 mm. Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction suggest the
granules to consist of anatase (TiO2). Their concentration seems
higher in the ﬁner grained parts of the cements. Other minerals like

K-feldspar, biotite, zircon and amphibole are very scarce. Only Kfeldspar is present as crystals with a size comparable to the quartz
clasts, other minerals are signiﬁcantly smaller.
The mid-infrared reﬂectance spectra show quartz to be the only
phase in all samples. No auxiliary phase can be detected using this
technique. However, this method is able to detect minor constituents of a sample only if these cause infrared bands at frequencies
different from the major phase of the samples. It is noteworthy that
no band at 555 cm1, characteristic of non-bridging SieO in silanole
(Schmidt and Fröhlich, 2011), was observed in the samples. This
suggests the very low hydroxylation of South African silcrete
samples.
The 11 mid-infrared transmission spectra show a broad
absorption band at 3400 cm1 caused by H2O and a shoulder at
3580 cm1 caused by an OeH stretching vibration commonly found
in micro- to cryptocrystalline quartz (Kronenberg, 1994) (Fig. 3).
Five of the spectra also show weak OeH stretching bands caused by
clay (Table 1, Fig. 3). The observed shoulders, caused by single OeH
stretching bands at 3619 cm1, are consistent with clay species like
illite and members of the smectite group (i.e. montmorillonite).
Two other samples show traces of kaolinite or other 1:1 clay
minerals indicated by two OeH stretching bands at 3695 cm1 and
3619 cm1. One sample (SA-11-36) shows traces of an amphibole
related OH stretching vibration at 3675 cm1.
These results are corroborated by Raman spectroscopy. All
samples show the characteristic bands of quartz and an additional
week broad band near 850 cm1 consistent with a clay impurity.
Furthermore, anatase (TiO2) can be detected in all samples through
its characteristic bands at 145 cm1, 397 cm1, 514 cm1 and
639 cm1. Although the micro-Raman analyses are not quantitative,
they nonetheless show the great homogeneity of all analysed silcrete samples that are composed of quartz with anatase and
a minor clay impurity. Furthermore, the quantitative mid-infrared
data allow for evaluating the quantity of clay in the samples.
Based on the thickness of the slabs and the relative intensity of the
clay related OeH bands, the quantity of phyllosilicates can be
estimated to be less than one percent in all samples. No band near
500 cm1, indicating moganite or non-bridging SieO in silanole
(Schmidt et al., 2012a), could be observed.

combination bands used in this study. The 5220 cm1 band is caused by molecular water and the 4547 cm1 band is caused by silanole. The four lower spectra (aed) were
acquired in diffuse reﬂection mode and did not undergo any data treatment. The four upper spectra (eeh) were acquired in direct transmission and underwent numerical
smoothing. Smoothing of the transmission spectra was carefully performed so that the H2O and SiOH bands preserved the absorption frequencies and relative band shapes
observed on diffuse reﬂection spectra. Spectra displaced vertically. The scale of absorbance values are for sample SA-11-22B only. Baselines for the absorption measurements
are shown by broken lines.

In order to obtain semi-quantitative information about the
anatase content, six samples were analysed using XRD. Diffraction data shows quartz to be the major phase of the samples
with up to 98%. Anatase was detected with up to 2%. XRD cannot

be used for semi-quantitative determinations of phyllosilicates
with an unknown orientation. However, it conﬁrms one of the
observed clay minerals in the analysed samples to be illite. An
additional minor amount of K-feldspar (microcline) can also be

detected but does not account for more than one percent of the
samples. The powder diffractograms do not show any moganite
peaks. These results are summarised in Table 1.
4.2. Temperature induced transformations in silcrete
4.2.1. SiOH and H2O before heat treatment
Despite relatively large error bars caused by the overall weak
concentrations of silanole and molecular water in the silcrete
samples, the assessment of the NIR combination bands’ absorptions shows coherent results. Fig. 4 shows spectra of 4 samples in
the frequency range of the analysed NIR combination bands. The
ﬁgure also allows for a comparison between high-resolution
diffuse reﬂection spectra and quantitative transmission spectra
used for ‘water’ content measurement. As can be expected,
quantitative transmission spectra yield less detail than diffuse
reﬂection spectra and the determined absorption values may yield
errors in the magnitude of the error bars in Figs. 5e7. Concentrations of H2Ostructure, SiOH and H2Oporosity before heat treatment
are summarised in Table 2. It can be noticed that the H2Ostructure
content is relatively low in all samples. The structural water
concentrations of the samples are 25e70 times lower than the
values known for length-fast chalcedony and ﬂint (Schmidt
et al., 2011, 2012b; Flörke et al., 1982; Graetsch et al., 1985).
Concerning the SiOH contents, the samples can be separated into
two groups. Samples SA-11-22B and SA-11-36 show silanole
contents comparable to those of ﬂint (Schmidt et al., 2011)
whereas the rest of the samples show SiOH contents between 2
and 6 times lower than those of ﬂint. Both samples with high SiOH
content show up to 4 times higher values of H2Oporosity than ﬂint
(Schmidt et al., 2011, 2012b). The 9 other samples show values of
water absorbing open porosity comparable with ﬂint or slightly
lower. These values indicate a signiﬁcantly higher open porosity/
silanole ratio for all silcrete samples than known from ﬂint and
chert. The silanole concentration shows no correlation with the
petrographic texture type. However, a correlation between silanole concentration and grain size of the cement together with the
percentage of larger clasts is noticeable. Samples with ﬁner
grained cement and/or fewer clasts contain more SiOH than
samples with coarser grained cement and a higher density of
clasts.
4.2.2. Thermal behaviour
All samples lost silanole upon heat treatment. Fig. 5 shows two
plots illustrating this tendency, one of a sample with a low SiOH
concentration (Fig. 5a) and one of a sample with a silanole

concentration comparable to ﬂint (Fig. 5b). Silanole is lost at
temperatures higher than 200e300  C. The processes governing
silanole loss seem therefore to be the same as in LF-chalcedony and
ﬂint (Schmidt et al., 2011, 2012b). Some silanole is retained until
600  C.
H2Ostructure concentrations are too low in the samples for
determining any evolution. Fig. 6 shows the error bars to be too
large for the evaluation of any tendency in the structural water
contents of the silcrete samples.
The H2Oporosity measurements show the heat induced reduction
of water absorbing open pores. Fig. 7 shows two plots of the pore
water concentration as a function of different annealing temperatures for two samples, one with an initial pore volume comparable
to ﬂint (Fig. 7a) and one with a 4 higher initial pore volume
(Fig. 7b). In the two samples with high silanole content, a ﬁrst loss
can be observed below 200  C. This ﬁrst loss at low temperatures
does not correspond to a true loss of porosity. It can be explained by
the progressive dehydration of a very ﬁne part of the porosity
between 100  C and 200  C that cannot easily be rehydrated
(Schmidt, 2011). This loss is not observed in samples with lower
silanole content. The loss of porosity becomes evident at temperatures higher than 400  C in all silcrete samples. Only a faint loss of
porosity can be noticed at lower temperatures. The total lost
volume, even at high temperatures, is small if compared to ﬂint
(Schmidt et al., 2011, 2012b). In order to obtain a porosity reduction
between 60% and 80%, the heating temperature has to attain at
least 500  C in all samples. Unlike pure LF-chalcedony, none of the
silcrete samples was completely devoid of open porosity after heat
treatment to 600  C.
TG curves of samples SA-11-12A and SA-11-36 and their derivatives are shown in Fig. 8. The curves show a total weight loss of
z0.22% and z0.6% respectively which is consistent with the
sample’s silanole concentration as determined by the NIR
measurements. Mass is continuously lost throughout the studied
temperature range. However, the curves of both samples show an
intermediary temperature range between 400  C and 550  C where
almost no mass is lost. NIR data indicates that the porosity loss in
both samples is strongest in this temperature range (Fig. 7). The
direct comparison between the TG curve’s derivatives and the NIR
open porosity values shows a good correlation between pore loss
and the intermediate temperature range where almost no mass is
lost (grey area in Fig. 8c and d). This strongly indicates that the
closure of open pores in the analysed silcrete samples is mainly due
to factors that do not involve the departure of mass (i.e. unlike ﬂint,
silanole loss is not the sole cause of the silcrete’s structural transformations upon heat treatment).

silanole content (for explanations see text). Spectra acquired in the dehydrated state. The values are obtained by measuring the absorbance of the SiOH 4547 cm1 combination

low and the calculated errors are too large for a clear evolution to be noticed from these measurements.

4.2.3. Maximum tolerated heating speed
Upon placing the silcrete samples in a furnace preheated to
550  C, only one of the seven samples showed traces of overheating
(Table 3). SA-11-36 showed several fractures and was judged
useless for tool production after this treatment. The other six
samples, however, did not show any heat induced fracturing,
crazing or other form of deterioration. It was possible to detach
a clean ﬂake from all of them. Even though SA-11-22B and SA-11-36
both have silanole contents comparable to ﬂint, only sample SA-1136 (the one with the highest SiOH content of all samples) showed
a deterioration of its ﬂaking quality after being subjected to this
abrupt treatment. The other samples showed lower SiOH concentrations (compare with Table 2). This result suggests a good
correlation between endured maximum heating speed, silanole
content and porosity of the samples.
5. Discussion
The sample’s mineralogical compositions and petrographic
textures correspond to a variety of other types of silcrete from
different parts of the world (Summerﬁeld, 1983) and the obtained
results on the studied samples’ thermal transformations can most
likely be transferred to a large number of silcrete from different
origins. This is currently being veriﬁed for silcrete from different
parts of South Africa.
The low SiOH and H2Ostructure contents and the high relative
porosity volume as compared with LF-chalcedony and ﬂint seem
to be the main heat treatment relevant difference between South

African continental silcrete and marine sedimentary silica rocks
(Schmidt et al., 2012b). These low ‘water’ contents can be
explained by the different nature of the microcrystalline cement of
both rocks. The analysed silcrete samples did not contain chalcedony but were made up of quartz clasts surrounded by a cement
of micro-quartz. The relative abundance of macro-quartz clasts,
devoid of hydroxyl defects, may also account for the low overall
water content of the rocks. The sample’s silanole concentration
seems to be directly correlated to the size of the micro-quartz
grains of the cement and the abundance of clasts. High SiOH
samples display a ﬁne micro-quartz cement whereas low SiOH
samples show a somewhat ‘coarser grained’ cement. The relatively
large pore volume of South African silcrete may be caused by voids
and channels due to illuviation in the original sediment (Porraz
et al., 2013) but also to pores and joints around clasts and structural elements in the rocks.
Our results show that the controlled treatment of IR transmission data (numerical smoothing) in combination with high
resolution diffuse reﬂection spectroscopy for data treatment
control is a good method for quantitative H2O and SiOH determinations in highly opaque sample. However, the results also show
the limitations of NIR water determinations in silcrete by means of
transmission. The structural water (H2Ostructure) contents are too
low in the z500 mm thick sections for signiﬁcant concentration
values to be calculated. These low concentrations could be
compensated for by thicker sections but the high opacity of the
material does not allow spectral acquisition with longer optical
pathways. This illustrates the need for further and more precise

content (for explanations see text). The values are obtained by subtracting the value of the H2O 5220 cm1 combination band in the dehydrated state from the band’s value in the
hydrated state. The disappearance of open pores becomes evident from 450  C upward.

studies for investigating all the parameters and key temperatures of
the silcrete’s thermal transformations. However, our results show
the major episodes and key temperatures of the heat induced
transformations in silcrete:
(1) The ﬁrst reaction of the material is the loss of silanole,
starting at temperatures between 200  C and 300  C. This is analogous to ﬂint and other LF-chalcedony rich silica rocks. However,
unlike ﬂint, the majority of the molecular water created by this
SiOH / H2O synthesis can be evacuated from the rock through
a relatively large network of open pores. This reaction must be
expected to contribute to the closing of a part of these pores but the
volume of open pores remains high at these temperatures as
compared to pure LF-chalcedony. The good evacuation of the
produced H2O prevents fracturing of the silcrete even at rapid
heating speeds. This loss of silanole and the closing of pores can be
expected to cause the ﬁrst transformation of the ﬂaking properties
between 200  C and 400  C.
(2) Annealing temperatures have to attain 400  Ce500  C for
the volume of water absorbing pores to be reduced by 60%e80%.
This loss of porosity does not correspond to the formation of
new bridging SieOeSi bonds for it is not associated with
a weight loss. It has to be explained by secondary constituents of
the rocks accomplishing a transformation that results in the loss
of porosity. A candidate for this pore closing reaction is the
swelling of the anatase fraction in the rocks. Indeed, Wang et al.
(2008) show a size increase of up to 20% for pure anatase particles subjected to a 500  C heat treatment. The volume increase of
the 1e2% anatase, ﬁnely distributed all over the cement of the
rocks, may contribute to the loss of their pore volume. Since pore
closing plays an important role in modifying the ﬂaking properties
of silica rocks (Schmidt et al., 2012b) and the strongest loss of
porosity can be ascribed to this reaction, the ideal temperature for
heat treatment of South African silcrete can be estimated to be
between 400  C and 500  C.

Even at heating temperatures as high as 600  C, water created
by the ‘liberation’ of silanole (Schmidt et al., 2011) can be evacuated
though a network of open pores that remains present in the rock. In
pure LF-chalcedony and ﬂint, it is the synthesis of H2O within the
rock, unable to be evacuated by open pores, that causes fracturing
of the samples (Schmidt et al., 2012b). Differential thermal
expansion of the quartz crystallites is unlikely to cause fracturing in
micro-crystalline silica rocks at temperatures below 600  C. Both
the linear and volumetric thermal expansion coefﬁcients of aquartz are relatively low as compared to other natural materials
(Sosman, 1927). The fact that none of our large silcrete samples
with low SiOH content suffered fracturing, crazing or any other
deterioration upon abrupt exposure to 550  C corroborates the
ﬁnding of Schmidt et al. (2012b) and Schmidt (2011) that the
driving force of overheating in micro-crystalline silica rocks is not
differential thermal expansion but increasing vapour pressure of
ﬂuid inclusions in the rocks. Even the largest volume tested did not
show signs of overheating upon abrupt exposure to heat; indicating
that heat induced fracturing of low-SiOH-silcrete is independent of
volume in the range of the tested temperatures (until 550  C) and
volumes (until 79 cm3). This corroborates the results of Mercieca
and Hiscock (2008) who showed that silcrete can be rapidly
heated until 600  C.
Thus, regardless of whether MSA hunter-gatherers beneﬁtted
from the formation of new SieOeSi bonds or the loss of porosity
caused by secondary minerals, the heating speed could be
dramatically faster than for ﬂint and the maximum temperature
did not need to be controlled as carefully as for ﬂint. However,
whereas low-SiOH-silcrete is very tolerant to heating speed and
temperature, heat treatment of larger blocks of high-SiOH-silcrete
might require slightly more attention.
The role of the <1% clay fraction in the samples remains to be
investigated. If the dehydration of clay (illite and kaolinite) plays
a role in the modiﬁcation process of the mechanical properties of

P. Schmidt et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 40 (2013) 3519e3531

South African silcrete, the temperatures at which this reaction
begins to be effective lie above 500  C. Furthermore, some of the
observed transformations (i.e. the role of strongly retained water
and the implications of the relatively voluminous network of
porosity to the rock’s ﬂaking properties) still remain to be understood using a set of appropriate analyses. A complete research
program on South African silcrete and its role in the emergence of
heat treatment for tool production is currently being prepared.
6. Implications for the emergence of heat treatment in the
South African MSA
These results have important implications for understanding
the discovery and mastering of lithic heat treatment in the South
African MSA. The identiﬁcation of heat treatment in the MSA
(Brown et al., 2009) has pushed the earliest occurrence of this
practice several thousand years back from previous reports from
the European Upper Palaeolithic (Tiffagom, 1998; Bordes, 1969). At
present, these South African MSA hunter-gatherers seem to have
been the ﬁrst humans to intentionally modify lithic raw material for
knapping.
There seems to be general agreement in the current literature
that heat treatment is a sophisticated technology requiring
advanced cognitive capacities and a complex socio-economic
structure. Alongside blade production, geometric backed tools
and pressure ﬂaking, heat treatment may therefore be understood
as a behavioural proxy marking a main step in the technological
evolution of prehistoric societies. This seems to hold true for heat
treatment of ﬂint as it is known from the European Upper Palaeolithic and the Neolithic. Indeed, ﬂint heat treatment is a rather
complicated procedure. The maximal heating temperature and the
ramp rate are functions of the volume of the rocks (Schmidt et al.,
2012b) and larger volumes are rather complicated to heat-treat
because water is not easily evacuated from the interior (Schmidt
et al., in press; Léa, 2004). In order to succeed in the treatment,
an environment that prevents the material from heating too rapidly
and exceeding temperatures must be established and maintained
(Crabtree and Butler, 1964; Schmidt et al., 2012b). This heating
environment requires the makers to have an intimate knowledge of
[1] the heated material’s properties and its temperature induced
modiﬁcations and [2] the control of ﬁre and its thermal gradients in
the material used for the heating environment (e.g. sand in the case
of a sand bath).
However, heat treatment in the South African MSA was not
performed for transforming ﬂint but silcrete. In this preliminary
study, we found major differences between the thermal properties
of these two rocks. Silcrete needs to be heated to temperatures
approximately 200  C higher than ﬂint and the temperatures at
which silcrete experiences overheating (cracking, crazing, deterioration of its ﬂaking quality) are signiﬁcantly higher than for ﬂint
(Schmidt et al., 2012b). Heating rates for silcrete with low ‘water’
content can also be considerably faster. Thus, most South African
silcrete demands a much less elaborate heating procedure. Due to
these relatively high effective temperatures and the large temperature range that silcrete can endure, it seems likely that this early
heat treatment involved the use of areas surrounding open ﬁres or
the use of slightly cooled embers that were isolated from an open
ﬁre (with an average temperature of 550  C). This is especially true
for silcrete with low ‘water’ contents as it was the case for most of
our samples. The heating characteristics of this silcrete do not
require the setup of a special heating environment, nor do they
demand any more knowledge or investment than the heating of
compound adhesives, as known from the South African MSA
archaeological record (Wadley et al., 2009), or the use of ﬁre for
cooking. The experimental reproduction of heat treatment by

3529

Brown et al. (2009), using a protocol based on very slow indirect
heating of the samples to 350  C in a sand bath beneath a wood ﬁre
designed for this purpose, seems to be an over investment. Silcrete
heat treatment may therefore not correspond to a particularly high
investment, neither in time nor in resources, as proposed by these
authors but it could have been a relatively rapid and easy step in the
chaîne opératoire of the lithic production. However, a very small
part of our samples (two) showed higher ‘water’ content that the
rest. These speciﬁc types of silcrete may have required slightly
more careful handling during heat treatment. Even though only the
assessment of the ‘water’ content of the silcrete types actually used
for heat treatment during the MSA will shed light on the question of
the used procedures, we remind that high-SiOH-silcrete only
represents a very small part of the silcrete types found in the West
Coast area.
We therefore strongly disagree with the hypothesis that silcrete
raw material became more abundant during the MSA because of
the temporal abundance of ﬁrewood allowing supplementary ﬁres
required for the heat treatment of the silcrete (Brown and Marean,
2010). Our results indicate that silcrete does not require the setup of
supplementary ﬁres but that it can easily be performed on ﬁres
used for cooking, heating and other ﬁre-related activities. Hence, it
does not automatically represent a supplementary cost in terms of
time or wood consumption. Moreover, no dramatic change in wood
consumption can be seen in the Diepkloof archaeological record
(Cartwright, 2013) whereas heated silcrete was found throughout
the sequence. We believe that one driving factor alone cannot
account for the variation of raw material provisioning strategies
observed during the MSA.
We also showed that heat treatment of silcrete does not
necessarily require a sophisticated knowledge of ﬁre and the
heated material. Even though the ﬁrst heating evidence at Diepkloof coincides with an increase of silcrete raw material (Porraz
et al., 2013), local quartzite was also heated (Tribolo et al., 2013).
However, due to the absence of a surface gloss on the fracture
negatives of heated quartzite artefacts, it is difﬁcult to determine
whether quartzite heat treatment took place before knapping or if
the quartzite was simply burned after use. If it could be demonstrated that quartzite was also heated before knapping, this may
suggest a somewhat opportunistic practise of heat treatment,
hence that it did not hinge on the intimate knowledge of the rawmaterial and its transformations. This is because heat treatment of
most types of quartzite is useless, for this metamorphic rock
already lost all its silanole (if there had ever been some) by the
inﬂuence of heat and pressure, hence no transformation of the
material can be achieved like in chalcedony, ﬂint and silcrete
(Schmidt et al., 2011, 2012b). However, this hypothesis needs
further investigation and discussion.
The current archaeological data shows that the importance of
heat treatment varied throughout time. Heat treatment of silcrete
represents an indisputable advantage for lithic production on silcrete and MSA people may have deliberately manipulated this
physical transformation. Nonetheless, the question of intentionality, invention and mastering of heat treatment needs to be discussed with reference to speciﬁc technological contexts. The
hypothesis that the mastering of heat treatment is at the origin of
advanced technology during the MSA seems unlikely in the light of
our results and requires further investigation.
The model suggested by our preliminary study needs to be
corroborated by further analyses of the properties and transformation of archaeological silcrete, such as the exact determination of the temperatures used for the treated artefacts, their
petrography and their silanole content. The volume of heat-treated
silcrete blocks larger than 80 cm3 can also be expected to inﬂuence
on the heating procedure and must be taken into account together

3530

with their physical and chemical properties (Work currently in
progress for the MSA sequence of Diepkloof). This ﬁrst study shows
nonetheless that a direct comparison between heat treatment in
the MSA and more recent examples of the systematic transformations of raw material (dating from the European Upper
Palaeolithic) is not as straightforward as it might appear at ﬁrst
glance.
