This paper presents the first TL dates for burnt quartzites and silcretes from the Still Bay
layers of Blombos Cave (South Africa). These layers contained engraved ochres and marine
shell beads that could be an early manifestation of symbolic and thus ‘modern’ behaviour
by the Middle Stone Age humans. The procedure devised to calculate the ages is presented
in detail, particularly with regard to internal microdosimetry, because the problems faced
in estimating the dose rates require an approach different from the one usually used on flints
and sediments. A mean age of 74 ± 5 ka was obtained for five burnt lithics unearthed in
the BBC M1 member of the Still Bay layers. This result is in good agreement with both ESR
dates on teeth and OSL dates on sediment, and demonstrates the great antiquity of the
archaeological remains discovered at Blombos Cave.

INTRODUCTION

Very few Middle Stone Age (MSA, ≈ 250–40 ka) sites have been found with Still Bay artefacts,
whose distinguishing feature is a very finely shaped bifacial foliate point. This techno-complex
of the South African MSA is poorly known. The excavations at Blombos Cave (34°25′S,
21°13′E, southern coast, 300 km east of Cape Town—Fig. 1) by C. Henshilwood and coworkers in 1992 and after 1997, have propelled the Still Bay techno-complex into the
limelight after the discovery of more than 400 bifacial foliate points, more than 30 bone tools,
and several large fish bones, engraved ochres and marine shell beads (Henshilwood and Sealy
1997; Henshilwood et al. 2001a,b, 2002, 2004; d’Errico et al. 2005). Bone points and large
fish bones are extremely rare in MSA sites, marine shell beads are previously unrecorded and
although ochres are not uncommon, no engraved pieces have previously been reported for this
period: engraved ochres are more common in Upper Palaeolithic and Later Stone Age (LSA)

sand dune (‘hiatus’), dated by OSL to c. 70 ka (Jacobs 2003a,b), which underlies the recent (<2 ka) LSA layers

sites and have been linked with modern behaviour (e.g., McBrearty and Brooks 2000). Thus,
the age of the Blombos Cave MSA layers, for which the 14C method suggests an age greater
than 40 ka (Henshilwood et al. 2002) and the OSL and preliminary TL dates of sediments
indicate an age in excess of 70 ka (Vogel et al. 1999; Jacobs et al. 2003a,b; Jacobs 2004;
Henshilwood pers. comm.), acquires key importance in refining the MSA chronology and
establishing the antiquity of modern human behaviour. This paper presents thermoluminescence
(TL) dates of burnt lithic artefacts found in the upper part of the MSA complex.
SITE STRATIGRAPHY AND SAMPLES

Blombos Cave is a 50 m2 wave-cut cavity in the calcrete cliff and is now 35 m above sea level.
The LSA layers, which are less than 2000 years old, are underlain by a 5–60 cm thick sterile
sand dune that caps the MSA layers (Fig. 1). The latter, labelled from CA to CJ, are finely
bedded or laminated and composed of brown sands, ashes and shells. Organic materials, such
as bone and shell, are very well preserved throughout the stratigraphy and some layers have
been affected by subsidence. In the lower part of the MSA sequence, this subsidence distorted
the layers around large blocks of calcarenite dispersed on the basal bedrock.

The stratigraphic sequence has been divided into three main phases: at the top, BBC M1
(layers CA to CE), in which most Still Bay points were found, more than 40 marine shell beads
and two fragments of engraved ochre; in the middle, BBC M2 (layers CFA to CGA), which
yielded most of the bone points; and at the bottom, BBC M3 (layers CGB to CJ and beyond),
containing high densities of shellfish remains and ochre fragments (Henshilwood et al. 2002).
Seven lithic artefacts found in the proximity of ash and charcoals were selected for TL
dating as they appeared to have been heated: two were of quartzite (BB1 and BB23) and five
of silcrete (BB6, BB12, BB15, BB20 and BB24). These samples weighed from 5.6 to 150 g
and came mainly from the BBC M1 phase, except for BB1 and BB6, which came from BBC
M2 phase (Fig. 1).
METHODOLOGY

The heating of a siliceous stone in a hearth at a temperature of at least 400°C enables the
complete erasure of any accumulated time-dependent (luminescence) signal and this process
offers the possibility of using the stone as a geochronometer. Moreover, the natural radiation
dose recorded by the crystal lattice since the sample was last heated in a prehistoric hearth can
be evaluated by the thermoluminescence (TL) technique: the dose that induces a TL signal
equivalent to the natural signal is called the palaeodose or dose equivalent (De) and, when
divided by the average dose rate (Dr) experienced by the sample during burial, gives its ‘age’
(i.e., the time elapsed since the last heating event):
age = De/Dr.
The dose received by a sample comes from the alpha and beta particles and gamma rays emitted
by the natural radioisotopes of the U and Th series as well as 40K. Cosmic rays also contribute
to the total dose, but to a lesser extent. As these radiations have very different ranges in siliceous
materials (typically 20 µm, 2 mm and 30 cm for α, β and γ, respectively), the total dose rate
can be divided into an internal component, due mainly to α and β originating in the sample
itself, and an external component including cosmic rays and γ photons received from the
radioisotopes present in the surrounding sediment within a sphere of 30–40 cm radius.
Sample preparation
In order to simplify the microdosimetry, the external part (at least 2 mm thick) of each sample
irradiated by alpha and beta particles from the surrounding sediment was removed with a diamond saw. The remaining core, weighing between 1 and 4 g, was crushed in a Habisch mortar
until all grains passed through a 160 µm mesh. One part of this powder was kept for dosimetric
analyses; another was sieved and the 100–160 µm fraction selected for De measurements.
The internal dose rate
The internal dose rate depends on the concentration of radioisotopes, and because of the
relatively short range of α and β particles compared to the sample size, it also depends on their
distribution inside the artefact. These two factors were investigated separately.
The mean concentrations of radioisotopes (U, Th and K) were determined by delayed neutron activation (DNA) (Joron 1974) on homogenized 100 mg aliquots. For each sample, one
aliquot was analysed in a first batch (Table 1 (a)). U and Th values are highly variable, ranging

measurements. Note that the mean U and Th contents of these parts differ slightly from those measured on the core,
indicating that the distribution of radioisotopes is not uniform on the scale of a few centimetres. This observation
shows that it is essential to measure the radioisotope contents and De on the same part of each sample

more than 10 times higher in the quartzites (BB23, 1017 ppm; BB1, 1955 ppm) than in silcretes
(from 61 to 95 ppm), except for BB15, which gave an intermediate value (507 ppm). In order
to assess the representativeness of the 100 mg aliquots, another part of the largest samples
(quartzite BB1 and silcrete BB6) was crushed and split into ∼100 mg aliquots: this second
batch was analysed for U and Th. Thorium was also measured in the BB6 sample by using
smaller aliquots (from ∼6 to 21 mg). The scatter of these results (Table 1 (b)) is always smaller
for Th (10% for BB1, 3% for BB6 for 100 mg or smaller aliquots) than for U (21% for BB1
and 6% for BB6). However, an examination of the U values of sample BB1 reveals that this

of quartz grains—the main component. Coloured (heavy) minerals are rare and not easily seen on pictures. (a) BB24
(silcrete); natural light: variable-size quartz grains are set among a cryptocrystalline phase (shown in black on
low-magnification pictures)—BB6, BB12 and BB20 look like BB24. (b) BB15 (silcrete); natural light: this sample is
characterized by quartz grains that are more homogeneous in size (diameter 250 µm) and by the absence of a fine
matrix. (c) BB1 (quartzite); crossed-polarized light: two ranges of grain size are mixed (>200 µm and 20 µm) and
the grains are set along cleavage planes, which are underlined by small fissures—BB23 is very similar to BB1.

high relative standard deviation (21%) is mainly due to aliquots whose concentrations differ
significantly from the mean (at more than two sigma) and which might contain a higher proportion of grains rich in uranium. However, as only two of over 12 aliquots are concerned, we
assumed that the U, Th and K contents determined with 100 mg aliquots were representative
of the fragments analysed and we used these concentrations in the dose-rate calculations.
Observation of thin sections yielded indirect information on the distribution of radioisotopes: as quartz grains are the main constituents of quartzite and silcrete lithics, it is likely
that the radioisotopes are located between the grains (or as ‘grain coatings’) where ferruginous
oxides are found and/or concentrated in certain mineral impurities (Fig. 2). At the grain scale,
radioisotopes are then probably not uniformly distributed. These observations also indicated
that grain-size distributions were highly variable and differed from sample to sample.
The distribution of uranium was investigated by the fission track mapping (FTM) technique
(Price and Walker 1963; Kleeman and Lovering 1967). One silcrete (BB6), and two quartzites
(BB1 and BB23) were examined. In this method, the fission tracks of 235U induced by neutron

covered with a plastic (kapton; Sélo 1983) and irradiated in the nuclear reactor ‘Orphée’, canal P1 (CEA-Saclay),
simultaneously with SRM standards (50 and 1 ppm) from the National Bureau of Standards (Washington). Two
integrated fluxes of 1.35 × 1015 and 2.67 × 1016 neutrons were used to allow for the counting of tracks of weak and
strong concentrations, respectively (only the kaptons were changed between the irradiations). The tracks made visible
by an exposure to a solution of 14% NaClO + 12% NaCl, for 8 min at 100°C, and counted with an optical microscope
under ×100 magnification. (a) BB1: the uranium is concentrated in ‘hot spots’. (b) BB6: the uranium is concentrated

irradiation are recorded using an external detector, fixed on the sample during irradiation. In
all cases, as expected, quartz grains were found to be free of uranium. In BB1, almost 63% of the
uranium is scattered along the surface in ‘hot spots’ (50–200 µm in diameter) of variable U
concentrations (from 14 to 600 ppm), and sometimes along fissures (Fig. 3 (a)). The same could
be observed for BB23, although the spots are less numerous and exhibit higher concentrations.
For the silcrete BB6, the uranium is mostly present around the biggest quartz inclusions—that
is, in the ‘fine matrix’ visible on thin sections—although one also finds small hot spots and
locally high concentrations in fissures (Fig. 3 (b)). The level of heterogeneity of the uranium
distribution appears, then, to be dependent upon the samples, but it is important to note that
these heterogeneities have only a limited influence upon the beta dose rate inside the grains
because of the relatively long range of this type of radiation in silica (∼2 mm), and they concern mainly the alpha particles, whose range is much smaller (∼20 µm).

Figure 4 A 100 –160 µm grain of BB1 prepared by crushing for the De measurements, observed with a scanning
electron microscope. It is actually a cluster of a ∼100 µm grain to several ∼20 µm ones.

As it is not possible to get a precise 3D distribution of all the radioisotopes, we calculated
the internal dose rate for each sample by applying a statistical model in which the emitters are
homogeneously distributed outside the quartz grains. According to thin-section and FTM
observations, it is clear that such a model is more appropriate for BB6 (and samples BB12,
BB20 and BB24) than for BB1 and BB23 (and BB15). In this model, for a given size of quartz
grain (i), the internal dose rate for a radiation (α or β) and a radioisotope (U, Th or K) is as
follows:
Dr = ZCdsai,
where Z is the efficiency factor (1 for beta, S-alpha for alpha radiation; see Appendix 1), C is
the concentration of the radioisotope, ds is the specific dose rate (Adamiec and Aitken 1998)
or flux (deduced from Brennan and Lyons 1989) and ai is the attenuation factor for the range
size i (Mejdahl 1979; Brennan et al. 1991).
Thus, grains of different size received different doses and so do not contribute to the same
extent to the natural TL. These contributions need to be evaluated separately. Furthermore, it was
assumed that the grains used for TL measurements were representative of the natural sample
(i.e., all grain-size fractions are present in their relative proportions). This hypothesis was tested
by looking at the 100–160 µm fraction selected for De measurements with a scanning electron
microscope (Fig. 4): this fraction contains a mixture of ‘natural’ grains split by crushing during
preparation and ‘artificial’ grains made partly of large grains and clusters of small ‘real’ grains.
The internal dose rate for a type of radiation (α or β) is then as follows:

∑ZCds ai fi ,
i

where fi is the fraction of volume occupied by the grain of size i. In order to evaluate this
parameter for each sample, ‘fi’ diagrams were built from numerical pictures of thin sections by

C. Tribolo et al.

Figure 5 The fi parameter (the percentage of the volume occupied by each size range). The diagrams were
constructed either ‘manually’ or using the image-analysis software Scion-Image1 (Francus 1998). In the first case,
small and large axes were defined for each grain, the mean value was used as a diameter and the surface was
deduced; in the second case, the area was directly measured by the software (it was verified that both methods led to
the same results). In white, BB15: the grain sizes were measured ‘manually’, since the picture quality prevented the
software from properly distinguishing the grains. In black, BB20: the size measurements for the >25 µm grains were

assuming that the area frequency of a phase on a random section of a rock is proportional to
its volume frequency (Delesse 1847; cited by Clark 1982). Figure 5 gives an example of the
‘fi’ diagram for samples BB15 and BB20.
The internal dose rates calculated using this model range from 11 ± 1 to 295 ± 10 µGy a−1
for alpha radiation and from 122 ± 8 to 559 ± 22 µGy a−1 for beta radiation.
The external dose rate
As already mentioned, the sedimentological sequence of the MSA layers seems strongly
heterogeneous: scattered amidst clearly distinguishable sands, shell middens and ash layers, are
huge blocks of calcarenite. Consequently, spatial variations in the dose rate are to be expected.
In order to get information about the spatial heterogeneity of the dose rate, 24 SO4Ca:Dy
dosimeters were left in the different layers for a period of nearly 1 year (Fig. 6). They were
inserted 30 cm into accessible sections, in close proximity to the lithic sample find spots. Field
gamma spectrometer measurements were also performed in a hole in the calcarenite wall and
in the dune layer.
The gamma dose rates, which are displayed in Figure 6 and in Table 3 below, were calculated from the doses recorded by the dosimeters, assuming a cosmic ray contribution of
45 µGy a−1 (Jacobs et al. 2003b). For the upper dune, the deduced values range from 321 to
394 µGy a−1 and are similar to the gamma dose rate measured with the field gamma spectrometer

where they range from 400 to 557 µGy a−1. It is worth noting, however, that no clear horizontal
or vertical trend of radioactivity change is observed. Moreover, the gamma dose rates measured
in the calcarenite wall (409 ± 61 µGy a−1) do not differ significantly from those recorded in

the sediments, and one can conclude that the calcarenite blocks present in the MSA layers do
not introduce any strong radioactive heterogeneity.
While the spatial heterogeneity of the dose rate is less dramatic than expected, a second
problem to be addressed concerns possible temporal variations. Indeed, this could be induced by
the subsidence phenomenon observable at the bottom of the sequence, as well as through past
variations of water content, which potentially affects the state of equilibrium of the uranium
decay chain. Therefore, it is possible that the present-day dose rate is not representative of the
past mean dose rate. To get information concerning the eventual disequilibrium in the decay
chain, sediment samples (taken in close vicinity to each lithic sample), as well as blocks of
calcarenite, were analysed by gamma spectrometry in the laboratory (Tables 2 (a) and 2 (b)).
The measured 234Th/226Ra ratio revealed that the uranium series is not in secular equilibrium, and
alpha spectrometric measurements carried out on one sample indicated that this disequilibrium
is due to radium loss. In evaluating the gamma dose rate to which the burnt lithics were
subjected in the past, we took this observation into account. However, it is important to note
that this particular disequilibrium, whose importance could have been different in the past, has
a minor impact on the calculated age. In fact, the U-series contributes to only 56 ± 6% of the
actual gamma dose rate, and since this fraction of the total dose rate is 54 ± 12%, even a
change as high as 50% of the uranium contribution would lead to a final age error of no more than
15%. Moreover, the 226Ra and 210Pb activities are quite similar, and since these radioisotopes

contribute mainly to the gamma dose rate, it is likely that the value of this parameter did not
change significantly, at least recently. Furthermore, without more information, we assumed that
the present moisture content (already taken into account by the dosimeters) was representative
of the past mean water content of the sediments.
Equivalent dose (Ed) determinations
The 100–160 µm fraction was used for the De determinations after it was washed with aqueous
hydrochloric acid (3N), distilled water, ethanol and acetone. The TL measurements were carried
out using a home-made automatic apparatus (Valladas et al. 1994) that uses large plates containing 10 mg of sample powder. The detection of the TL signal was performed with a Thorn EMI
9635QB photomultiplier tube and a 3 mm thick MTO 385 optical filter (maximum transmission
∼380 nm). A 137Cs gamma source delivering 78.4 Gy h−1 was used for artificial irradiations.
The samples exhibited variable TL glow curves (Fig. 7): the signals displayed either a large
composite peak at 360°C (BB23) or 340°C (BB6), or a single peak at 375°C (BB24), or both
325 and 400°C TL peaks. Moreover, all of the artificially irradiated samples showed a 240°C
TL peak, which was eliminated by a preheat before measurement.
To determine the De, an additive dose technique was used (Aitken 1985) and regenerative
curves were built by irradiating a part of the powder after its natural TL signal had been erased
by a low thermal treatment at 300 or 320°C for 8 h (Tribolo 2003) in order to minimize
any thermal effect leading to changes in the shape of the TL curves (Michab et al. 1998).
This approach was suitable for most of the samples, except for BB23. In this particular case,
the De was estimated by extrapolation along the x-axis of the additive growth curve and the

Table 3 Radiometric and associated values used for TL age calculations. For each sample, its nature—silcrete (S) or quartzite (Q)—determined by thin-section observations is indicated. Beta and alpha dose rates were calculated from the U, Th and K contents given in Table 2, with a 10% associated error on each radioisotope, and assuming a uniform distribution of radioisotopes outside the quartz grains. The alpha dose rate also takes into account the alpha efficiency (S-alpha given in µGy a−1 for 103
alpha per cm2) of each sample (Valladas and Valladas 1982). Gamma dose rates (internal and external) were calculated by taking into account the attenuation expected
for each sample according to its weight and shape (Valladas 1985). The total dose rate includes a 45 µGy a−1 cosmic contribution. The De’s are the unweighted averages
(except for BB1, BB23 and BB6) of the values obtained with the additive dose (A) and slide (S) methods (n.d. = not determined)

TL dating of burnt lithics from Blombos Cave (South Africa)

Figure 8 A plot of the seven calculated TL ages (circles) together with the ESR (triangles) and OSL (squares)
estimates (Jones 2001; Jacobs 2004; Jacobs et al. submitted). All TL ages were calculated assuming a model in which
the uranium is uniformly distributed in the siliceous matrix surrounding the quartz grains (filled circles). For the two
quartzites (BB23 and BB1) and the silcrete BB15, the ages were recalculated with a model in which the uranium is
concentrated in ‘hot spots’ separated by an average distance of 1000 µm (open circles). As noted in the text, this
model is diametrically opposed to the uniform distribution model and the true age of these samples might lie between
these two values.

regenerative curve was not used. For all of the other samples, the intercepts on the dose axis of
the extrapolated additive and regenerative growth curves were added. A slide technique was also
attempted for these samples: the additive curve was moved along the dose axis until it fitted
with the regenerative curve, in order to accommodate sensitivity changes (Mercier et al. 1992;
Sanzelle et al. 1996).
The De estimated using these two approaches are given in Table 3. For BB20 and BB24, the
results obtained by the two techniques are compatible within one standard deviation. For
BB12 and BB15, the agreement is only within two standard deviations and might be due to a
small (but tolerable) difference between the additive and regeneration curve shapes. For each
sample, the age was calculated by averaging the two De determinations, when such were available.
AGE CALCULATION AND DISCUSSION

The calculated ages are plotted in Figure 8 in stratigraphic order. For the BBC M1 member,
the ages are compatible at one standard deviation and the stratigraphic inversions in mean
estimates are not significant. For BBC M2, the ages are compatible only at two standard deviations. By looking at the data, one can see that the fine fraction (<15 µm) of the silcretes gave

354

C. Tribolo et al.

the oldest ages, whereas the two quartzites (BB23 and BB1) and the BB15 silcrete appeared
younger. An explanation for this scatter might be related to the uranium distribution inside the
samples. Indeed, the fission track maps indicate that a model assuming a uniform distribution
of radioisotope is better adapted to silcretes (except for BB15, which stands apart due to its K
content) than to quartzites in which the radioisotopes are concentrated among scattered hot spots.
For these last samples, a model in which the relevant parameter is the average distance between
hot spots would have been probably more suitable. It can thus be shown that if one had assumed,
for instance, a value of 1000 µm for this distance, the ages would have been greater, as expected,
since the uniform model leads to minimum ages. Thus one would have calculated 75 ± 7 ka
instead of 68 ± 6 ka for BB15, 74 ± 8 ka for BB23 (instead of 67 ± 7 ka) and 98 ± 10 ka for
BB1 (instead of 76 ± 8 ka). It is important to point out that such a distance can be seen as an
extreme, for it is greater than what was observed on fission track maps as well as on thin sections,
where minerals other than quartz are sometimes visible. One can safely conclude that the true
ages of these three samples are likely to be bounded by the limits listed above (see Fig. 8).
If we take into account all the ages calculated using the uniform model, a weighted mean
age of 74 ± 5 ka is obtained for the BBC M1 member. In the other extreme case, assuming a
1000 µm model for samples BB15 and BB23, the weighted mean age is 78 ± 6 ka. Therefore,
the most reliable time interval for member BBC M1 can be presumed to fall between 74 ± 5
and 78 ± 6 ka. This result can be compared with the ages obtained by other methods (Fig. 8).
Single and multiple grains OSL measurements on sediment gave consistent ages from 65.6 ± 2.8
to 70.9 ± 2.8 ka for three samples of the upper dune (Jacobs et al. 2003a) and 74.9 ± 3.8 ka
for one sample of BBC M1, layer CC (Jacobs 2004; Jacobs et al. submitted). Electron spin
resonance (ESR) dating on seven teeth from BBC M1 yielded a mean age of 80 ± 6 ka, assuming
a linear uptake model (but an age of only 62 ± 6 ka was obtained with an early uptake model;
Jones 2001). For BBC M2, the OSL method gives ages between 76.8 ± 3.0 and 84.6 ± 5.8 ka,
which are consistent with the TL age of BB1. Sample BB6 seems too old compared to these
estimates. This sample set apart, the fact that the three different dating methods yield concordant results supports the idea that the uranium series disequilibrium detected in the sediment is
not significant. If this had been the case, different ages would have been obtained, since the
dependence on the external dose rate is not the same for the different samples, such as teeth,
sediment and stones. The good agreement between the TL, OSL and ESR dates also confirms
that despite the approximate nature of the model used, the approach we used for determining
the internal dose rate of the burnt lithics can yield consistent results.
Thus the ages obtained at Blombos Cave firmly suggest that the Still Bay techno-complex
was in use during isotope stage 5a (Martinson et al. 1987), which is consistent with the palaeoenvironmental data from these layers, suggesting a temperate climate. Moreover, the sterile
dune that caps this complex corresponds to an increase of sand availability as the sea level
decreased, during the cooler stage 4. Thanks to the interdisciplinary research at Blombos
Cave, the Still Bay can now be chronologically correlated with other techno-complexes,
whereas, up to now, it was only known in a poor stratigraphic context at a handful of sites and
its place amongst other MSA features was uncertain. Henshilwood et al. (2001b) has suggested that since bifacial points are found below occurrences of Howieson’s Poort and not
above, the Still Bay is older than the Howieson’s Poort. The increasing number of dates
obtained by different methods suggests that the Howieson’s Poort can be assigned (at least in
the southern Cape) to between the end of stage 4 and the beginning of stage 3 (Tribolo 2003;
Tribolo et al. 2005), further supporting the hypothesis proposed by Henshilwood et al. However, it is accepted that the range of dated Still Bay occurrences requires expansion.

TL dating of burnt lithics from Blombos Cave (South Africa)

355

As stated in the introduction to this paper, another important point about the dating of the
Still Bay layers at Blombos Cave was the presence of items with possible symbolic meaning,
such as engraved ochres, marine shell beads and bone points. Since the integrity of the stratigraphy has already been demonstrated (Henshilwood et al. 2001a, 2002, 2005; Jacobs et al.
2005), the new data provide supplementary evidence for the early and possibly gradual
appearance of ‘modern’ (at least ‘symbolic’) behaviour amongst anatomically modern humans
in Africa, as opposed to the ‘revolution hypothesis’, which claims that modern behaviour first
appeared in Europe at the onset of the Upper Palaeolithic (e.g., McBrearty and Brooks 2000).
CONCLUSIONS

The TL dating method enables us to propose the time interval between 74 ± 5 and 78 ± 6 ka
as being the most reliable age for the upper part of the MSA layers at Blombos Cave (Phase
M1), where Still Bay bifacial points, marine shell beads, two fragments of engraved ochre and
bone points have been discovered. This result is in agreement with ages obtained by other
radiometric methods (Jones 2001; Jacobs et al. 2003a,b) and supports the idea that the Still
Bay techno-complex is slightly older than the Howieson’s Poort. The consistency of our
results also indicates that the difficulties encountered in calculating the internal dose rate of
the burnt lithics dated by TL (silcrete and quartzite) can be overcome in part. However, further
improvements are necessary to increase the precision of the age determinations.

APPENDIX

The calculation of S-alpha
The S-alpha value (Valladas and Valladas 1982) is determined by comparing the luminescence
signals obtained after irradiations with a beta source (calibrated in Gy s−1) and an alpha source
(delivering a known flux of alpha particles; i.e., a number per second and square centimetre):
S-alpha =

Lα × Dβ
,
Lβ × Fα

where Lα and Lβ are the luminescence signals induced, respectively, by the alpha (Fα) and
beta (Dβ) irradiations.
Note that the S-alpha value is supposed to depend on the nature of quartz and not on the
grain-size fraction.
