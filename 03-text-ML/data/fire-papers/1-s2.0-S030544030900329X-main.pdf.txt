Recently, rice ﬁelds dated between 5000 and 2500 BC were found at the Tianluoshan sit in east China.
The early rice ﬁelds dated between 5000 and 4500 BC are the oldest rice ﬁelds known. The discovery has
provided data of recovering reclamation, cultivation, and the ecological system of rice ﬁelds in the
Neolithic age. People opened up marshes of dense reeds with ﬁre and wooden or bone spades, in order to
create rice ﬁelds. In the rice ﬁelds, there was not only rice, but a lot of weeds as well. The excavations
proved that little or even no weeding or irrigation was adopted. However, tilling soil by wooden and
bone tools was evidenced. The average yields are estimated to have been about 830 kg for the early
period and 950 kg per hectare for the later period. The cultivation system was low-level. Although the
Tianluoshan people cultivated rice, they still obtained a great deal of food by gathering and hunting.

1. Introduction
In the Early Holocene epoch, the prologue of cultivation and
domestication of rice in China was opened in two core areas, the
middle Yangtze basin and the Yangtze delta (Higham and Lu, 1998).
In the Yangtze delta, an over 8000-year–old process of cultivation
and domestication of rice and a long history of utilization of rice has
been demonstrated by morphological research of the short rachillae (spikelet bases) and spikelets (Zheng et al., 2004, 2007). Recent
archaeological research indicates that the initial rice cultivation
within this area is even earlier, dating back to at least 10000 years
ago (Jiang and Liu, 2006; Zheng and Jiang, 2007), much earlier than
the appearance of fully domesticated rice (Fuller et al., 2006). This
area deserves attention as the birthplace of rice cultivation.
Rice cultivation is a human activity that exerts some selective
pressure on the growth and development of rice in speciﬁc areas in
order to obtain a more stable food supply than the gathering of wild
plants. It allows populations to rise or to become sedentary as well.
The activities include tilling soil, sowing, fertilizing, irrigating, etc.
To understand the origins of rice cultivation, not only archaeological remains of rice but also knowledge of culture and ecology in the
Neolithic age is important (Crawford and Shen, 1998). Excavations

and research on archaeological sites of rice cultivation can provide
better insight into technique, area, yield and environment of rice
cultivation. Archaeological and archaeobotanical evidence can be
used for estimating the advances in both cultivation and morphological domestication, during the origins of rice agriculture.
In the Yangtze delta, small paddy ﬁelds with irrigating ditches
and wells of 6000 years ago have been found. They were initial
modiﬁcations of the natural topography (Fujiwara, 1998; Cao et al.,
2006). Older ones have not been found and excavated, although it
was inferred that rice paddies with ﬁre and ﬂood management had
appeared based on analyzing pollens, diatoms, and charcoal in the
occupation area of the Kuahuqiao site between 6000 and 5500 BC
(Zong et al., 2007). Recently our recovery of prehistoric rice ﬁelds
around the wooden pile-dwelling features of the Tianluoshan site
has been able to sufﬁciently answer some preliminary questions of
rice cultivation system between 5000 and 2500 BC.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Brief introduction of archaeological site
The Tianluoshan site (Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Relics and
Archaeology et al., 2007) is located at the edge of the Ningshao plain
in the Yangtze Delta, and 30–40 km from the east coastline. It is near
the piedmont of the Siming Mountain (Fig. 1). Presently the land is

2610

approximately 2 m above the sea level. The archaeological site was
dated between 5000 and 3000 BC, and the lowermost layer lie 310 to
350 cm below the surface. A lot of artifacts recovered from this site
include stone, wooden, and bone tools, and pottery. A large number
of upright wooden piles indicate that the dwellings were adaptive to
wetlands. Due to the good preservation of an anaerobic condition,
massive amount of organic remains are recovered. Predominantly
wild fauna included animal bones such as buffalo (Bubalus mephistopheles), deer (Cervus nippon, Cervus unicolor, Elaphurus davidianus,
etc), pig (Sus sp.), ﬁsh (Cyprinus carassius, Carassius auratus, Ophicephalus argus, etc) and many others. Seed and fruit remains included
as rice (Oryza sp.), acorns (Cyclobalanopsissp., Lithocarpus sp., Quercus
sp.), hog plum (Choerospondias axillaries), peach (Prunus persica),
mume apricot (Prunus mume), water caltrop (Trapa sp.), foxnut
(Euryale ferox), etc. A substantial number of charring or waterlogged
rice spikelets and short rachillae (spikelet bases) are morphologically

different from wild rice and some spikelets can be characterized as
domesticated rice (Zheng et al., 2007; Fuller et al., 2009). These
provided evidence of a mixed economy comprised of huntinggathering and rice cultivation.
2.2. Materials
Sediment cores were taken as 155 locations around the Tianluoshan occupation site with an interval of 20–40 m. According to
the textures, colors, and plant remain contents of soil, a coring
location was divided into several soil layers and the soil samples
were taken from the layers. From results of analysis of phytoliths
and seeds for coring samples, the area and hidden depths of
prehistoric rice ﬁelds were judged. Excavations were done in
Location 1 and Location 2 to conﬁrm this (Fig. 4). The areas were
200 and 150 square meter, respectively.

Fig. 1. Location of the Tianluoshan site, and other archaeological sites dated between 9000 and 4000 BC. The Shangshan (Jiang and Liu, 2006) and Xiaohuangshan (Zhang et al.,
2005) sites, dated between 9000 and 7000 BC and between 7000 and 6000 BC, respectively, and were located in little basins in mountainous areas. The Kuahuqiao site (Zhejiang
Provincial Institute of Relics and Archaeology and Xiaoshan Museum, 2004) dated between 6000 and 5500 BC and the Hemudu (Chekiang Province and Chekiang Provincial
Museum, 1978), the Tianluoshan sites dated between 5000 and 3000 BC, and are located at passage from upland valleys to plains. The Lujiajiao site (The work group at the Luojiajiao
site, 1981) was dated to 5000 BC. The Caoxieshan site (Fujiwara, 1998) was dates to 4000 BC, in which the Neolithic paddy ﬁelds were ﬁrstly unearthed in China.

40 soil samples for analysis of seeds, phytoliths, pollens, and
charcoal were taken from western section of T1041 trench in
Location 2, which was about 400 m southwest of the preserved
dwellings of the Tianluoshan occupation site. The samples were
continuously taken at 5 cm intervals between 45 and 250 cm below
the surface. Each sample was about 1500 ml.

2.3. Methods
2.3.1. Analysis of seeds
500 ml sample of soil was moved to 1000 ml beaker, and added
500 ml 5% NaHCO3. The sample was placed in 50  C water bath for
3 hours, while the sample was stirred well to separate soil particles.
Through a sieve (V450 mm), the sample was washed until the water
is clear. The remained sample was investigated for plant seeds with
a stereo microscope.

2.3.2. Analysis of phytoliths
Soil samples were dried in convection oven at 100  C and then
were mechanically crashed. 1 g sample of soil and 300,000 glass
beads (V40 mm) were moved to 12 ml sample bottle. 10 ml of water
and 1 ml of 5% sodium silicate were added, and the sample vibrated
in an ultrasonic cleaner (38 Khz, 250 W) for about 20 minutes to
separate particles. Using Stokes’ Law, the sample was ﬁltered in
water to remove particles less than 20 mm, and was dried again.
Using EUKITTÒ mounting medium, the ﬁltered sample was
distributed uniformly on microscope slide to facilitate the investigation of densities of phytoliths.

The rice ﬁelds associated with the Tianluoshan occupation lie
about 1 m below the surface and can be clearly distinguished
between early and later periods (Fig. 2). The early rice ﬁelds were
dated between 5000 and 4500 BC, and the later rice ﬁelds were

2.3.3. Analysis of pollens
2 cm3 of sample and 27,637 Lycopodium makers were placed in
15 ml polypropylene boiling tube, and 10 ml of 10%KOH was added.
The sample was placed in 100  C water bath for 30 minutes, while
the sample was stirred well to break any remaining lumps. Through
a sieve (V160 mm), the sample was ﬁltered into a polypropylene
centrifuge tube. The samples was washed, centrifuged, and decanted until the liquid is clear. 10 ml of 40% HF was added to the
sample and it was placed in 100  C water bath for 30–60 minutes,
and it was stirred with polypropylene rod until siliceous material is
no longer visible. It was centrifuged and decanted HF. 10 ml of 10%
HCL was added, and the sample was placed in 100  C water both for
15 minutes to remove colloidal silicon dioxide and silicoﬂuorides. It
was centrifuged, HCL was decanted, and the sample was rinsed in
water. 10 ml of acetolysis mixture (1 ml concentrated H2SO4, 9 ml
acetic anhydride) was added to the sample, which was placed in
a boiling water bath for 3 minutes, with stirring. It was centrifuged,
and a few drops 10% NaOH was added to aid dyeing, before
decanting and rinsing. Using glycerin jelly, the ﬁltered sample was
distributed uniformly on a microscope slide for investigations of
pollens.
2.3.4. Analysis of charcoal
20 ml sample of soil was moved to 100 ml beaker, and 20 ml 35%
H2O2 was added to separate soil particulars. Through a sieve
(V160 mm), the sample was washed until the water is clear. The
remained sample was investigated for charcoals with a stereo
microscope.
2.3.5. Radiocarbon dating
Using the accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) method, the
radiocarbon age of samples, mainly seeds, was determined (Table 1).
Dates were calibrated with Oxcal 3.10 and INTCAL 104 curve. The
radiocarbon dating was carried out in Peking University AMS
Laboratory.

Fig. 4. Integrated palaeoecological data from rice ﬁelds dated between 5000 and 2500 BC at the Tianluoshan site. The early and later rice ﬁelds at T1041 trench of Location 2 lie
hidden in depths between 94 and 140 cm and 200 and 235 cm, respectively. In these layers many husk fragments and spikelet bases of rice, dense bulliform phytoliths derived from
motor cells of rice, and a high percentage of grass pollen larger than 38 mm in diameter. High microcharcoal content implies that people used ﬁre in managing these ﬁelds.

dated between 4000 and 2500 BC (Table 1, Fig. 4). The early ﬁelds
lie 200 to 230 cm below the surface at Location 1 (Fig. 4) and 257 to
294 cm below at Location 2. The later ﬁelds lie 95 to 150 cm below
the surface at Location 1 (Fig. 4) and 93 to 177 cm below at Location 2.
Within the excavated area of 350 sq. meters, a 40 cm wide path
was revealed for the later period. This would have made it convenient for people to go into the ﬁeld and manage the rice stands. In
addition, wooden artfefacts and pottery sherds were found. These
included two wooden dibble sticks, and one wooden knife from the
earlier ﬁeld layer and one wooden handle of a spade from the later
ﬁeld; many bone and wooden spade remains were also found in the
settlement area (Table 2, Fig. 3). However, no evidence of an irrigation system, which should include ditches, ﬁeld ridges/bunds for
controlling drainage and water retention, was found.
3.2. Archaeological remains of rice
There were many plant remains including roots, stems, leaves,
seeds and microfossils were found in the strata of rice ﬁelds. As
showed in Fig. 4, there are also diverse remains of rice in rice ﬁelds as
well, including high densities of rice spikelets fragments, phytoliths
derived from the bulliform cells of rice, and a large number of Gramineae pollens bigger than 38 mm in diameter likely derived from
rice. There, however, no carbonized rice spikelets or husked rice were
found.
The morphological observation of rice short rachillae and husks
suggests that the rice is different from wild rice. Generally, the short
rachillae are the best characteristics for discriminating between wild
and domestication rice (Crawford and Shen, 1998). Short rachillae
were classiﬁed into two categories, a smooth wild base, and a nonsmooth or attached vestiges of broken stem domesticated base. The
short rachillae of domesticated type accounts for 47.1% in the early
ﬁelds between 5000 and 4500 BC and 59.4% in the later ﬁelds
between 3600 and 2700 BC, while wild type accounts for 52.9% in the
early ﬁelds and 40.6% in the later ﬁelds. As reported here the
domesticated ratios in the early ﬁelds appeared signiﬁcantly larger

than that from the occupation site (Fuller et al., 2009), but this is due to
a different classiﬁcation system (of three types) employed in the latter
study on the occupation site, in which the estimate of domesticated
types was therefore lower. Nevertheless the proportion of wild types
is comparable, and direction of trends over time is the same.
3.3. Archaeological remains of weeds
As Summarized in Fig. 4, many plants coexisted with rice in
those tilled ﬁelds, such as Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa sp.), Galingale (Cyperus sp.), Bulrush (Scirpus sp.), Fimbristylis (Fimbristylis
sp.), Spikesedge (Eleocharis sp.), Sedge (Carex sp.), Hornwort
(Ceratophyllum sp.), Najad (Najas sp.), Pondweed (Potamogeton sp.).
Floatingheart (Nymphoides sp.), Arrowhead (Sagittaria sp.), Duckleaf Knotweed (Persicaria sp.), Yerbadetajo (Eclipta sp.), waterchesnut (Trapa sp.), reed (Phragmites sp.). The habitat of most of
these plants is wetlands, such as the banks of rivers and streams,
marshes and wasted wetland. These species are also common
weeds in rice ﬁelds.
3.4. Areas and yields of rice ﬁelds
The investigation of stratigraphy, phytoliths and seeds by coring
in an area of 14.4 hectares showed that two rice ﬁeld strata were
distributed in the vast area around the occupation. Showed as Fig. 5,
the area of rice ﬁelds could have covered 6.3 hectares for the early
period and over 7.4 hectares for the later period. The depths range
from 100 to 200 cm for early rice ﬁelds and from 210 to 300 cm for
later rice ﬁelds. From coring samples of these strata, dense phytoliths derived from the bulliform cells of rice were detected and a lot
of remains of rice spikelts were found as well. The densities of rice
phytolith for early rice ﬁelds range from 1,000 to 90,000 grains/g,
average 18,923 grains/g. The densities of rice phytolith for later rice
ﬁelds range from 2.000 to 34,000 grains/g, average 13,010 grains/g
(Table 3).

Fig. 5. Distributions of early and later rice ﬁelds. A and B show the distribution of later and early rice ﬁelds, respectively. The ﬁgures were made based on aspects of colors,
properties, botanical remains of soil samples taken from the cores sticks. They indicate that the rice ﬁelds were located in wetlands with nearby rivers and lakes. The locations of
phytolith analysis are indicated by (see Table 2).

4. Discussions
A large number of rice remains with some domesticated characteristics found at the Tianluoshan site (Zhejiang Provincial
Institute of Relics and Archaeology et al., 2007) showed that rice
was cultivated and was undergoing the domestication process,
7000 years ago. The rice ﬁelds associated with the Tianluoshan
occupation provided some further evidence of rice cultivation
practices at that time, including the environments, area, and
methods of ﬁeld preparation. We have also estimated yields.
High densities of rice spikelet fragments, phytoliths derived from
the bulliform cells of rice, and a large number of Gramineae pollens
proved the existence of buried rice ﬁelds at Tinaluoshan. The
coexistence of short rachillae (spikelet bases) of domesticated and
wild types indicated that the selective pressure on the morphology
of rice had been exerted, but that populations retained some characteristics of wild rice. Nevertheless, these excavated ﬁelds could be
therefore recognized as the ﬁelds for rice production. Although

there are some differences in the classiﬁcation of the short rachillae
(spikelet base) (Zheng et al., 2007; Fuller et al., 2009), it is clear that
morphological evolution was ongoing and domestication had not
been fully reached yet.
The early rice ﬁelds associated with the Tianluoshan occupation
are the oldest rice ﬁelds known. They are 1000 years earlier than
the paddy ﬁelds revealed at the Caoxieshan and Chuodun sites
dated to 4000 BC (Fujiwara, 1998; Cao et al., 2006) in the Yangtze
Delta and 3000 years earlier than those of the Zhaojiazhuang site
(Jin et al., 2007) in the middle reach of the Yellow River, and also
older than ones excavated at the Chengtoushan site (Hunan
Provincial Institute of Archaeology and Cultural Relics, 2007) in the
middle regions of the Yangtze River. The Tianluoshan evidence
conﬁrmed that the people of the Hemudu culture had developed
techniques of tilling soil, sowing, and harvesting by wooden and
bone tools. This discovery provided important evidence on the
processes of rice domestication and changes in economy between
5000 and 2500 BC in east China.

Table showed densities of phytoliths derived from some grasses in possible ancient rice ﬁeld strata of 37 coring places. The densities of rice phytoliths of E3N3, E5S12, E7S16,
E9S10 places were unconventionally high, and when the coring were carried out, a lot of wooden remains were also found from those areas as well, so there might be many
stacking straws of rice in the ancient dwellings. The means were calculated except for above 4 places.

Rice ﬁelds can be divided into various types, including paddy ﬁelds
and unimproved seasonally ﬂooded lands. Paddy ﬁelds are lands with
ridges for planting rice, and bunds and canals for storing water and
moving water. In unimproved ﬁelds water derives from rainfall and
natural ﬂoods and has no irrigation facilities. Appearance of irrigation
facilities marks the start of more intensive forms of management and
an agricultural technique for increased productivity. Both early and
later Tianluoshan rice ﬁelds, without irrigation systems, could be
suggested that the irrigation of them could have been dependant on
rain water and water stored in the marsh. They were different from
those recovered from the Caoxieshan and Chuodun sites dated to
4000 BC (Fujiwara, 1998; Cao et al., 2006; Fuller and Qin, 2009).
Caoxieshan and Chuodun excavations have revealed the small artiﬁcial features of ﬁeld units, which were connected by channels to some
deeply dug reservoir pits dug, which ensured tight control of water
levels. The later Tianluoshan rice ﬁelds, dated between 4000 and 2500
BC, were well-matched, even much later than ones at Caoxieshan and
Chuodun sites in age, suggested that differences between them were
perhaps regional, rather than chronological.
The Yangtze Delta is located in a subtropical monsoon climatic
zone. Spring is moist and has some rain. In summer, this region is
hot and humid due to the control by warm tropical air currents and
typhoons. In autumn it is cool and relatively dry. Winter is cold and

moist. The seasonal rainfall responsible for annual ﬂooding might
satisfy the need of irrigation of rice growth. The markedly abundant
micro-charcoals in the deposits of rice ﬁelds compared to other
strata imply that ﬁring could be applied to rice cultivation. Burning
during the dry season might be a common method of ﬁeld
managements in early agriculture for clearing dead twigs and
withered leaves of plants in crop ﬁelds (Anderson, 2005; Zong et al.,
2007; Atahan et al., 2008; Fuller and Qin, 2009).
In the rice ﬁeld, there are not only rice plants, but a number of
wetland plants inferred to be the weeds of ancient rice ﬁelds. The
analyses of seeds showed that the seed bank could have been
26,000–228,000 individuals/m2 for the early rice ﬁelds and
26,000–184,000 individuals/m2 for the later rice ﬁelds. It is
remarkably higher than 9,140–47,452 individuals/m2 for modern
paddy ﬁelds nearby wetland and even higher than 83,499–10,9141
individuals/m2 for secondary wetland (Feng et al., 2008). Generally,
the seed bank and species number in paddy ﬁelds reclaimed from
wetland would decrease. High seed banking and species diversity
indicated that little or even no weeding was applied to the
management of the rice ﬁelds dating between 5000 and 2500 BC.
High dense phytoliths and its body remains of reed implied that the
rice ﬁelds could have been developed from reed-marsh and reed
probably intruded into the ﬁelds and grew with rice.

Climatic amelioration at the end of the Pleistocene markedly
altered the ecology in China and led to changes in human adaptations (Zhao and Piperno, 2000; Lu et al., 2002). The Yangtze Delta
witnessed a period of high sea level between 5000 and 4000 BC (Xu
and Shen, 1990). During the regression interval, seawater regressed
and large areas of land were exposed and left behind a number of
lakes. As salinity in soil had fallen, a freshwater environment
appeared. Wetland plants ﬂourished and dominated the edge of
water habitats. There were also mammals, waterfowl, and freshwater ﬁsh. The excavation of occupation provided data for reconstructing resource exploitation. People migrated and settled here
7000 years ago. In addition to planting rice, they lived on gathering
wild fruits growing on highlands, such as acorns, peaches, and
plums, and nuts in lakes, such as water caltrop and foxnut. They
hunted buffalo, deer, and birds and harvested carp, snakehead,
crucian, and terrapin in lake. The tools and the ecological analysis of
buried rice ﬁelds suggest the mode of rice cultivation between 5000
and 2500 BC was based on natural ﬂood recession and seasonal
rainfall. Before spring rain, the soil was tilled to a certain extent with
wooden and bone spades, and seeding was done with dibble sticks
after the ground was cleared by ﬁring. Sprouted rice grew well in
wetlands ﬁlled by the monsoonal rain while the wetland weeds
ﬂourished as well. In the autumn, as the rain decreased, water
accumulated in wetland lowered and people later harvested mature
rice, perhaps by picking or cutting the base of the inﬂorescences. The
wooden knife, which could be used for cutting ears of rice, implied
that the harvest sometime was with the help of some tools. Some
time after harvest but before sowing ﬁre was used to clear ﬁelds.
The cultivation system was thus a form of low-level food
production. According to the ratio of rice phytoliths to spikelets
(Fujiwara, 1979) and service life of the rice ﬁelds, the rice yields are
estimated as 830 kg per hectare for the early period and 950 kg per
hectare for the later period. Based on this estimation, the annual
yields might have been about 5000 kg for 6.3 hectares of the early
period and 7000 kg for 7.4 hectares of the later period. This
suggests that the rice could support no more than 30 persons.
However, some ethnographic data show that a village living
dominantly on hunting-gathering subsistence has 25–100 persons
while one involved in agricultural economy has 150–300 persons
(Tanter, 1988). Obviously, even though people at Tianluoshan
cultivated rice, the production was relatively low-level and
hunting-gathering provided a substantial proportion of food in
their diet, as indicated by macro-remains of acorns, Trapa, and
other wild foods from the occupation area (Fuller et al., 2009).
Domestication of crops is not a rapid, but is a protracted process
(Allaby et al., 2008). The vast early rice ﬁelds combined with the
mixed wild and cultigen phenotypes indicate that rice cultivation
and domestication had originated earlier. Recent discoveries of rice
remains dated between 9000 and 7000 BC in the Yangtze Delta
implied that rice cultivation may have originated in some small
basins located in mountainous areas as early as 10,000 years ago
(Jiang and Liu, 2006; Zheng et al., 2007). The earliest evidence for
cultivation of rice in the Yangtze Delta also can be contrasted with
the evidence from 1000s of years later in Southeast Asia, indicating
that the Yangtze regions are original areas of domesticated rice, and
from this area, rice was carried to Southeast Asia (Fuller and Sato,
2008).
