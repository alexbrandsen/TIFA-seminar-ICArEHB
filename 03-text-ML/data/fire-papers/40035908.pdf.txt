secured the points in the foreshafts (Figure 2). After

a few shots, we found that we needed to wrap the
foreshaft/shaft connection with strapping tape to
help hold the foreshaft in place.
The arrow shafts were a lightweight cedar. The

main shafts had plastic nocks, feather fletching,
and weighed about 20.5 grams each, with little vari-

ation. The flexibility (spine) of the mainshafts was
correlated to the bow's draw strength.

In our first experiment, many arrows were
deflected off the target. This was a problem in other

experiments as well. Odell and Cowan (1986:202)
observed that many of their arrows, tipped with
chert points, were deflected at a higher rate than

occurred in a previous experiment conducted by
Flenniken (unpublished). They suggested that Flenniken's use of sharp, bifacial obsidian points could

have enhanced penetrating power and worked
against deflection. However, our experiments used

sharp, bifacial obsidian points; and the distance
between the carcass and archer was also the same.

The greatest difference between our two experi-

ments was that in the second the arrows' spines
were matched to the bow's pull. Arrows that are
mismatched to a bow's pull can wobble, especially
early in their flight, strike the target at an angle, and

ricochet. With the arrows' spines matched to the
bow's pull, only four shots in the second experiment were deflected. Odell and Cowan did not

match the arrows' spines to the bow's pull (Odell,

personal communication, 2005) and this may
account for some of the deflection. Odell and

Cowan also found that unretouched points had a
higher rate of deflection than retouched points.
Arguing that it was difficult to haft unretouched
points in such a way as to establish a "symmetrical line from the tip through the body of the stone,"

tions. Field-dressing was necessary for the recovery of each point after it was shot. We do not think
that the carcass's field-dressed condition influenced

the results since it is bone, rather than internal
organs, that breaks points.
