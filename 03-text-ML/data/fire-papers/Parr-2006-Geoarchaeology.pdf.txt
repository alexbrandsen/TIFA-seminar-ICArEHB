Dark-colored phytoliths are often found preserved in paleosols and archaeological sediments.
Some practitioners believe these darkened phytoliths provide evidence of fire histories, while
others suggest alternative reasons for their occurrence. This study examines the effect of fire
on phytolith appearance and discusses the extent to which color may be used as proxy evidence for fire. The results of this study demonstrate that under oxidative conditions of openair fire, the color of phytoliths can be altered, although dark-colored phytoliths also occur naturally in some unburned plant species. Despite some overlap observed between burned and
unburned color in phytoliths, clear differences are apparent in the way this color appears
optically. In particular, transparent and opalescent qualities were found to occur in nature as
opposed to a dull opaque appearance of charred phytoliths. Although fire-induced color
change is probably limited to a portion of the phytolith assemblage, phytolith color remains
a tool that can be confidently used to indicate the presence of fire in various sedimentary
contexts. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
Presence of charred microfossils, such as charcoal particles in sediments, has
played an important role in the identification of fire and its occurrence in prehistoric landscapes. Charred particle counts have often been used as a proxy indicator
of human activity, such as swidden agricultural on prehistoric landscapes (Singh
et al., 1981; James, 1989; Piperno, 1994; Kirch, 1996; Haberle et al., 2001; Haberle
and Ledru, 2001). Similarly, presence of charred material may also be used as an
indicator of environmental change and natural fires (Salisburry and Jane, 1940;
Godwin and Tansley, 1941; Johns, 1989; Schmidt et al., 1999). Black- and/or browncolored fossil phytoliths are often found well preserved in paleosols and archaeological sediments. Although these colored phytoliths can be found within stratigraphic layers containing lenses of charred material, they are also observed in
sediments where no other evidence of burning is visible. In this study, I discuss the
nature of color variation found in phytoliths, the likelihood of color change resulting from burning and, if this occurs, the potential use of black and/or brown phytoliths as proxy indicators of prehistoric natural fire, slash-and-burn agriculture,
and/or food processing in archaeological and paleoenvironmental studies.

A number of previous studies found that heating plant material up to 500°C in
a muffle furnace (to produce a phytolith reference collection) will not affect the
visible morphological characteristics of phytoliths (Piperno, 1988; Bowdery, 1989;
Runge, 1998; Parr, Dolic, et al., 2001). On the other hand, Boyd (2002), has reported
ashing of plant samples at 300–500°C in a laboratory kiln to simulate the burning
of phytoliths by fire and the production of colored carbon inclusions. I interpret
the term “carbon inclusions” used by Boyd (2002) as being a post-fire phenomenon, as opposed to the precursor natural carbon occluded in phytoliths during
their formation within the plant (Parr and Sullivan, 2005). This occluded carbon
does not need the presence of fire to form, and has been used in studies for radiocarbon dating, soil-carbon analysis, and identifying changing proportions of C3 and
C4 plants in paleovegetation through carbon isotope analysis (Wilding, 1967;
Wilding et al., 1967; Kelly et al., 1991; Golchin et al., 1994; Fredlund and Tieszen,
1997; Houyuan et al., 2000; Krull et al., 2003; Parr and Sullivan, 2005). It is also
known that heating above 500°C and in particular, exposure to temperatures above
700°C, causes the refractive indices of phytoliths to change (Jones and Milne,
1963; Elbaum et al., 2003) . In addition, high temperatures are known to promote
warping of phytoliths (Kealhofer and Penny, 1998; Runge, 1998; Parr and Boyd,
2002). Direct contact with fire is widely assumed to induce darkening (charring)
of phytoliths (Piperno, 1988; Guderjan and Bozarth, 2000; Kealhofer, 2003; Parr,
2003). Subsequently, Piperno (1988) suggested that the discoloration of phytoliths
induced by fire might be used as an “index of the presence and intensity of prehistoric firing of the vegetation” (p. 45). Kealhofer (1996) used the discoloration
of phytoliths to describe burning regimes at Lake Kumphawapi in northeastern
Thailand, and pointed out that although not all phytoliths appeared burned, some
discolored types were observed for each vegetation category identified.
However, not all practitioners support the interpretation that most dark-colored
phytoliths are burned. For example, some would argue that there is little empirical evidence for change in the color of phytoliths attributable to burning and that
dark phytoliths may actually represent natural coloring. Such a suggestion is
extremely important as it brings into question the use of dark-colored phytoliths
as indicators of fire.
It is known that both black- and brown-colored phytoliths also occur naturally in
various plant species. For example, a few Myrtaceae species have been observed to
contain black phytoliths and some Poaceae species produce transparent brown phytoliths (Figure 1). No doubt, other researchers will have noted further examples of
coloration in their own comparative phytolith reference collections. Wilding et al.
(1967) suggested that natural opaque black-colored phytoliths are probably caused,
in part, by the occluded carbon but, in some cases, may also be related to iron or manganese staining from the soil solution.
These phenomena raise the question of whether or not fire distinctively affects the
color of phytoliths and, if so, can the color observed in the burned phytoliths be differentiated from the naturally occurring black and brown phytoliths produced by
some plant species.

METHODS
There are two main parts to the methodologies used in this study:
1.

2.

Laboratory experiments: A number of plant samples were acquired from various sources (Table I). A set of subsamples from these species was burned to simulate the production of charred phytoliths from natural and/or human-induced
fire episodes. Phytoliths were also extracted from a subset of these samples to
represent an unburned portion for comparison with burned fractions.
Comparative analysis: Unburned phytoliths extracted from the subsamples of
those species listed in Table I, together with naturally discolored phytoliths
from species listed in Table II, were compared in color and appearance to the
burned phytoliths described above. Comparisons were also made using burned
phytoliths extracted from firefighting masks, as well as samples suspected of
being burned that had been collected from an archaeological site.

Phytoliths may occur in many plant parts, for example, leaves, glumes, seed cases,
the spathe, etc. Of these, the epidermis of leaves is, by far, the most common location for the production of phytoliths. Plant leaves may dry in situ, as is the case
with grasses or may dry on the ground after abscission from trees and shrubs.
Therefore, the dry leaf portion of a plant is one of the most common parts to acquire
burned phytoliths during a fire. For this reason, samples used in this study were
restricted to leaf and associated stem material.
Burned Phytoliths
Fires may be high or low temperature. High-temperature firing facilities were not available in-house at the time of the study; therefore, I collected a 20-kg sample of Saccharum
officinarum (L.) leaf and pith waste product (ash and phytoliths), from NSW Sugar
Cooperative Pty Ltd, northern New South Wales (NSW), Australia. This sample had

been burned in a cogeneration electricity incinerator at 1200°C, representing a grassphytolith fraction burned at high temperature. Fan-forced incineration occurs in a metal
enclosure approximately 4 m long  4 m wide and 3 m high with a series of double-glazed
inspection windows for observation. Timing of this process was not possible as tons of
cane are continuously fed into the incinerator and as the material is ashed, it drops
onto a conveyer belt below where a sample can be obtained. Material acquired from this
procedure was the only sample used in the study of known temperature.

EFFECT OF FIRE ON PHYTOLITH COLORATION

Subsamples from the leaf material of a range of plant species were used as controls for low-temperature burning (Table II). Some of the species selected for this
part of the study are considered to have been economically important in southwestern Pacific prehistory and, as such, they were chosen because experimental
burning might provide comparative proxy evidence for food processing. This leaf
material was dried at 70°C in a fan-forced drier for 12 hours. Approximately 3 g of
subsample from each species was placed in a 1000-mL beaker in a fume hood. The
samples were then ignited and allowed to burn until reduced to ash. No temperature control was used during this stage of the experiment. While the lack of temperature control on these samples limits the study to observations and comparisons of known burned and unburned material, it was considered sufficiently
rigorous to answer the research questions:
1.
2.

Does fire distinctively affect the color of phytoliths?
If so, can the color observed in the burned phytoliths be differentiated from the
naturally occurring black and brown phytoliths produced by some plant species?

All burned samples were cleaned using a rapid and volatile acid treatment comprising 8 mL of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and 4 mL of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) until the
reaction stopped. This procedure was introduced to remove any external burned
and/or other organic material adhered to the outer surface of the phytoliths. (Warning:
Caution is required when using this preparation—adding H2O2 to H2SO4 should be
done a few drops at a time.)
Unburned Phytoliths
Phytoliths were extracted from 0.5 g of a subsample from each species listed in
Table II using the microwave method described in Parr, Dolic, et al. (2001) to represent
controls for the unburned phytolith fraction during comparative analyses.
Other Comparative Material
Reference material from a previous study (Parr, 2003) containing unburned, naturally discolored phytoliths were selected for colorimetric and physiological comparative analysis with the burned samples produced in this study (Tables I and II).
In addition, phytoliths that were previously assumed to be burned, from an archaeological site at Numundo, West New Britain, PNG and dated at ~5900 yr B.P., were
selected for comparative analysis against known burned phytoliths produced during
this study (Parr, 2003). The aim of using these archaeological samples was to compare their color and appearance with unburned, naturally discolored, and burned
control samples to confirm or refute previous assumptions. Also, phytoliths from
10 firefighting masks that had been worn during hot grass fires in northeastern NSW
Australia during 2002 represent burned phytoliths from an authentic bushfire.
Although these phytoliths were not burned under controlled conditions, they offered
another means by which comparisons could be made with phytoliths from unburned,
naturally discolored, and burned control samples.

Preparation and Observation
After the acid washing described above, samples were placed into centrifuge
tubes and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 3 minutes; the supernatant was then
decanted. This wash process was repeated with distilled water. Centrifuge tubes
containing samples were then topped-up with 1 mL of ethanol. Approximately 0.5
mL of agitated sample from both the burned and unburned fractions was removed
with a pipette and placed onto two warm microscope slides. Once the ethanol
had evaporated, two drops of benzyl benzoate were placed onto each slide, followed by a coverslip. Edges of the coverslip were sealed with Depex mounting
medium (Merck Pty. Ltd., Kilsyth, Vic 3137, Australia) to prevent the benzyl benzoate from dispersing. Slides were scanned on an Olympus CX40 trinocular compound microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) at 400 magnification, and
digital images of phytoliths were captured. Phytoliths are described where possible using the International code of Phytolith Nomenclature (Madella et al., 2003).
To help determine if discoloration of phytoliths subjected to firing could be distinguished from those that occur naturally in some species, the color hue range of each
sample was determined using a Munsell Soil Color Chart (Munsell Colour, 1994).

RESULTS
Unburned Phytoliths
Unburned species with natural dark coloring are listed in Table II. Examples of
these are Poaceae, Andropogon viginicus, and the Myrtaceae species Callistemon sp.,
Syzigium brevicymum (Figure 1). All other unburned phytoliths extracted from leaf
samples were observed to be transparent silica (Table II; Figures 2a, 4a, 4c, and 6a).
Burned Phytoliths
Orange-yellow flames of up to ~1.2 m could be observed through the doubleglazed inspection windows of the sugarcane electricity cogeneration incinerator.
For this Saccharum officinarum sample, incineration was set at 1200°C. Around
75% of phytoliths from this sample were observed to be opaque black and brown
colors after acid cleaning (Figures 2c, 2f, 2i, and 3c). However, phytoliths that did
remain transparent in this sample were warped (Figure 2c, 2f). Some phytoliths were
reduced to irregular spherical shapes due to melting.
Experimental burning of leaf material in beakers produced a yellow flame that persisted for approximately 1 to 2 minutes followed by slow smoldering, leaving a blackcolored ash. After acid washing of the ash, it was noted that discoloration of some
phytoliths had occurred in all samples. This discoloration ranged from dull opaque
brown to black colors (Table III). Discoloration occurs in varying amounts from
around 25% and up to about 50% of the observed phytoliths. All samples burned in
beakers produced similar results. For Saccharum officinarum samples, the bilobate phytoliths became slightly discolored by a brown tinge and the central areas

centers (Figure 2b, 2e). Some minor warping was observed in odd Saccharum officinarum long-cell phytoliths.

the Saccharum officinarum fraction burned at 1200°C, are compared to other burned
phytoliths from a firefighting mask and those from the archaeological site in Figure
3. For each of these phytolith fractions, block-shaped phytoliths appear blackened
in the centers with clearer cell walls or edges (Figure 3a, 3d, 3g–i). Other species that
were burned in beakers had similar results to those of the Saccharum officinarum
fraction reported above (Figures 4 and 5).
Munsell Color
Natural-colored phytoliths from the species listed in Table II fall within four main
Munsell colors (Table III). Long-cells had transparent centers in the 7.5YR 5/2 color
range with darker edges of 7.5YR 2.5/1. Bilobate and some spherical phytoliths were
transparent 7.5YR 2.5/1. Other spheres observed, particularly Myrtaceae sp., were all
opalescent black. Burned discolored phytoliths ranged from 7.5YR 5/4 to black
(Tables I and III). These phytoliths were predominantly opaque brown and black. The
fraction heated to 1200°C had color changes that ranged from 7.5YR 4/1 to grey 1 2.5/N
or predominantly opaque grey to black (Table III).
DISCUSSION
Results suggest that fire, albeit selectively, most certainly affected the color of
some of the phytoliths observed. One significant observation arising from this
study is that while some of the phytoliths burned in the beakers appear charred,
others in the same sample show little or no effects from burning. A likely explanation for this result is that when the plant samples were first ignited in the beakers,
the flame was intense and a hotspot occurred where oxidation was taking place.
However, once the flame extinguished itself (possibly from a lack of fuel and/or oxygen in the beaker), slow smoldering resulted in incomplete oxidation. Such hotspots

can be observed in natural grass fires where a tuft of grass ignites rapidly, the
flame quickly extinguishes, and smoldering follows (personal observation). As a
point of interest, I have not personally observed a whole phytolith assemblage to
be black and/or brown during the analysis of archaeological sites. Significantly, a
similar observation was reported by Kealhofer (1996) when describing phytolith
evidence for burning regimes at Lake Kumphawapi in northeastern Thailand. In that
study, Kealhofer (1996) pointed out that not all phytoliths observed in the examined assemblages appeared to be burned. Thus, the 25–50% charring reported for

experimental burning in the results may reflect the possible maximum percentage of black and/or brown phytoliths that could be expected to occur in paleolandscapes because of fire.
Issues With Prior Assumptions
It has been assumed previously that the extraction of phytoliths from plant material using a muffle furnace for ashing would simulate the effect of a natural fire.
However, this is not necessarily true. There are two main variables associated with
fire that will affect the characteristics of phytoliths: temperature and the process
of oxidation. Previous studies have demonstrated that high temperatures (as can be
experienced with a muffle furnace) are known to affect the refractive indices of
phytoliths (Jones and Milne, 1963; Elbaum et al., 2003) and promote warping of
phytoliths (Kealhofer and Penny, 1998; Runge, 1998; Parr and Boyd, 2002). In addition, Boyd (2002) has inferred color change and the production of carbon inclusions in phytoliths using a laboratory kiln at 300–500°C for ashing plant material.
However, a number of other studies have demonstrated that, at temperatures not
exceeding 500°C, color changes in phytoliths after ashing in a muffle furnace and
acid washing are uncommon (Jones and Milne, 1963; Bowdery, 1989; Runge, 1998;
Parr, Lentfer, et al., 2001; Wallis, 2003). Explanation for this phenomenon may be
closely related to the occurrence reported above where, during oxidation, some
phytoliths were affected by color change while others were not. The question that

arises from this observation is, does the discoloration of phytoliths occur from complete oxidation or incomplete oxidation of plant material? This question requires further experimental testing. Nevertheless, some observations can be made to help
understand the process of oxidation during firing events.
Observations of Burned Phytoliths
When using a muffle furnace to extract phytoliths from herbarium specimens,
there is limited air available during combustion. That is, there is a lack of oxygen
within the muffle furnace itself, no flame, and the use of lidded crucibles, or ashing between microscope slides would further impede airflow during the combustion process. Alternatively, in a bushfire or in burning experiments, such as
those outlined in this study, airflow is available and flames are visible. Therefore,
observations made during this study indicate that for color changes to take place
in phytoliths, oxidation requires sufficient airflow and the production of flames
such as that found in natural open fires. Significantly, flames were observed during the firing of the sugarcane cogeneration system and the beaker experiment,
both of which resulted in discoloration of phytoliths (Figures 2b, 2c, 2e, 2f, 2h, 2i,
and 3a, 3b, 3c). While the process of phytolith discoloration may be explained
relatively easily, differentiating between colors induced by fire (Figures 2–5; Tables
I and III) and those occurring naturally in some phytoliths (Figure 1; Tables I and
II) could be more problematic.

Munsell Color
The use of a Munsell color chart was, for the most part, inconclusive, as there is
some overlap in the color spectrum between natural color and fire-induced color
(Table III). Although some of the colors observed in charred phytoliths appear different from those occurring in nature, they are very close and, as such, can be viewed
as subjective (Table III). Thus, the question of how to differentiate between natural
and fire-induced colors in phytoliths remains unresolved. Nevertheless, comparative analysis of phytolith appearance was more successful for differentiating between
natural and fire-induced discoloration.
Comparative Analysis
Results of microscopic observations of phytoliths indicated two clear differences
in appearance between naturally occurring and fire-induced varieties. Naturally colored brown phytoliths were observed to be transparent with light brown centers (c.
7.5YR 5/2) with darker edges (7.5YR 2.5/1), while spheres were opaque opalescent
(7.5YR 2.5/1 to black; Figure 1; Table III). Alternatively, the phytoliths from the samples burned in a beaker and incinerated at 1200°C, as well as those collected from
the firefighting masks, had a predominantly dull, opaque appearance (Figures 2b,
2c, and 5). Significantly, phytoliths from the beaker experiment, the sugarcane cogeneration incinerator, and the firefighting masks were all exposed to flames. Another
significant observation was that block and bulliform phytoliths often, but not always,
had darkened centers with the outer cell wall remaining clear (Figures 3a, 3d, 3g, 5h,
and 6b). A good example of this is the comparison of Orysa sativa bulliform cells
before and after exposure to fire (Figure 6). It is important to note here that the
182

DOI: 10.1002/GEA

EFFECT OF FIRE ON PHYTOLITH COLORATION

archaeological samples shown at the bottom of Figure 3g–i have darkened centers
with clear outer cells, as described above. Hence, it may be safe to assume that the
characteristics observed in these particular phytoliths confirm their past exposure
to fire. Therefore, results indicate that, although there is some overlap between natural color and that resulting from fire, there are also some distinct visual differences
that indicate exposure to fire.
As the processes producing charred phytoliths are further examined, it is likely
that exceptions to these results will be discovered. After all, there are anomalies or
exceptions to the rule found in most methodologies. Elbaum et al. (2003), for example, reported that phytoliths extracted directly from a hearth had no apparent change
in their refractive index, and yet they found refractive indices generally a useful indicator of fire. It is clear from such studies that no single method holds all the answers
and that a combination of approaches is always preferable (Parr and Boyd, 2002).
CONCLUSION
This study has demonstrated that under the oxidative conditions of fire, particularly exposure to flame, the color of phytoliths can definitely be changed. The majority of this discoloration will remain even after the phytoliths are subjected to acid
washing, indicating possible long-term color change. Despite the overlap observed
between natural and fire-induced Munsell color hues, clear differences occur in the
way this color appears when observed through the microscope. In particular, naturally occurring colors have a transparent and opalescent appearance, as opposed to
the dull opaque finish of charred phytoliths. Although this color change is probably
limited to a portion of the phytolith assemblage, if applied while considering the
general appearance as well, the color of phytoliths remains a tool that can be confidently used to indicate the presence of fire in prehistory.
