The Early Stone Age sites of Gadeb (Ethiopian South-East Plateau) were excavated under the direction of
Desmond Clark in the 1970s. Dated to between 1.45 and 0.7 Ma, Gadeb proved that humans had already
occupied high altitude areas in the Lower Pleistocene. Despite the importance of the Gadeb sites, their
lithic assemblages were never published in detail, and no review of the stone tools has ever been
reported since the original 1970s study. This paper updates the information available on Gadeb by
presenting a systematic review of the lithic technology of several assemblages. The objectives are to
evaluate the technological skills of Gadeb knappers and to contextualize them into the current discussion
of the origins of the Acheulean and its possible coexistence with the so-called Developed Oldowan in
East Africa.

Introduction
The region of the Upper Webi-Shebelle (East-Central Ethiopia) is
one of the earliest paleoanthropological areas ever discovered in
Africa. The expedition of Bourg de Bozas visited this region,
including the then called Ghedeb, in 1901, and Brumpt collected
Early Stone Age material that would eventually be studied by Breuil
and Kelley (1936). During World War II, Desmond Clark visited this
area and described the sedimentary deposits of the Upper Webi
Shebele in detail (Clark, 1954). However, this and a subsequent visit
in the 1960s by Bonneﬁlle et al. (1970) did not materialize into
excavations. Full scale excavations in Gadeb were conducted in
1975 and 1977, under a project led by Desmond Clark in easterncentral Ethiopia, but did not continue further. In 1990, limited
ﬁeldwork conducted in the area focused on the sampling of
deposits for stratigraphic correlations (Haileab and Brown, 1994).
No further ﬁeldwork has since been reported, probably due to the
damming of the Upper Webi Shebele, which in the 1980s partially
ﬂooded the sediments. At present, some of the deposits are still
under water, although part of the sedimentary sequence is exposed
(personal observation; Fig. 1F and G).
Large scale excavations by Desmond Clark led to a number of
studies of the lithics (Kurashina, 1978, 1987; Clark and Kurashina,
1979a, 1979b; Clark, 1980, 1987), geology (Williams et al., 1979;
Assefa et al., 1982; Eberz et al., 1988) and environment (Bonneﬁlle,

1983). Work in Gadeb has had considerable inﬂuence on recent
literature and references to the sequence of Gadeb are common in
Early Stone Age publications of the last few decades (e.g., Stiles,
1980; Isaac, 1981, 1982, 1984; Klein, 1983; Binford, 1985; Roche
et al., 1988; James, 1989; Féblot-Augustins, 1990; Potts, 1991;
Bar-Yosef and Goren-Inbar, 1993; Gowlett, 1993; Schick and Toth,
1994; Sahnouni, 1998; McBrearty, 2001; Goren-Inbar et al., 2002;
Semaw et al., 2009).
The Gadeb record has contributed to a variety of paleoanthropological discussions. For example, Clark and Kurashina (1979a)
emphasized the importance of Gadeb as the earliest evidence of
human occupation in high altitudes, a point also highlighted by
Roche et al. (1988). The presence of some obsidian handaxes,
considered to be imported from a source 100 km away (Clark and
Kurashina, 1979a), has also been mentioned as early evidence of
long distance transfer of raw materials (e.g., Féblot-Augustins, 1990).
Documentation of burned rocks in Gadeb 8E (Barbetti et al., 1980)
has been repeatedly claimed as possible early evidence for the use of
ﬁre (Gowlett et al., 1981; James, 1989; Bellomo, 1993). Likewise, the
partial skeleton of a hippopotamus in Gadeb 8F was interpreted as
an early case of a butchery site (Clark and Kurashina, 1979a; Clark,
1987), and referred to as such by other authors (Isaac, 1984;
McBrearty, 2001). Finally, Gadeb is also known for the purported
inter-stratiﬁcation of Developed Oldowan and Acheulean sites
throughout the sequence (Clark and Kurashina, 1979a), a claim that
has been widely discussed in recent years (Stiles, 1980; Isaac, 1981;
Binford, 1985; Potts, 1991; Bar-Yosef and Goren-Inbar, 1993; Schick
and Toth, 1994; Kyara, 1999; de la Torre, 2008).

Despite regular referencing to Gadeb in recent literature on the
East African Early Stone Age, no revision of the lithic assemblages
has been carried out since the original studies by Clark and Kurashina in the 1970s. In fact, the only systematic account of the Gadeb

assemblages (Kurashina, 1978) was never published, and no other
detailed reports of the lithics were made available. This paper aims
to update information about these sites, through a full analysis of
lithics from all the so-called Developed Oldowan assemblages

(Gadeb 2E, 2B, 2C and 8F), which are compared with the Acheulean
site of Gadeb 8D. Based on a technological approach, which confers
great importance to qualitative descriptions and graphic illustration of lithics, the objective of this paper is to present a systematic
report of each assemblage, assess the effects of post-depositional
processes on the sites, evaluate the knapping skills involved, and
discuss the relevance of the Gadeb assemblages in the broader
context of Early Pleistocene technologies in East Africa.
Geological and chronostratigraphic background
The Gadeb archaeological sites are located in the upper reaches
of the Webi Shebele River, on the Ethiopian South-East Plateau,
between the Bale and Kakka Mountains (Fig. 1). At elevations of
2300e2400 m above sea level, the Webi Shebele meanders across
the Gadeb plain for approximately 60 km and cuts through a series
of old lake and ﬂuvial sediments regularly interbedded with
volcanic ash deposits. The sedimentary sequence begins with the
Gadeb Formation (Assefa et al., 1982), composed of lacustrine
claystones and diatomites. Lake Gadeb was formed 2.71 Ma, when
basaltic lavas dammed the upper Webi Shebele (Williams et al.,
1979). It is estimated that this lake occupied a shallow basin of
30  10 km in extent (Clark and Kurashina, 1979b), and was at least
40 m deep (Williams et al., 1979). Diatomites, silt, mud and clays
with interbedded sands and ash characterize this >30 m thick
Gadeb Formation (Assefa et al., 1982; Eberz et al., 1988), which had
a cooler climate than at present (Bonneﬁlle, 1983). The Gadeb
Formation (Fig. 1) is overlain by the 10 m thick Adaba Formation
(Assefa et al., 1982), composed of weathered ash beds beneath an
ignimbrite dated by K/Ar at 2.35 Ma, which caps the lacustrine
sequence (Williams et al., 1979; Eberz et al., 1988).
This welded tuff or Adaba ignimbrite is overlain by the Mio Goro
Formation (Assefa et al., 1982), in which a pumice mudﬂow from the
base of the sequence yielded a K/Ar age of 1.45 Ma (Eberz et al., 1988).
This suggests that between 2.35 Ma and 1.5 Ma, there was a period of
non-sedimentation (Haileab and Brown, 1994). The 20 m thick Mio
Goro Formation lies unconformably over the Gadeb Formation and is
the top of the Gadeb sedimentation sequence. It is made up of
ﬂuviatile sands, sandstones and mudstones interbedded with clays,
tuffs, ash, paleosols, gravels and conglomerates, which correspond to
streams ﬂowing from the surrounding uplands that deposited alluvial fans and gravel banks (Clark and Kurashina, 1979b; Williams
et al., 1979; Assefa et al., 1982; Eberz et al., 1988). This change from
lake to river depositional processes caused widespread erosion of the
lower lacustrine levels, so that riverine deposits were banked against
older lake sediments (Eberz et al., 1988).
Despite intensive survey, no archaeological traces were found in
the older lacustrine sediments of the Gadeb Formation (Clark and
Kurashina, 1979b), and the entire archaeological sequence corresponds to the ﬂuviatile deposits within the Mio Goro Formation.
Apart from Gadeb 2A, all archaeological sites at Gadeb postdate the
1.45 Ma pumice, but are older than 0.7 Ma on the basis of the
reverse paleomagnetic polarity of the deposits (Clark and
Kurashina, 1979a; Williams et al., 1979; Assefa et al., 1982; Eberz
et al., 1988). This is conﬁrmed by tephra correlations between
Gadeb and the Turkana Basin (Haileab and Brown, 1994), supporting a 1.45e0.7 Ma time interval for the Gadeb archaeological
sites (see also Brown, 1994).
At the eastern end of the Gadeb plain, both sides of the Webi
Gorge preserve up to 5 m thick gravel deposits, where some
abraded artefacts are found (Clark, 1980). Nearer to the central and
western parts of the plain, the gravel deposits are thinner and
spread within channels, and exposures occur usually in the
meanders of the Webi Shebele. It is in these gravels and ﬁnegrained ﬂuvio-lacustrine sediments from the central part of the

Gadeb plain that Desmond Clark and colleagues (Clark and
Williams, 1978; Clark and Kurashina, 1979a; Clark, 1980; etc)
concentrated their archaeological excavations.
Clark discovered three main localities: Gadeb 2 and Gadeb 8
(Fig. 1), each of them bearing several archaeological sites, and
Gadeb 25. The latter is mentioned in some sources (Clark and
Kurashina, 1979a; Assefa et al., 1982), but was never studied in
detail, or even mentioned in the most comprehensive analysis of
the Gadeb assemblages (Kurashina, 1978). The Gadeb 2 and Gadeb 8
localities share a similar ﬂuvial depositional sequence, which starts
with basaltic gravels and feldspathic sands, continues with alternating feldspathic and pumiceous layers, and is capped with
massive pumice sediments (Williams et al., 1979).
According to Clark and Williams (1978) and Clark and Kurashina
(1979a), the main cliff section at Gadeb 2 was 22 m high, with
diatomites corresponding to the lake cycles in the lower part
(Gadeb Formation). This is overlain with a marked erosional break
by the Mio Goro Formation, with alternating ﬂuvial gravels, sands
and diatomaceous clays, and capped by a sandstone level (see also
Assefa et al., 1982). Archaeological assemblages lie in shallow
stream channels in the upper part of deposits. There is, however,
some uncertainty as to the number of sites present in Gadeb 2.
Clark and Williams (1978) listed three sites (Gadeb 2B, Gadeb 2C
and Gadeb 2D), whereas Assefa et al. (1982) mentioned four (Gadeb
2A, Gadeb 2B, Gadeb 2C and Gadeb 2D). Other archaeologicallyfocused publications (Kurashina, 1978; Clark and Kurashina, 1979a,
1979b; Clark, 1980; etc) reported four sites (Gadeb 2A, Gadeb 2B,
Gadeb 2C and Gadeb 2E), but Gadeb 2D is not included. This could
be because only bones were originally documented at this site
(Clark and Kurashina, 1976); however, some lithics were later
reported (Clark and Williams, 1978), so Gadeb 2D might eventually
have been merged with another assemblage.
The oldest assemblage in Locality 2, (and in the whole of the
Gadeb sequence) is Gadeb 2A, embedded in the iron-stained base of
ferruginous gravels near the erosive contact with the Gadeb
Formation diatomite (Fig. 1). Assefa et al. (1982) placed Gadeb 2A
beneath the pumice mudﬂow dated at 1.48 Ma. The next oldest site
is Gadeb 2E, located several hundred metres east of Gadeb 2A, and
contained in a channel ﬁll cutting into the 1.48 Ma pumice mudﬂow
(Clark and Kurashina, 1979a). The Gadeb 2E channel is described as
one ﬁlled with alternating levels of silt, ﬁne sand and clays with
layers of cobbles, rounded angular fragments and archaeological
remains (Clark and Kurashina, 1979a). The channel ﬁll of Gadeb 2C is
higher in the sequence. Here, archaeological material lay on the
weathered tuffs (see Fig. 1) and was overlain by ﬁne sands approximately 1 m thick. Finally, the Gadeb 2B site was stratigraphically
a little higher than Gadeb 2C, but in the same basalt gravels.
The Gadeb 8 outcrop is located only w1 km northeast of Gadeb 2
(Fig. 1). Clark and Williams (1978) distinguished two main cut and ﬁll
stages in Locality 8; an earlier series of gravels and sands that disconformably overlie the diatomite and contains >0.7 Ma old sites,
and an upper part, which corresponds to a later cycle with Middle
Stone Age remains. Desmond Clark excavated four Early Stone Age
sites, most of them probably younger than those at Locality 2
(although see Assefa et al., 1982), but still in reverse polarity sediments (Clark and Kurashina, 1979a). Three of those assemblages
(Gadeb 8A, 8D and 8E) are located in the same channel horizon and
therefore share a similar stratigraphic position, characterized by
gravels and sands resting on an unconformity eroding down the
Pliocene diatomites (Clark and Kurashina, 1979a). These basaltic
gravels and feldspathic sands are capped by a palaeosol and then
a thick layer of pumice sands. The fourth assemblage in Locality 8 is
Gadeb 8F, positioned 4.5 m above Gadeb 8E (Clark, 1987). Gadeb 8F
overlies the palaeosol and is beneath the pumice sands (Williams
et al., 1979), and is the youngest Early Stone Age site in Gadeb.

Site contexts
Table 1 summarizes contextual information and cultural
adscription of the Gadeb 2 and Gadeb 8 sites, according to the
excavators. All of the Gadeb 2 sites (Gadeb 2A, 2B, 2C and 2E) and
Gadeb 8F were originally assigned to the Developed Oldowan B
(sensu Leakey, 1971), whereas Gadeb 8A, 8D and 8E were classiﬁed
as Acheulean (Kurashina, 1978; Clark and Kurashina, 1979a, 1979b).
This general classiﬁcation was maintained in subsequent publications (e.g., Clark, 1980; Kurashina, 1987; but see Assefa et al., 1982),
although the term Developed Oldowan C was eventually favoured
for Gadeb 2E and Gadeb 8F (Clark, 1987).
All assemblages apart from Gadeb 8F (which lay on a paleosol)
belong to stream channel deposits. As mentioned above, most of the
sites were found in cobble and gravel layers, indicating water action
over the assemblages. However, only Gadeb 2A and 8A were
considered sites in secondary position (see Table 1), based on the
index of artefact abrasion (Clark and Kurashina, 1979a). Kurashina
(1978) also noted that Gadeb 2B cannot be considered in primary
position, although the remaining Gadeb assemblages were stated to
be primarily in situ (Clark and Kurashina, 1976, 1979a; Clark and
Williams, 1978; Clark, 1980, 1987). Desmond Clark acknowledged
that although there was some re-sorting of assemblages, in general
the artefacts were in fresh condition. Therefore, it was assumed that
even if the lightest elements had been removed by water action, there
was no signiﬁcant sorting, and archaeological remains in Gadeb 2E,
2C, 2B, 8D, 8E and Gadeb 8F were mainly unaltered (Clark, 1987).
According to recounts by Kurashina (1978) and Clark and
Kurashina (1979a), Gadeb 8E was the largest assemblage, followed by Gadeb 8A, 2E, 2C, 2B, 8D and Gadeb 8F. In terms of artefact
density, Gadeb 8A exceeds 8E, and the third largest concentration is
Gadeb 2C, followed by Gadeb 2B, 2E, 8D and Gadeb 8F (see Table 1).
Kurashina (1978) compared the density of 230.9 lithics per square
metre in Gadeb 8A with 3.4 in Gadeb 8F. However, this should be
viewed with caution; Clark and Kurashina (1979a) noted that the
handaxe concentration in Gadeb 8A is secondary (i.e., accumulated
by water), and the low density of artefacts in Gadeb 8F results from
the merging, in Table 1, of two excavation pits: one of 8  5 m and
a geological trench of 16  2 m (data from Clark, 1987). As stated by
Clark and Kurashina (1979a), artefacts in Gadeb 8F were found in
a discrete concentration spatially associated with a partial hippo
carcass, and therefore the density of artefacts was probably higher
than that shown in Table 1.
Clark and Kurashina (1979a) mentioned the presence of faunal
remains in Gadeb 2A, 2B, 2E, 2C, 8D, 8E and 8F. Although mostly
fragmentary, several bovids, hippo, elephant, zebra and pig were
reported in Gadeb 2E and 8D, and the hippo in Gadeb 8F (Clark and
Kurashina, 1979a). The faunal remains were said to be associated
with the artefacts, but the fragmentary state of the bones and their
low numbers prevented Clark and colleagues from interpreting
further the juxtaposition of fossils and lithics. The exception was

771

Gadeb 8F, which was considered to represent a butchering episode
of a hippopotamus by Developed Oldowan hominins (Clark and
Kurashina, 1979a; Clark, 1987). This single-event activity area at
Gadeb 8F would contrast with the other localities in Gadeb, which
were said to represent “multi-context, multi-component concentrations of high density, most probably reﬂecting regular re-occupation over a longish period of time” (Clark, 1987: 809) on the
banks and channels of shallow streams (Clark and Kurashina,
1979a).
Materials and methods
Apart from Gadeb 2A and Gadeb 25, for which only preliminary
data were presented (Clark and Kurashina, 1979a; Assefa et al.,
1982), there is fairly detailed information on the Gadeb 2 and
Gadeb 8 lithic collections. For example, although no systematic
description of all the Gadeb assemblages has ever been published,
Kurashina’s (1978) Ph.D. dissertation constitutes an invaluable
source for a comprehensive overview of the entire lithic collection.
Additionally, Clark and Kurashina (1976,1979b; Kurashina, 1987)
conducted statistical analyses of artefact typologies, and provided
valuable information on site formation and artefact distribution
(Clark and Kurashina, 1979a; Clark, 1987). However, technological
descriptions of lithics were uncommon in the 1970s, and most of
what is currently known of the Gadeb assemblages corresponds to
typological and metrical domains. Building upon the work of Clark
and Kurashina (Kurashina, 1978; Clark and Kurashina, 1979a), this
review seeks to follow methods of technological analysis to update
our knowledge of the Gadeb lithic collection.
Between 2003 and 2009, several Gadeb assemblages were
analysed in the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa.
Nearly all of the sites excavated by Desmond Clark were found in
the storage facility of the museum, including Gadeb 2A, 2E, 2C, 2B,
8A, 8D, 8E and 8F, and a cursory inspection of all of the collections
was conducted. In the case of Gadeb 2A, given that less than
a dozen pieces were located and that artefact totals had never
been listed, the resulting uncertainty about the character of this
assemblage ruled out a systematic analysis. The other Gadeb 2
sites (Gadeb 2E, 2C and 2B) were selected for in-depth study, as
well as Gadeb 8F and 8D. This selection was made to acquire
a comprehensive understanding of the so-called Developed Oldowan assemblages (Gadeb 2E, 2C, 2B and 8F), which could then be
compared to the Acheulean sites (Gadeb 8D).
Table 2 compares Kurashina’s (1978) original ﬁgures with
recounts taken between 2003 and 2009. As can be seen in this
table, the Gadeb 2B, 2C and 8D collections are reasonably complete,
but a substantial fraction of Gadeb 8F and 2E could not be located in
the storage facility. Much of the Gadeb collection is curated in small
fabric sacks and stored in solid trunks. Many sacks were still sealed
and sewn when the present review was conducted, proving that
they had not been opened since the original 1970s study, so it is

Categories listed follow general technological groups proposed by de la Torre and Mora (2005) and de la Torre et al. (2008). Kurashina’s ﬁgures are adapted as follows:
Kurashina’s modiﬁed cobbles correspond to test cores (sensu de la Torre and Mora, 2005); choppers, polyhedrons, core scrapers, and cores are listed here as cores; handaxes,
cleavers and proto-bifaces are listed as handaxes; Kurashina’s ﬂake scrapers, modiﬁed ﬂakes, modiﬁed ﬂake fragments are merged under the term smaller retouched pieces;
sub-spheroids, spheroids and battered cobbles are listed as percussive tools; ﬂake fragments are listed using the same terminology, i.e., ﬂake fragments; Kurashina’s modiﬁed
chunks, utilized chunks, chunks, and cobble chunks are listed as angular fragments; cobbles and split cobbles are listed as unmodiﬁed material.

unlikely that some artefacts had been intentionally removed and
stored elsewhere. Therefore, in the case of Gadeb 2E and 8F, either
all of the material listed by Kurashina (1978) was not collected and
curated in the museum, or some trunks have yet to be found in the
storage facility.
In order to assess the impact of the missing material on this
study, Kurashina’s (1978) classiﬁcation of lithics was adapted to
more recent proposals of technological categories (de la Torre and
Mora, 2005; de la Torre et al., 2008). Table 2 indicates that
a substantial part of the missing lithics corresponds to clearly
natural (cobbles and split cobbles) or arguably natural material
(test cores, or modiﬁed cobbles in Kurashina’s terminology). This is
the case for a large part of the missing collection in Gadeb 2E, and to
a lesser extent in Gadeb 8F. Therefore, it is feasible that some of the
unmodiﬁed cobbles had not been stored, especially when taking
into account the ﬂuvial contexts from which these assemblages
originated. Whatever the case, Table 2 indicates that the most
informative parts of the Gadeb collections are still accessible. The
present study reviewed a total of 2514 lithics from ﬁve sites,
collectively weighing more than 380 kg, and including about 330
cores, 54 large cutting tools, and several hundreds of ﬂakes and
retouched pieces. Such a collection allows for a detailed technological analysis of the selected assemblages, and constitutes the
dataset of this work.
Kurashina’s (1978) dissertation on the Gadeb assemblages followed the detailed type lists predominant in the 1970s, popularized
by Leakey (1971) in the Olduvai sequence. However, nomenclature
in the present reanalysis follows more recent and synthetic
approaches to Early Stone Age assemblages (e.g., Isaac et al., 1997),
as updated by de la Torre and Mora (2005). Given the focus on
technological features, this study heavily relies on the use of diachritic schemes (Dauvois, 1976) to reconstruct reduction sequences
of ﬂakes, cores and shaped artefacts.
A preliminary study of raw materials was conducted by the
original analysts (Kurashina, 1978; Clark and Kurashina, 1979a),
but no systematic attempt was made to petrologically characterize the Gadeb lithics. The lithofacies characterization of the
Gadeb stratigraphic sequence (Assefa et al., 1982) indicates that
the gravel and conglomerates typical of the Mio Goro Formation
consisted mainly of clasts and pebbles of tuff, pumice, rhyolite,
trachyte and basalt. It can be assumed that most of the raw
materials, mainly trachytes and basalts, used by Gadeb knappers
derive from local river conglomerates. Possible exceptions
include some handaxes made of ignimbrite from outcrops

situated 6 km to the south and west (Assefa et al., 1982), and some
chert and obsidian bifaces in Gadeb 8E, the latter purportedly
obtained from a source 100 km away (Clark and Kurashina,
1979a). The only other pattern observed was the consistent
larger size of ignimbrite handaxes with respect to local lava
examples (Clark and Kurashina, 1979a). Therefore, given the lack
of more in-depth petrological results, in this study all the lava raw
materials are considered together and discussion will focus on
their technological attributes.
Cores are particularly informative in the assessment of knapping
methods and techniques, and therefore detailed descriptions of
reduction systems are required. de la Torre et al. (2003) proposed
a classiﬁcation based on the consideration of cores as geometric
volumes with six ideal planes. Flaking on these planes and the
interaction between them results in unifacial, bifacial, trifacial or
multifacial combinations. The angle formed by the intersection of
the worked planes can be simple (<45 ) or abrupt (>45 ). According
to the directionality of ﬂaking, de la Torre et al. (2003) distinguished
between unipolar, bipolar and centripetal patterns. However, this is
inaccurate; knapping techniques include, among others, free-hand,
throwing, and bipolar. The latter may lead to confusion when some
authors indiscriminately use the term bipolar to refer both to
a particular knapping technique and to the directionality of ﬂaking.
Here, it is proposed that the term bipolar must be reserved for
knapping techniques involving a core resting on an anvil. From this
perspective, it is inaccurate to refer to unipolar or bipolar ﬂaking
directionality, and it is more precise to distinguish between unidirectional or bidirectional ﬂaking patterns. Variability observed in the
Olduvai assemblages also led to the differentiation between
centripetal and peripheral ﬂaking (de la Torre and Mora, 2005). This
differentiation is relevant, as centripetal ﬂaking entails the
management of the central volume of surfaces, whereas peripheral
schemes only affect the edge of surfaces causing the loss of suitable
knapping angles in the centre of volumes.
It must be acknowledged that neither the original proposal of
knapping methods (de la Torre et al., 2003) nor the extended
version (de la Torre and Mora, 2005) include the whole panoply of
knapping systems recognised in Early Stone Age assemblages.
However, variability of methods is such that a synthetic and
reductive perspective must be adopted if intra and inter-assemblage comparisons are to be made. These schemes are based on the
variability observed in Peninj (de la Torre et al., 2003), Olduvai
(de la Torre and Mora, 2005), and Gadeb (the present study), but
certainly do not claim to record all of the techno-typological

variability of ESA exploitation strategies. Therefore, schemes presented in Fig. 2, which update previous proposals (de la Torre et al.,
2003; de la Torre and Mora, 2005) must be considered as ideal
schemes of six surfaces with a number of simple or abrupt unifacial,
bifacial, trifacial or multifacial surface interactions, which at the
same time can show unidirectional, bidirectional, peripheral or
centripetal ﬂaking patterns. Based on these methodological
premises, a technological analysis of the Gadeb assemblages is
presented in the following sections.

The integrity of the Gadeb sites
Clark (e.g., Clark and Kurashina, 1976, 1979a; Clark, 1980, 1987)
asserted that most of the Gadeb assemblages were primarily in situ,
even if some minor re-sorting of the remains had occurred.
Therefore, with the exception of Gadeb 2A and 8A (Clark and
Kurashina, 1979a), not considered here, and perhaps Gadeb 2B
(Kurashina, 1978), most sites were regarded as in primary position.
This was based primarily on low abrasion indices and absence of
preferred orientation of artefacts. Whereas the latter is difﬁcult to
test due to the lack of published quantitative information, (we have
some data only for Gadeb 8A (Clark and Williams, 1978), more
detailed statistics on abrasion are presented in SOM Fig. 1. Gadeb 8F
and 2E show high percentages of fresh artefacts (68.4% and 62.5%
respectively), whereas non-abraded percentages in Gadeb 2C
(8.9%), 8D (4.4%) and 2B (3.5%) are minimal. The highest ratios of
abraded and heavily abraded artefacts appear in Gadeb 2B (45.0%
and 9.7% respectively), Gadeb 2C (37.8% and 21.1%) and Gadeb 8D
(50.0% and 13.3%). Gadeb 8F has only 9.0% of abraded artefacts and

Figure 2. Idealized schemes of free-hand core reduction (expanded from de la Torre
et al., 2003; de la Torre and Mora, 2005). USP: Unifacial simple partial exploitation.
Flaking is unidirectional and restricted to one plane, from a natural striking platform,
and the angle between the striking platform and the knapping surface is simple
(<45 ). Classic choppers fall into this category. BSP: Bifacial simple partial exploitation.
Flaking is unidirectional but in two adjacent surfaces, separated by a simple-angled
bifacial edge. Chopping tools or bifacial choppers (Leakey, 1971) fall into this category.
UAU1: Unidirectional abrupt unifacial exploitation on one knapping surface: Flaking is

unidirectional and limited to one surface, and the angle between the striking platform
and the knapping surface is abrupt (>45 ). Many of Leakey’s (1971) heavy-duty
scrapers fall into this category. UAU2: Unidirectional abrupt unifacial exploitation on
two independent knapping surfaces: although there are two exploitation planes, there
is no interaction between their respective striking platforms and knapping surfaces.
Flaking is unidirectional, and the angle between the striking platform and the knapping surface is abrupt. UAUT: Unifacial abrupt unidirectional total exploitation. There is
only one striking platform, an abrupt angle of interaction between the striking and
knapping surfaces, and ﬂaking takes place all over transversal and sagittal planes of the
core. UABI: Unifacial abrupt bidirectional exploitation: Two opposed striking platforms
are used to ﬂake the same knapping surface, but there is no exchange between the
striking and the knapping surfaces (hence unifacial). BAP: bifacial abrupt partial
exploitation. Flaking takes place in two adjacent surfaces separated by an abrupt angle,
and the volume is exploited partially (i.e., some planes remain unworked). Some of
Leakey’s (1971) heavy-duty scrapers fall into this category. BALP: bifacial alternating
partial exploitation. Two adjacent surfaces are partially knapped by means of alternate
ﬂaking, using scars on the knapping surface of one plane as the striking platform for
obtaining ﬂakes on the other plane. BALT: bifacial alternating total exploitation. The
whole circumference of the core is exploited following the same bifacial alternating
strategy as in the previous method. UP: Unifacial peripheral exploitation. The horizontal plane is exploited unifacially through the rotation of the transversal and sagittal
planes, but extractions do not meet in the centre of the volume and reduction is
limited to the edge of the core. BP: bifacial peripheral. Exploitation concentrates on the
horizontal plane but there are two interactive surfaces, with the transversal and
sagittal planes sometimes acting as preparation striking platforms for extractions on
the horizontal plane. UC: Unifacial centripetal exploitation. The horizontal plane is
exploited unifacially through the rotation of the transversal and sagittal planes, and
extractions are radial and usually meet towards the centre of the knapping surface,
facilitating the reduction of the volume. BHC: Bifacial hierarchical centripetal. An
intersection plane divides the core into two asymmetrical and hierarchized volumes.
Transversal and saggital planes act as a subordinated volume (preparation surface) to
obtain ﬂakes in the main exploitation surface (see full discussion of this method and its
implications in de la Torre, 2009). Discoid: this method, widely known in the Middle
Palaeolithic literature (see Boëda, 1993; Peresani, 2003), is similar to the BHC, except
for the unclear hierarchization of surfaces and the systematic alternating of strikes on
the bifacial edge. Polyhedral: cores with three or more knapping surfaces, which
become spherical, whether intentional (Texier and Roche, 1995) or the unplanned
result of continued reduction sequences (Schick and Toth, 1994). Multifacial: cores
with three or more knapping surfaces which show no clear organization of ﬂaking but
the irregular use of any available ﬂaking angles.

no heavily abraded pieces, and both indices are equally low in
Gadeb 2E (5.7% and 2.4%, respectively). Therefore, the abrasion
index suggests greater disturbance than previously proposed,
particularly in sites such as Gadeb 2B, 2C and 8D, where artefacts
may have been heavily affected by water.
Artefact size curves (e.g., Schick, 1984) are another useful
proxy to evaluate water disturbance. However, as Kurashina
(1978) states that sediments from the Gadeb sites were not
sieved, the minute fraction of lithic assemblages is not available.
In fact, not a single piece of debris was found in the present
review, and very few of the measured artefacts (n ¼ 7 out of 2514)
measured less than 20 mm. Kurashina (1978) indicates that
sieving was unnecessary given the coarse size of deposits, so it
may be assumed that minute pieces of debris simply were not
there to be recovered. The question then is whether the lithics of
<20 mm, indicative of in situ knapping activities, were sorted
away by ﬂuvial processes whereas larger artefacts remained in
primary position, as Clark (e.g., Clark and Kurashina, 1979a; Clark,
1980, 1987) suggested, or whether the entire assemblages were
rearranged and accumulated secondarily.
Intra-assemblage category ratios can also aid in assessing the
integrity of collections. Although tool-maker decisions do bias the
ratio of artefact categories preserved at sites, extensive experimental work (e.g., Toth, 1982; Schick, 1984) demonstrates that
there are expected proportions of ﬂaked and detached pieces
(sensu Isaac, 1986), and that the latter usually outnumber core
forms at in situ assemblages (de la Torre and Mora, 2005). SOM
Fig. 1 illustrates this point, and highlights the deﬁcit of detached
pieces in Gadeb 8D and 8F. Although this paucity is more apparent
in Gadeb 8D and 8F, it can also be extrapolated to other assemblages. For example, the ﬂake: core ratio (considered here as the
sum of ﬂakes and ﬂake fragments divided by the number of cores)
yields a ratio of only 2.4 ﬂakes per core in Gadeb 2E, and 2.6 ﬂakes
per core in Gadeb 2B, while recounts of the number of scars on
cores show that cores were considerably more reduced (see
below). Therefore, it can be stated that, in general, Gadeb
assemblages contain substantially less detached materials than
should be expected.
Finally, site contexts and other remains purportedly associated
with stone tools must be considered when discussing the integrity of
the Gadeb lithic assemblages. For example, questions arise about the
relationship between the unmodiﬁed lithics and knapped artefacts.
According to Kurashina’s (1978) recounts (see Table 2), unmodiﬁed
blocks outnumbered all (Gadeb 2E) or nearly all (Gadeb 8F) other
lithic categories in some assemblages. Due to the storage procedures
mentioned above, it is likely that ﬁgures for unmodiﬁed material in
this paper are underrepresented with respect to the original estimates. Despite this, Table 3 shows that unmodiﬁed lithics, in the form
of complete and fragmented blocks and cobbles, still represent
a signiﬁcant part of the Gadeb collections, especially in assemblages

like Gadeb 2E, 2C and 8F, where dozens of kilograms correspond to
natural rocks. Taking into consideration the ﬂuvial environment in
which these sites are located and the conglomerate character of this
part of the sequence (Assefa et al., 1982), it is difﬁcult to consider
as archaeological in origin the unmodiﬁed rocks, which often
outnumber the knapped/pounded artefacts, especially in high energy
contexts where natural cobbles are common.
Questions about site integrity also arise with regards to the
contextual links between lithics and bones. As mentioned above,
Clark and Kurashina (1979a) were prudent when assessing possible
contextual relationships between the lithic assemblages and fossils,
due to the poor preservation and fragmentary nature of the bones.
They proposed Gadeb 8F as the only clear evidence for an association between fossils and lithics, and considered the assemblage as
a hippo butchery site (Clark and Kurashina, 1979a; Clark, 1987). This
was based on the presence of several hippo bones (according to
Kurashina (1978): three tusks, one left scapula and one rib) that
could correspond to a partial skeleton, and on the spatial association with the lithics, as the “scapula, long bone and rib fragments
lay together with two sub-spheroids and a spheroid which had
been used to break up the bones to get at the marrow” (Assefa et al.,
1982: 42). Nevertheless, we must bear in mind that Kurashina
(1978) only reported 20 bone remains (the aforementioned hippo
bones, as well as a bovid tooth and another of Equus). Also, although
Gadeb 8F is the only site of the sequence deposited in a low energy
environment (a paleosol) and with lithics mostly showing fresh
edges (see SOM Fig. 1), smaller stone tool categories are clearly
underrepresented (Table 2), suggesting that even this assemblage
experienced some winnowing. This pattern, together with the
fragmentary and weathered character of the preserved bones (pers.
obs.), precludes a conclusive account for Gadeb 8F, and, in this case
too, might question the putative association between the stone and
bone assemblage.
There are several lines of evidence suggesting that the integrity of Gadeb assemblages has been seriously affected by natural
processes. A reconsideration of abrasion indices (SOM Fig. 1)
indicates that, except for Gadeb 8F and to a lesser extent Gadeb 2E,
all of the studied assemblages contain signiﬁcant numbers of
abraded material. Artefact size patterns (Table 4) also clearly show
the absence of small fraction lithics in all sites, and category ratios
(SOM Fig. 1) indicate fragmentation of the chaîne opératoire and
overrepresentation of large artefacts. Added to the coarse matrix
of deposits (e.g., Assefa et al., 1982) and the probable spurious
relationship between artefacts, unmodiﬁed rocks and fragmented
fossils, it becomes clear that most, if not all, of the Gadeb
assemblages are the result of ﬂuvial dynamics that have mixed
elements with different depositional histories. Despite this, the
Gadeb assemblages correspond to stratigraphically-controlled
contexts, which allow the systematic technological appraisal
presented below.

Results
The Gadeb 2E assemblage
The lithic collection of Gadeb 2E studied at the National Museum
of Ethiopia consists of 761 lithics (see Table 2). 7.2% (n ¼ 55) are
unmodiﬁed cobbles/blocks, which alongside angular fragments
(16.6%, n ¼ 126) were removed from further analysis due to their
probable natural origin. The resulting percentages (Fig. 3) indicate
the predominance of detached pieces (ﬂakes, ﬂake fragments and
small retouched pieces) against ﬂaked/pounded artefacts (cores and
percussive tools). This preponderance refers only to the number of
items, but the overall weight of each category (Table 3) demonstrates
that cores and percussive tools are substantially more relevant, at
least in terms of raw material expenditure. In fact, even when
considering only frequencies of items, there is an imbalance between
ﬂaked/pounded artefacts and detached elements. The ﬂake/core
ratio (2.4) is proportionally low, particularly when taking into
account that Gadeb 2E cores have an average of 8.7 ﬂake scars per
core. Thus, there is an acute shortage of some artefacts in the
assemblage, especially of the smallest fraction and the debitage,
which must be attributed to taphonomic causes.
Although the average ﬂake size is nearly 5 cm (Table 4), there are
two neatly different chaînes opératoires within the ﬂake population,
one related to the ﬂaking of small debitage (SOM Fig. 2) and the
other to the production of large cutting tools (SOM Fig. 3). Fig. 4A
shows that alongside ﬂakes of <6 cm (86,6% of the sample), there
are several larger ones (n ¼ 38, some weighing over a kilogram) that
could have served as blanks for the production of large cutting tools
(LCTs). Therefore, even if most ﬂakes are patterned within the 4 to
6 cm length module typical of small debitage systems, Gadeb 2E also
contains ﬂakes that belong to a different chaîne opératoire, that of
LCT production, whose attribution would remain undetectable if
only size means were presented.
52.5% of the ﬂakes display no cortex on the dorsal and platform
surfaces (Fig. 4C), and have an average of 2.89 previous scars, higher
than in any other site in Gadeb (see also Fig. 4D). Although striking
platforms are rarely prepared (only 3.8% of butts are bifaceted and
none are multifaceted), most ﬂakes (87.3%) were struck from
decorticated platforms, which indicate bifacial rotation of cores
(Fig. 4B). Dorsal scar patterns of ﬂakes support this observation.
SOM Fig. 4 shows that bifacial interchange of core surfaces was
accompanied by extensive rotation of each surface. Although
centripetal ﬂakes are not the most abundant, they coexist in Gadeb

2E with unidirectional and predominantly cortical products typical
of more static ﬂaking methods (Fig. 5).
The number of cores in Gadeb 2E (n ¼ 124) is remarkably high,
forming 21.4% of the items in Fig. 3. Whereas some of the ﬂakes are
rolled, the cores are generally in fresh condition, suggesting that this
component of the assemblage was not sorted or dragged from
upstream occupations. There is great size variability (Table 3 and
Fig. 6A), ranging from tiny cores of less than 4 cm to those larger than
15 cm in length and weighing over 2 kg. However, despite this size
variability (Fig. 7 and SOM Fig. 5), the Gadeb 2E cores all belong to
the small debitage chaîne opératoire. Even the largest cores available
in the collection were not big enough to produce the large LCT blanks
present at the site, which were likely transported from elsewhere.
Most of the cores seem to have been made from cobbles
immediately available in the local streams and they usually
preserve large cortical surfaces (Fig. 6C and D). However, there is no
clear pattern in reduction intensity. Given the local availability of
raw material, it might be expected that most cores were little
reduced (see examples from SOM Fig. 6). However, that is not the
case. Fig. 6B shows that a substantial part (61.9%) of the Gadeb 2E
cores have more than 6 ﬂake scars, the majority of those with more
than 10 negatives. Here, the number of core scars can tentatively be
used as a proxy to address reduction intensity, which if considered
with the size variability mentioned above, produces an inconclusive pattern; one in which large-sized local lava cobbles were
sometimes abandoned after a few removals, whereas others were
heavily reduced and difﬁcult to manipulate small cores (SOM Fig. 7)
that were discarded following longer reduction process.
Thus in Gadeb 2E, there is coexistence between minimally
reduced cores (which preserve most of the original cortex, weigh
up to 2 kg and have only a few extractions, and intensively
exploited cores whose reduced cortical surfaces), minimal size, and
high scar numbers indicate long knapping processes, to a stage
where ﬂaking was hardly viable. Some of the cases in SOM Fig. 7
and Fig. 8 illustrate this point, as they show how difﬁcult it
would be in terms of handling mechanics to continue knapping.
The study of knapping methods also yields interesting results.
Bifacial systems (BSP, BALP, BALT, BP, BHC and DISC) account for
55.1% of cores demonstrating frequent exchange of knapping
surfaces as opposed to strategies based on exploitation of single
surfaces. Fig. 9 indicates that the interaction of surfaces was complemented with frequent rotation of volumes. Thus, radial
management of surfaces (UP, BP, BHC, DISC) is observed in 33.9% of
cores (see also Table 5). Many radial cores correspond to methods

where core volumes are not fully managed (UP and BP, n ¼ 25), but
there are also examples of well-structured exploitation sequences
(BHC and DISC, n ¼ 12).
Bifacial hierarchical centripetal methods appear in several
stages of reduction, from large cores abandoned in the early
phases of exploitation, to very small cores that seem to have
undergone long reduction processes (Fig. 10). Application of these

methods allow the knapper to obtain several ﬂaking sets by the
continuing rejuvenation of surfaces and volumes (Boëda, 1994;
Lenoir and Turq, 1995; Peresani, 2003; de la Torre, 2009), and
therefore to extend substantially the utility of cores. It could then
be stated that these cores represent the existence of ﬁxed mental
templates that led knappers to apply some particular ﬂaking
methods regardless of blank size, until cores were intensively

exhausted. Nevertheless, the utility of small ﬂakes such as those
detached from some of the cores shown in Figs. 8 and 10 remains
unclear.
Despite the long use life of some Gadeb 2E cores, it must also
be recognised that most cores show shorter reduction sequences
and rather unstructured knapping methods. Thus, many cores are
remarkably expedient, where cortical surfaces or natural fracture
planes are normally used as knapping platforms, and there is
limited rotation of volume (SOM Figs. 6. 8, and 9). The abrupt
angle formed by the interaction between knapping and striking
surfaces hinders the attainment of long production sets, so that
cores had to be abandoned after a few ﬂake removals due to the
loss of suitable angles. Therefore, the coexistence of structured
and expedient reduction methods is an important element of
the small debitage chaîne opératoire in Gadeb 2E, and should be
considered when evaluating overall characteristics of the
assemblage.
Questions arise when analysing retouched lithics, given the
post-depositional processes that affected all of the Gadeb assemblages and which could cause pseudo-retouch on the edge of

pieces. Although this paper has adopted a conservative approach to
the analysis of retouch, retouched lithics are unambiguously
present in all the sites studied. Thus, although the percentage is
low, especially when compared to nearby sites like Gadeb 2B (see
Fig. 3), the small debitage chaîne opératoire at Gadeb 2E includes
some retouched pieces (n ¼ 17). Retouch is unsystematic, usually
denticulated, unifacial, and does not seem to follow standardized
shapes (Fig. 11). In general, small retouched pieces can be classiﬁed
as sidescrapers and denticulates, but they are rare in the assemblage and do not seem to have been the main objective of knapping
activities in Gadeb 2E.
Alongside these diminutive (approximately 4e5 cm) retouched
pieces, there are several other tools in Gadeb 2E that are small
enough to have been struck from cores corresponding to the small
debitage chaîne opératoire, but which show traits that resemble the
shaped tools typical of the LCT operational sequence. Thus,
retouched pieces from Fig. 12 are larger (w6-10 cm) and above all,
seem to represent the aim of producing pointed shapes, sometimes
through bifacial and bilateral retouch, which could in some
instances (e.g., Fig. 12, #2 and 3) be considered as handaxes.

Figure 5. Examples of small debitage products attributed to unidirectional and radial systems in Gadeb 2E.

Although a continuum can be traced in the size ranges of
retouched tools, in Gadeb 2E there is also a break between the small
debitage chaîne opératoire and that of LCTs. As mentioned above,
there are no LCT cores in the assemblage. Also lacking are most of the
products (large ﬂake fragments and chunks, etc.), that would be
expected should the production of LCTs have taken place on site.
Nevertheless, some large ﬂakes (>10 cm) demonstrate that LCT
technology occurred in Gadeb 2E. Considering Clark and Kurashina’s
(1979a) estimation that the nearest ignimbrite source is 6 km away,
then piece number 1 in Fig. 13 shows that hominins ﬂaked and
transported massive blanks (either retouched or unformatted) to the
site from distant locations. More importantly, these examples indicate that different ﬂaking techniques were known to Gadeb 2E
knappers. The production of the ﬂakes and LCTs in Fig. 13 could have
required the use of dormant percussors or static boulder cores, as
opposed to the free-hand ﬂaking methods used in the small debitage
chaîne opératoire.
Finally, the relevance of percussive activities in Gadeb 2E must
be stressed. Kurashina (1978) mentioned the presence of abundant battered cobbles, as well as sub-spheroids and spheroids.
This reanalysis has conﬁrmed that battered tools (n ¼ 122) make
up a substantial part of the assemblage, about 21% of the pieces, if
unmodiﬁed cobbles and angular fragments are excluded (Fig. 3).

In fact, the total weight of battered artefacts (w81 kg) is the
highest of the assemblage (Table 3) and conﬁrms that percussive
activities were a relevant activity at Gadeb 2E. The most abundant
percussive artefacts are hammerstones with fracture angles
(sensu Mora and de la Torre, 2005). These tools (n ¼ 56) account to
45.9% of battered artefacts, and outnumber regular ﬂaking hammerstones (42.6%) and anvils (11.5%). In Gadeb 2E, some hammerstones with fracture angles show extremely heavily battered
ridges, and could be related to activities other than knapping, as
argued elsewhere (de la Torre and Mora, 2005). Unfortunately,
the poor resolution of the archaeological context makes it difﬁcult
to assess the relationship of battered tools with other elements of
the assemblage, and further discuss the functional meaning of
these artefacts.
The Gadeb 2C assemblage
This study reviewed 561 lithics in Gadeb 2C, a ﬁgure close to
Kurashina’s (1978) original recount (n ¼ 622). However, the
breakdown of categories (Table 2) diverge substantially, as many of
the lithics originally classiﬁed as ﬂakes, cores and others, are here
considered as pieces with natural fractures. It is important to recall
the large degree of disturbance at this site. Most of the material

(58.9%) is abraded or severely abraded, and only 8.9% shows no
abrasion (SOM Fig. 1). This high degree of abrasion, alongside the
coarse sedimentary context and absence of small lithics, indicates
considerable energetic water ﬂows that mixed archaeological and
naturally fractured items.
Once ambiguously archaeological (angular fragments) and
clearly natural material (unmodiﬁed blocks) are excluded from the
analysis, the Gadeb 2C collection is substantially reduced to only
178 artefacts (Fig. 3). Flakes (28.1%) and ﬂake fragments (51.1%)
predominate, although there is proportional deﬁcit of debitage. The
ﬂake/core ratio is 5.6, hence higher than in Gadeb 2E, but still lower
than expected. In fact, as there is an average of seven scars per core
in Gadeb 2C, the number of ﬂakes found at the site should have
been substantially higher, further reinforcing the notion of disturbance and winnowing of the assemblage.
The ﬂakes average approximately 4 cm in length (Table 4), most
clustering in the 2 to 4 cm size range, with only a few showing
larger size patterns (Fig. 4A). Thus, nearly all ﬂakes can be assigned
to the small debitage chaîne opératoire. Flake striking platforms are
mostly unifaceted (87.2%), with only marginal presence of bifaceted
or cortical butts (Fig. 4B). In contrast with other assemblages, Gadeb
2C ﬂakes show low percentages of cortex (Fig. 4C). 68.1% of the
ﬂakes have no cortex, whereas completely cortical products are
almost non-existent (n ¼ 1, 2.1%). Equally, Gadeb 2C ﬂakes show
higher percentages of dorsal surface scars (3e4 scars) than in other
assemblages (Fig. 4D), which also suggest more intense reduction
sequences. Direction of ﬂaking deduced from the scars on ﬂakes
indicates predominantly unidirectional knapping methods, in
which there was little rotation of ﬂaking surfaces (SOM Fig. 10).
Data derived from the cores (n ¼ 25) only partially supports
patterns shown by the ﬂakes. For example, all cores show some
cortex, whereas indices of non-cortical ﬂakes in Gadeb 2C are

particularly high. Gadeb 2C cores are primarily made on cobbles
(Fig. 6D), have a mean length of nearly 8 cm (Table 4) and show
lower scar averages than Gadeb 2E (Fig. 6B). The predominance of
cortical surfaces and low scar indices indicate short reduction
sequences, in which local cobbles of <10 cm length and w500 g
(Table 4) were selected as cores and abandoned after a few ﬂakes
had been removed.
The reduction methods in Gadeb 2C are consistent with the
quantitative parameters outlined above. Fig. 9 and Table 5 show
that unifacial systems (USP, UAU1, UAU2, UAUT, UP) predominate
over bifacial methods (BSP, BAP, BALT, BP). None of these methods
are very effective in the execution of long reduction sequences, as
maintenance of suitable angles becomes difﬁcult due to inefﬁcient
management of volume. In general, the Gadeb 2C cores indicate
little rotation of knapping surfaces, which supports ﬂake scar
patterns. Both ﬂakes (SOM Fig. 10) and cores (SOM Fig. 11) indicate
unidirectional exploitation systems, in which once the knapping
angles become too obtuse, the cores are discarded rather than
rejuvenated through a change of ﬂaking surface or rotation of the
same surface. In those cases where interaction of ﬂaking surfaces
occurs, there is either little rotation of cores (e.g., BSP, BAP), or the
central volume of ﬂaking surfaces is not exploited (BALT, BP). It can
thus be stated that the small core and ﬂake technology in Gadeb 2C
(Fig. 14) shows rather expedient exploitation methods, where
reduction sequences are usually short, cores are poorly structured
and abandoned after the production of a few ﬂakes.
Small retouched artefacts are scarce in Gadeb 2C (n ¼ 8),
although percentage-wise they are more abundant than in Gadeb
2E. They are all denticulates on ﬂakes and ﬂake fragments, with
unsystematic modiﬁcation of edges and absence of standardized
forms. Many of the pieces originally classiﬁed as shaped tools
(Kurashina, 1978) exhibit pseudo-retouch, and it cannot be ruled

780

out that the percentage of naturally denticulated pieces was even
higher, although difﬁcult to ascertain due to the general abraded
state of the assemblage. Pieces # 4 and #5 in Fig. 14 are typical
examples of this pattern, with w5 cm ﬂake blanks deemed as
retouched in which edges were marginally modiﬁed forming
notches and denticulates.
Some pieces, such as Fig. 14 #6, do not entirely ﬁt within the
small debitage chaîne opératoire, for the retouch is on larger ﬂake
blanks. However, these are morphologically similar to the small
retouched tools, in which denticulated edge modiﬁcation is irregular and does not seem to impose any particular shape. As is the
case for Gadeb 2E, the intermediate retouched pieces in Gadeb 2C
probably relate to the LTC chaîne opératoire. In the Gadeb 2C
assemblage, the LCT reduction sequence is only clearly represented
by three pieces, but they are indisputably evidence of large ﬂake
production and handaxe shaping. Fig. 15 illustrates two of these
examples. Neither show successful management of the central
volume, with simple angled rather than plain retouch, making it

difﬁcult to overcome step and hinge fractures. Nevertheless,
Fig. 15#1 displays a clear aim to work the two surfaces through
a bifacial edge in order to obtain a roughly balanced symmetrical
proﬁle. On the other hand, Fig. 15#2 is a w1.3 kg ﬂake obtained by
the splitting of a large core, and which was subsequently retouched
unifacially on both edges in order to get a trihedral point. Hence,
these pieces prove the presence in Gadeb 2C of LCT elements,
alongside the more common items associated with the small debitage chaîne opératoire.
The Gadeb 2B assemblage
The Gadeb 2B assemblage reviewed in this paper consists of 580
pieces, a ﬁgure almost identical to Kurashina’s (1978) original
number (n ¼ 589). The breakdown of categories (Table 2) is also
similar to Kurashina’s, although there is divergence in the totals of
small retouched pieces, which are higher in this review. Abrasion
indices (SOM Fig. 1) indicate that nearly all of the assemblage

(96.5%) shows some rounding, with 54.7% of pieces being abraded
or very abraded. Therefore, it is clear that sorting occurred and that
the breakdown of categories does not reﬂect the original composition of the assemblage. Nevertheless, after removing angular
fragments and natural blocks from the analysis, there still remains
a fairly large collection (n ¼ 364 artefacts), including a high number
of cores and retouched pieces that provide relevant technological
data.
With an average length of approximately 5 cm (Table 4), most
ﬂakes belong to the small debitage chaîne opératoire. However,
there are several larger ﬂakes (some greater than 10 cm and 400 g),
which certainly do not correspond to the small core and ﬂake
reduction sequence but rather to that of LCTs. Flake striking platforms are usually unifaceted (61.9%), although cortical butts (20.6%)
are also relatively abundant. However, the percentage of dihedral
striking platforms (12.7%) in Gadeb 2B is the highest of all Gadeb
assemblages, and this is also the only site where multifaceted butts
were reported (see Fig. 4B). Most ﬂakes (45.6%) show no cortex,
whereas only 3.5% are completely cortical. On the other hand, the
mean scar count on the ﬂakes (2.27) is lower than in other
assemblages such as Gadeb 2E and 2C, while only a few ﬂakes
(29.1%) display more than two previous scars on their dorsal faces
(Fig. 4D). The direction of previous negative scars on the ﬂakes
(Fig. 16) indicates unidirectional methods and rare rotation of
knapping surfaces. Despite this pattern, the percentage of edgecore ﬂakes (13.4% of the whole ﬂake sample) is fairly high, which
implies rotation of knapping surfaces (SOM Fig. 12). Nonetheless,
these edge-core ﬂakes seem to be the result more of a search for
new angles, rather than rejuvenation pieces from the rearrangement of ﬂaking and striking surfaces.
The entire core sample in Gadeb 2B can be attributed to the
small debitage chaîne opératoire. The average core length is 5.6 cm,
smaller than in any other Gadeb site (Table 4). In fact, nearly half of
the cores (44.8%) are under 5 cm, and only one (1.5%) is larger than
10 cm (Fig. 6A). This size pattern may also explain the low core scar
index (mean ¼ 5.44 negatives per core), the lowest alongside Gadeb
8D (see also Fig. 6B). Most cores (84.2%) retain cortex, and 31.6% are
predominantly cortical (Fig. 6C), so small core size can be explained
by selection of small cobbles (Fig. 6D) rather than by intensive
reduction processes of larger blanks. On the other hand, in Gadeb
2B several cores are made on ﬂakes (n ¼ four; 6.3%), which is rare in
other assemblages and also contributes towards the generally
reduced dimensions of cores at the site.

Despite the small blank size, Gadeb 2B knappers frequently
conducted bifacial reduction of cores, which also included rotation
of ﬂaking surfaces (Fig. 17). Fig. 9 and Table 5 show that interaction
of two debitage planes (BSP, BAP, BALT, BP) occurred in 57.8% of
cores, and that full rotation of ﬂaking surfaces (BALT, UP, BP) was
also relatively frequent (28.1%). Nevertheless, despite the precision
required to obtain ﬂakes from such tiny blanks (see Fig. 17),
knapping methods in Gadeb 2B are rather simple or unstructured.
For instance, 12.5% of the cores show no maintenance of stable
knapping and exploitation surfaces (multifacial cores), and there
are no examples where the central volume was successfully
managed (i.e., discoid and BHC methods). In general, only the
peripheral volume close to the core edge was reduced, leading to
rapid loss of suitable angles. This edge was dealt with through
abrupt and simple angled ﬂaking, and also through alternation of
ﬂaking and striking surfaces. In fact, consecutive exchange of
platforms (BALP and BALT) is particularly common in Gadeb 2B,
especially among the smallest cores (Fig. 17).
Many of the small retouched pieces have fresh edges, so it is
unlikely that retouch was produced by post-depositional processes,
such as trampling. If the intentional retouching of these pieces is
accepted, then Gadeb 2B yields the largest percent of small
retouched artefacts of the ﬁve sites studied. As shown in Table 2 and
Fig. 3, the number of small retouched pieces is almost equal to that
of ﬂakes, making up a signiﬁcant percentage (16.8%) of the
assemblage. With an average length of 4.6 cm (see Table 4), these
retouched pieces are signiﬁcantly smaller than in the other Gadeb
assemblages and are generally more carefully shaped.
The high number of small retouched ﬂakes (n ¼ 61) in Gadeb
2B permits a closer examination of their main characteristics. For
example, there is clear preference for the choice of whole ﬂakes
(60.7%) versus ﬂake fragments (37.7%) or small pebbles (1.6%),
as blanks to be retouched. However, given the similar metrics
between ﬂakes (mean length ¼ 44.8 mm; mean weight ¼ 38.6 g)
and small retouched pieces (mean length ¼ 46.3 mm; mean
weight ¼ 36.5 g), the intentional selection of blanks according to
size for retouch cannot be stated categorically. Typologically, the
Gadeb 2B small retouched pieces are not unlike those in other
assemblages, most being notches and denticulated sidescrapers
(Fig. 18). However, retouch is often less marginal and more
continuous along the edges of pieces. In fact, a few pieces show
retouch which shapes a tip (e.g., Fig. 18, #1, 5 & 7), and therefore
may be indicative of a pattern to produce pointed forms.

Finally, Gadeb 2B shows elements typical of the LCT chaîne
opératoire. This reduction sequence is represented by some large
unretouched ﬂakes and also shaped LCTs (Fig. 19). Although
numerically these LCTs are not abundant (n ¼ 4), they provide

valuable data on the knapping strategies involving ﬂaking and
shaping large forms. Fig. 19 #2, 3 and 4 shows that large cores were
prepared to produce heavy-duty ﬂakes, which in some instances
were also shaped. However, Fig. 19 #1 shows that cobbles were also

used as LCT blanks. Fig. 19 #5 could represent either a shaped
cobble or (most likely) a split cobble that was shaped into a point,
perhaps similar to that seen in Gadeb 2C (Fig. 15#2). Except for the
cleaver (Fig. 19 #3), the aim of all of the Gadeb 2B LCTs seems
directed at obtaining a pointed end. This is probably the only
typological pattern shared by all pieces, which lack any other
standardized pattern. None of the LCTs shows bifacial reduction,
and certainly no symmetrical shaping of volume. Retouch does not
penetrate the blank volume and is restricted to the edges, which are
only marginally modiﬁed. Although all of these pieces are attributed to the LCT chaîne opératoire, none qualiﬁes as a biface.
The Gadeb 8D assemblage
The Gadeb 8D collection discussed in this paper (n ¼ 433) is
similar to Kurashina’s (1978) original recounts (n ¼ 487), so the
assemblage stored at the museum seems to have been preserved
fairly complete (Table 2). Most pieces classiﬁed here as angular
fragments have rolled edges, and are likely to belong to the original
sedimentary matrix. Once these angular fragments and unmodiﬁed
blocks are discounted (Fig. 3), there remains a high percentage of
rounded pieces (SOM Fig. 1A) with 63.3% of artefacts being abraded
or heavily abraded. Winnowing of the assemblage is especially
conspicuous when the percentage of detached elements is examined. As shown in SOM Fig. 1B, debitage is heavily underrepresented in Gadeb 8D. Table 2 illustrates that the sum of ﬂakes and
ﬂake fragment is still lower than the total number of cores. If the
number of scars on cores (with an average of 5.4 extractions per
core, a minimum of 491 ﬂakes is expected) and handaxes (mean of
4.8 scars per piece with an expected minimum of 182 ﬂakes) is
taken into account, under representation of debitage becomes even
more acute. Therefore, the sample bias at Gadeb 8D is signiﬁcant
and must be taken into account when considering links between
different elements of the assemblage.
The technological interpretation of regular ﬂakes is complicated,
not only because of limited numbers. Although the mean size of ﬂakes
(approximately 5 cm) might indicate the small debitage chaîne
opératoire (Table 4), the fact is that many ﬂakes are larger than most
of the cores present at Gadeb 8D. Therefore, it is possible that many
regular ﬂakes belong to LCT preparation or handaxe roughing out.
Striking platform preparation is absent (Fig. 4B) and platforms are
predominantly cortical (65.7%). In fact, 97.1% of ﬂakes preserve cortex
either on the dorsal side and/or butt, and 22.9% are completely

cortical (Fig. 4C). Very few ﬂakes display more than a couple of
previous removals, and none more than four scars (Fig. 4D). The
direction of previous removals (Fig. 16) suggests either unidirectional
methods, or ﬂaking that may convey rotation of surfaces but no
interaction between scars, e.g., as happens in methods where the
central volume is not exploited. The amount of cortex, paucity of
dorsal scars and unidirectional patterns of unmodiﬁed ﬂakes in
Gadeb 8D (SOM Fig. 13) therefore demonstrate non-intensive ﬂaking
of knapping surfaces and short reduction sequences, be they related
to exploitation of either cores or handaxes.
The small debitage chaîne opératoire is well represented in Gadeb
8D by a high number of cores (n ¼ 91). Furthermore, given the
considerable number of test cores (i.e., blocks or cobbles with one to
two scars, which are considered as raw material testing), an argument
could be made for the on site knapping of small cores, but products
are underrepresented due to winnowing of the assemblage. Along
with the cores from Gadeb 2B, those in Gadeb 8D are the smallest of
all sites studied (mean ¼ 64.7 mm), so they clearly correspond to
a chaîne opératoire that is different from that of LCTs. The small core
size is unlikely to be due to intensive blank reduction. Very few cores
are non-cortical (Fig. 6C), and indeed Gadeb 8D cores have the lowest
average scar count (5.43 negatives per core), matched only by Gadeb
2B (mean ¼ 5.44). In sum, Gadeb 8D cores are usually made on small
cobbles (Fig. 6D) that were used to remove a short series of ﬂakes,
after which they were rapidly discarded.
The reduction methods in Gadeb 8D include a panoply of unifacial (USP, UAU1, UAU2, UAUT, UP) and bifacial (BSP, BAP, BALP,
BALT, BP) systems (see Table 5 and Fig. 9). Methods including the
full rotation of exploitation surfaces (BALP, BALT, UP, BP, BHC) are
relatively abundant (36.3%), although central volumes are usually
poorly exploited. Therefore, the small cobble size and poor
management of the central volume led to rapid loss of suitable
angles, even among radial cores (Fig. 20). Nevertheless, exhaustion
of appropriate angles may not explain the low intensity of core
reduction. For example, many cores in SOM Fig. 14 still maintain
optimal volumes that could be exploited without rotation, rejuvenation or surface exchange. They simply were abandoned after
a few detachments, well before the suitable angles were lost.
Small retouched pieces (n ¼ 37 and 15.3%, Fig. 3) are almost as
abundant as whole ﬂakes (n ¼ 38, 15.7%), reaching a percentage
similar to that described above for Gadeb 2B. But whereas in the
latter there was a preference for whole ﬂakes as blanks for small
retouched tools, in Gadeb 8D, 45.9% of retouched pieces were on

ﬂake fragments, followed by ﬂake blanks (35.1%) and small pebbles
(10.9%), with 8.1% of pieces on undeterminable blank types. Small
retouched tool size (mean length ¼ 57.3 mm) is very similar to that
of ﬂakes and ﬂake fragments (mean length ¼ 54.1 mm and
52.9 mm, respectively), so it is unclear whether there was preferential selection of blanks according to size. It should also be
remembered that the average length (w5.5 cm) of both ﬂakes and
small retouched pieces is almost identical to that of cores (see
Table 4), so it may be that they correspond to different reduction
sequences. As in all sites previously described, the small retouched
pieces of Gadeb 8D are usually unifacial denticulates and sidescrapers with no clear typological standardization (Fig. 21).
Nevertheless, as with Gadeb 2B, the edges of these small ﬂakes and
ﬂake fragments seem to be more intensively retouched and in some
instances (e.g., Fig. 21 #4) shaped into bifacial pointed artefacts.
Gadeb 8D has a considerable number of handaxes (n ¼ 38),
which make up 15.7% of the knapped assemblage, the same
percentage as ﬂakes (Fig. 3). Their relevance in the assemblage
composition is even more obvious when looking at their overall
weight contribution (Table 3), in which handaxe total weight
(w20 kg) represents the largest investment of raw material. Most
handaxes have slightly abraded (64.9%) or fresh (2.7%) edges,
whereas only a few are abraded (24.3%) or heavily abraded (5.4%).
Therefore, most Gadeb 8D handaxes probably did not undergo
heavy transportation processes and may have been recovered close
to their original position. In a sample of 26 handaxes, 61.5% were
predominantly cortical (i.e., cortex >50%), including 7.7% with
completely cortical dorsal surfaces. An additional 19.2% show <50%
cortex, and only a few pieces (19.2%) are non-cortical. The high
percentage of cortex suggests non-intensive shaping, which is also
supported by the average scar count (7.41 scars per piece).

Nonetheless, there is a high variability in the intensity of façonnage
(Fig. 22), from pieces with no or very few extractions, to some
handaxes that have up to 22 scars.
Of the whole sample of handaxes (n ¼ 38), 51.4% are on ﬂakes
and 29.7% on cobbles. The remaining 18.9% are handaxes where
shaping was so intensive as to make it difﬁcult to ascertain the
original blank. With an average length and weight of w15 cm and
w530 g for the whole sample of handaxes (see Table 4), there
seems to be some size differences between those made from ﬂakes
and cobbles. Handaxes on ﬂakes are on average 160.1 mm long and
weigh 624.2 g, whereas those on cobbles are smaller (mean
length ¼ 141.4 mm) and lighter (513.1 g).
On technological and typological grounds, 21.6% of the 38 handaxes were classiﬁed as bifaces, 37.8% as knives, 2.7% (i.e., just one)
as a cleaver, and the rest (37.8%) were considered under the general
term of LCTs, as deﬁned by Isaac (1977) in Olorgesailie, and discussed for Olduvai (de la Torre and Mora, 2005) and Peninj (de la
Torre et al., 2008). The term LCT is not exclusive with respect to
the other categories (in fact bifaces, knives and cleavers from Gadeb
8D can all be classiﬁed as LCTs), but it was applied to those pieces
that would ﬁt in neither of the former categories.
Knives (as deﬁned by Kleindienst (1962)) in Gadeb 8D resemble
those from Peninj (de la Torre et al., 2008) and could be considered
as large, massive sidescrapers made on ﬂakes with one or two
denticulated edges opposite a blunt end (Figs. 22 and 23). Gadeb 8D
knives usually do not even show shaping of tips (common in Peninj),
although the removal of butts and/or the thinning of ventral bulbs
are not rare. Although no LCT cores have been found in Gadeb 8D,
features displayed by knives provide relevant information on ﬂaking
methods. As such, extraction technology of large ﬂake knife blanks
is remarkably simple. A preponderance of ﬂakes with largely cortical

785

dorsal sides and butts (some of the knives are actually 100% cortical)
suggest that completely unmodiﬁed large cobbles were struck with
no previous preparation whatsoever. The few scars displayed on the
knives are normally secondary (i.e., they belong to the shaping
processes), therefore indicating that preparation of large cobble
cores (probably no larger than 20 cm according to ﬂake morphology

and size) simply did not exist. Apparently, forceful blows on suitable
angles of natural cobbles were adequate to ﬂake the short, wide and
thick blanks used to shape knives.
Alongside knives, Gadeb 8D has a variety of unifacial shaped
tools made on blocks, or have no blunt edges, and which can be
considered under the rather general name of LCTs. Figs. 22 and 24

786

show some of these pieces. Here, retouch is identical to that on the
knives; (i.e., denticulated modiﬁcation of edges with sinuous
outlines). Shaping is also very similar, basically unifacial and with
no attempts to achieve biconvex and symmetrical volumes separated by continuous edges. As in the case of knives, these “uncategorized” LCTs can hardly be considered as bifaces, for they are
actually characterised by unifacial shaping, which is rather
common for LCTs that display largely cortical faces. These artefacts

are quite abundant in Gadeb 8D and very characteristic of Gadeb 8F,
and had been speciﬁcally termed unifaces (e.g., Clark, 1996).
To sum up, among the knives and other LCTs, retouch is not
continuous along the perimeter and there are no straight edges due
to the denticulated form of retouch. This retouch is limited to the
edges and at a wide angle, as opposed to that which is ﬂat, invasive
and shapes the pieces. There is rarely intersection of extractions from
the opposite edges of pieces, and therefore there is no management

of central volumes. In short, knives and other LCTs seem to represent
shaping processes in which the knappers were not interested in
achieving bifacial forms with biconvex and bilateral symmetry. On
the contrary, the aim seems to have been to get heavy-duty tools
with robust edges, irrespectively of their overall shape.
LCTs make up 78.4% of the assemblage and only the remaining
pieces can be considered as proper bifaces. Those bifaces (see

examples in Figs. 22 and 24) do seem to represent an attempt to
manage the central volume of handaxes through intersection of
extractions from either edge of the piece, and an effort to balance the
bilateral convexity through bifacial interaction of surfaces. However,
even these bifaces seem to fail in the management of the central
volume. As evidenced by the stepped scars and the progressively
more abrupt angle of negatives, bifaces show successive attempts to

reduce the central volume of surfaces, which were consistently
unsuccessful. Whether this failed reduction of volume is due to the
technical incompetence of knappers or caused by raw material
constraints (the latter being an issue yet to be studied), is a rather
more complicated question to address.
The Gadeb 8F assemblage
Gadeb 8F is at the top of the Mio Goro Formation in the Gadeb 8
locality, and is likely the youngest of all Gadeb sites. It is also the
assemblage with the highest percentage of fresh (68.4%) artefacts,
followed by those that are slightly abraded (22.6%) and a very small
percentage of abraded (9.0%) pieces (see SOM Fig. 1A). Although the
smallest lithic fraction is missing, Gadeb 8F is certainly the least
disturbed assemblage of the entire Gadeb sample. This allows
a more accurate assessment of the links between reduction
sequence elements than in other assemblages. Discrepancies
between Kurashina’s (1978) recounts and those in this paper are
higher than in Gadeb 2C, Gadeb 2B and Gadeb 8D, although Table 2
shows that divergences occur basically in the technologically least
important categories (unmodiﬁed blocks, angular and ﬂake fragments), whereas the main groups (cores, shaped tools, percussive

artefacts, ﬂakes) are well represented and small variations on
recounts correspond to different analytical perspectives.
Flakes predominate in Gadeb 8F (see Table 2 and Fig. 3), with
a total (n ¼ 48) nearly identical to that from Gadeb 2C (n ¼ 50), but
which was part of an assemblage three times larger. This proportionally higher number of ﬂakes in Gadeb 8F reinforces the notion
of better taphonomic preservation of debitage activities at Gadeb
8F when compared with other assemblages. Gadeb 8F ﬂakes have
an average length of approximately 5 cm, larger than the other
sites except for Gadeb 8D (Table 4). Indeed, 29.2% of the ﬂakes are
larger than 6 cm (see also Fig. 4A). Cortex either on butts (Fig. 4B)
or dorsal faces (Fig. 4C) is common, with only 10.4% of whole ﬂakes
being completely non-cortical. This conforms to dorsal surface
ﬂaking patterns. With an average of 2.38 negatives per ﬂake, few
dorsal surfaces have 3e4 scars or more (Fig. 4D). Although a few
edge-core ﬂakes (SOM Fig. 15) indicate reorganization of ﬂaking in
some instances, generally the ﬂaking direction of previous scars
(Fig. 16) suggests little rotation of cores and predominance of
unidirectional patterns. In short, Gadeb 8F ﬂakes indicate nonintensive reduction patterns of usually unidirectional cores aimed
to obtain w5 cm ﬂakes with no morphological standardization
(SOM Fig. 16).

Figure 16. Scar patterns on dorsal sides of ﬂakes in the Gadeb assemblages, following Castañeda’s (1999) design.

Cores (n ¼ 26) represent 19.6% of the assemblage, angular
fragments and unmodiﬁed material excluded (Fig. 3), and are only
partially consistent with the data derived from the ﬂakes. For
example, many ﬂakes are consistently larger than expected from
core dimensions; core length averages w78 mm (Fig. 6A), and the
mean weight is 420 g (Table 3). However, there is great variability in
size, with some cores as small as 33 mm and 45 g. Despite this

variability, all of the Gadeb 8F cores can be assigned to small debitage reduction sequences (no LCT cores were found in the
assemblage), but there is a great shortage of ﬂakes matching the
reduced dimensions of many cores. Other inconsistencies are
evident between ﬂake and core patterns. For example, although
most cores still preserve cortical surfaces (Fig. 6C), Gadeb 8F shows
by far the highest number of scars per core (9.19) of all assemblages

(Fig. 6B). Therefore, reduction intensity as deduced from cores is
higher than expected from the analysis of ﬂakes.
Core exploitation methods (Fig. 9 and Table 5) show a predominance (68.2%) of unifacial (USP, UAU1, UAU2, UAT, UP) over bifacial
systems. Reduction of independent surfaces by abrupt ﬂaking
(UAU1, UAU2, UAUT) is the most common; some cores indicate very
simple ﬂaking sequences where cortical striking platforms are used

to get short series of ﬂakes from single knapping surfaces. Others
show exploitation of independent surfaces (i.e., with no interaction
between planes), through the ﬂaking of short unidirectional and
abrupt-angled series of ﬂakes (e.g., Fig. 25 #3 and Fig. 26 #4). In
general, this is an expedient strategy in which surfaces are abandoned as soon as angles become too obtuse, either by discarding
the core or by seeking another ﬂaking surface. The latter may

explain the presence of some edge-core ﬂakes, as these do not seem
to refer to rejuvenation processes but to independently exploited
surfaces (see again SOM Fig. 15).
Chopper-like knapping methods (USP, BSP) represented in
Gadeb 8F (see Fig. 26), also indicate short reduction sequences.
Other cores show longer exploitation series, such as in BALP, BALT
and UP examples (Figs. 25 and 26); the ﬁrst two indicate maintenance of a bifacial edge that organizes ﬂaking, and UP cores illustrate full rotation of cores following the same exploitation surface.
However, all in all, Gadeb 8F cores do not show structured or
complex reduction sequences maintained through long exploitation processes. Quite the opposite, the knapping methods are rather
expedient and reﬂect little ability and/or interest on the maintenance of ﬂaking efﬁciency. However, some cores are surprisingly
small (with several examples under 5 cm length), casting doubts on
the utility of resulting ﬂakes and impeding a conclusive assessment
of ﬂaking intensity and knapping methods involved.
An evaluation of retouching processes in Gadeb 8F is also
complicated. Whereas in other Gadeb sites there is a neat size and
technological break between small retouched tool and LCT blanks,
in Gadeb 8F there seems to be a continuum in size of shaped
artefacts. This complicates assigning pieces to one or another
chaîne opératoire, which is made even more difﬁcult as several
artefacts do not reach the 10 cm threshold traditionally proposed
for handaxes (Kleindienst, 1962). This ﬂow between shaped tool

types has long been recognised (e.g., Isaac, 1977), and is particularly
meaningful in the case of Gadeb 8F. Here, strategies employed to
get blanks for shaped tools cannot be used as the only criterion to
separate retouched forms, and it is the type of retouch and the
typology of artefacts itself that seem to drive shaping patterns.
On these grounds, the number of small retouched tools as
recounted in Table 2 and Fig. 3 should be seen as an arbitrary group
based on size measurements, but which is in many ways similar to
that of pieces classiﬁed as LCTs. This continuum will be discussed
below, but what should be stressed here is the high number
(n ¼ 34) of small retouched pieces in Gadeb 8F, which makes up
23% of the artefacts (Fig. 3), the highest percentage of small shaped
tools of all Gadeb sites. 55.9% of small retouched tools are made on
ﬂake fragments, 41.2% on complete ﬂakes, and just one (2.9%) on
a cobble. The average length of small retouched pieces (approximately 6 cm) differs little from other sites (Table 4). Part of the Gadeb
8F retouched pieces sample shares the same typological characteristics as the other assemblages, i.e., irregular retouch on sinuous and
denticulated edges. However, Gadeb 8F also contains a signiﬁcant
number of artefacts with ﬁnely made retouch, which consistently
modiﬁes ﬂake edges and creates pointed forms (Fig. 27).
This trend towards more typological sophistication becomes
especially evident in what here will be called unifaces (after Clark,
1996). These unifaces, also named unifacial handaxes (Clark, 2001),
show a continuum of size, typology and technology, which blur

differences between the reduction sequences of small debitage and
LCTs. Originally described as “a special local form of scraper and
biface [which] is made on a cobble ﬂake, the retouch being conﬁned
to the ventral or ﬂake surface, while the dorsal face is formed only
by cortex” (Clark, 1980: 193), these pieces resemble some of those
described in Gadeb 8D (e.g., Fig. 23 #3, #5) and, in particular, show
remarkable technological and typological standardization. Examples from Figs. 28 and 29 (but also the small ones from Fig. 27 #2
and #3, proving the size continuum of these morphologies) show
exactly the same shaping technique; a ﬂat and cortical surface is

used as a knapping platform for shaping a pointed tool through
intensive retouch of the opposite face.
The shaping technique is quite standardized. There is no
exchange of ﬂaking and striking surfaces, but a rigid maintenance
of the same scheme of façonnage. On those made on ﬂakes or split
cobbles, the dorsal face is always selected as the striking platform to
shape the ventral side. On cobbles, the ﬂatter side is used as striking
platform. In both cases, there seems to be a conscious selection of
planar-convex blanks, in which the ﬂat surface is consistently used
as a knapping platform to shape the opposing convexity. Whereas

face is largely unretouched, with the exception of the removal of the butt and bulb. There is little bifacial symmetry and the distribution of volumes is dictated by the original shape
of the ﬂake, with no further reorganization of convexities. (2) Knife made on a wide and short ﬂake. Butt and dorsal face were originally cortical, although the butt has almost been

primarily unifacial, with shaping of an edge from one surface of the cobble, and the other surface from the opposite edge -see description of a similar (but not identical) “rhomboidal
technique” in de la Torre and Mora (2005).

Figure 23. Handaxes from Gadeb 8D. (1) Biface on cobble. Retouch is bifacial and shapes the tip and the two edges of the blank, attempting some kind of bifacial symmetry.

798

I. de la Torre / Journal of Human Evolution 60 (2011) 768e812

most LCTs described in other sites show marginal retouch restricted
to the edge of pieces, retouch in Gadeb 8F unifaces aims to reduce
central volumes through invasive shaping. However, it is signiﬁcant
that the central shaped volume of nearly all pieces in Figs. 28 and 29
is considerably limited by several lines of step scars around the
entire uniface perimeter. This consecutive stepping of central
volumes was probably caused by wide ﬂaking angles (simple or
semi-abrupt), as opposed to the ﬂat- angled shaping that would
have been required to successfully reduce the central surfaces of
blanks. Given the standardization of these unifaces and the careful
shaping of edges on some pieces, it could be argued that the thick
sections resulting from stepped central volumes were not knapping
accidents but the outcome of intentional scalariform retouch.
Although the term ‘biface’ is obviously unsuitable for these
pieces, most would agree that many examples from Figs. 28 and 29
ﬁt comfortably within the rather lax category of handaxes. The term
biface would also be inappropriate for the smaller unifaces which,
as argued here, share exactly the same technological and typological principles as the larger ones. This dilemma, which is purely
terminological and probably a meaningless one, reﬂects the ﬂexible
and pragmatic application in Gadeb 8F of very speciﬁc mental
templates to blanks obtained through different methods, ﬂakes
from small debitage sequences, split or complete cobbles, etc.
Gadeb 8F also has some elements more clearly associated with
the production of LCTs, among them a cleaver made on a large
(more than 1 kg) ﬂake, and a couple of sidescrapers on ﬂake blanks
that do not belong to the small debitage chaîne opératoire (Fig. 30).
Interestingly, the large cleaver more closely resembles the LCTs
from other Gadeb assemblages, with denticulated and marginal
retouch, basically focused on the thinning of the bulb, than to the
unifaces described above, reinforcing the peculiar traits of the
Gadeb 8F unifacial handaxes.
Finally, the presence of percussive tools in Gadeb 8F must be
highlighted. Although numerically (n ¼ 17) unimportant, in terms of
raw material weight (more than 15 kg; see Table 3) battered artefacts
are the largest group. As in Gadeb 2E, most battered tools are
hammerstones with fractured angles (82.4%), followed by regular
hammerstones (11.8%) and anvils (one only; 5.9%). The hammerstones with fractured angles are large (mean length ¼ 91.2 mm) and
heavy cobbles (mean weight ¼ 945.5 g), which usually have a heavily
pounded area opposite a cortical and largely unmodiﬁed surface. The
unevenness of battered surfaces and abundance of irregular ridges
prevent consideration of these pieces as regular hammerstones
typically used for knapping. However, given the doubt about the
association of fossils and artefacts (see above), at present it is difﬁcult
to assert the technological and functional signiﬁcance of these
artefacts.
Inter-assemblage variability of the Gadeb sites
The aim of descriptions in the above sections has been to
present the individual characteristic features of cores, ﬂakes, shaped and battered tools in each of the Gadeb assemblages.
Summaries of their main traits and inter-assemblage comparisons
can now be made.
Fragmentation of reduction sequences is one of the most
deﬁning features of all assemblages. This fragmentation is both
taphonomic and behavioural; the former refers to post-depositional processes causing acute shortage of debitage, in contrast

with an overabundance of core forms. But there is also an imbalance in the representation of some categories that probably
corresponds to knapper decision-making. This refers to the presence of handaxes, usually made on large ﬂakes, but for which cores
and other expected debitage by-products are missing. Therefore,
this fragmentation of the reduction sequence of large shaped tools
(which applies to all sites under study) involves off site production
(and arguably also façonnage) of large blanks. This fragmentation is
intimately linked to the recurring coexistence of two chaînes
opératoires. All of the Gadeb sites studied contain abundant cores
associated with the ﬂaking of small debitage, but all these assemblages also include large shaped tools on ﬂakes clearly obtained
through a different chaîne opératoire, that of LCTs.
Table 6 summarizes proportional frequencies of meaningful
technological traits indicated by inter-assemblage comparison.
Firstly, it is observed that exploitation of very small cores (less than
5 cm) occurred in all sites under study. Figs. 7, 8, 10, 17, 20 and 26,
show that Gadeb knappers often reduced very tiny blanks, which,
although usually do not present complex organization of ﬂaking,
demonstrate the knappers’ ability to manipulate difﬁcult-to-handle
cores. Given the local abundance of cobbles (as presumed from the
matrix conglomerates, high numbers of unmodiﬁed cobbles in the
assemblages, and larger dimensions of other cores), the availability
of raw material cannot be put forward as an explanation for the
diminutive size of some cores. The functional meaning of resulting
ﬂakes is also difﬁcult to assess, given their remarkably small size.
Intensity of reduction is not a satisfactory explanation either, as
many of these small cores show short sequences of ﬂaking and have
largely cortical surfaces. This indicates that the original blanks
selected as cores were already tiny forms. Whatever the case, the
fact that these very particular cores appear regularly in all Gadeb
sites could suggest shared technological patterns, which are difﬁcult to comprehend through strictly cost-beneﬁt explanations.
Another inter-assemblage trend is the rare occurrence of
structured ﬂaking methods. Knapping systems that require rigid
hierarchization of ﬂaking and striking surfaces (BHC) or dynamic
interaction between both planes (e.g., discoid) only appear occasionally (see Table 6). Clark and Kurashina (1976) mentioned the
presence of ‘proto- Levallois’ cores in Gadeb 8A, and Kurashina
(1978) reported predominance of ‘biconical’ cores in Gadeb 8E,
which are all probably similar to those described here for Gadeb 2E
and 8D. However, in general terms the ﬂaking methods of Gadeb
cores are rather expedient, with short reduction sequences, overly
cortical surfaces, lack of standardization in knapping methods, and
great size variability. It can thus be stated that Gadeb knappers
were selecting cobbles of various sizes (usually 5e10 cm long),
removing a few ﬂakes (inter-assemblage average of 7.1 scars per
core), and abandoning cores without attempts to reactivate ﬂaking
angles. In this case, the abundance of local raw materials might
explain the expedient ﬂaking pattern evident in all Gadeb sites.
The relative abundance of small retouched tools is another
general pattern, especially in Gadeb 2B, 8D and 8F. This is unlikely
to be a temporal trend, as Gadeb 2B has the second highest
percentage of small retouched pieces and is stratigraphically
contemporary with Gadeb 2C (see Fig. 1), which has a low
frequency of these tools. Although the KruskaleWallis test (based
on average length) suggests that there is no inter-assemblage size
homogeneity of small retouched pieces (H ¼ 17.2; 4 d.f.: p ¼ 0.002),
they all share similar techno-typological traits. Retouch is irregular,

retouch, and not even the tip is bifacially or more carefully shaped. (4) Originally classiﬁed as a cleaver (Kurashina, 1978), this piece is here considered as a knife. The ventral face is
completely unretouched and the dorsal face shows only a couple of secondary scars. This piece is technologically and typologically very similar to (5), although in the present case
both the dorsal face and the butt show some preparation of the large core prior to the extraction of the LCT blank. (5) Knife on a wide and short ﬂake. Dorsal face and butt are
completely cortical, and the ventral face shows thinning of the bulb. The opposite distal end displays denticulated retouch limited to the edge of the piece.

although this does not cover the whole perimeter of the artefact. (2) Cleaver made on a predominantly cortical ﬂake. (3) LCT on ﬂake. This piece is practically identical to those
considered as knives. A wide and short ﬂake is used as a blank shaped with denticulated and non-invasive retouch. The butt is removed and the bulb thinned, and there is no
biconvex reduction of volumes. The only typological feature that could differentiate this example from a knife is that there is no blunt edge opposed to a “cutting” one. (4) Biface

denticulated, unifacial and marginal, creating sinuous edges and
non-standardized shapes. One possible exception might be Gadeb
8F where, alongside irregular retouches, much more ﬁnely made
small retouched tools also appear.
Battered artefacts are relevant in only two of the sites studied,
Gadeb 2E and Gadeb 8F. Regular knapping hammerstones were
probably abundant in all sites, but the ambiguity that these pieces

sometimes present when compared with natural cobbles may
explain their low frequencies. Anvils are relatively numerous in
Gadeb 2E (n ¼ 14; 11.5% of battered artefacts), but they are only
marginally represented in Gadeb 8F and absent in other sites.
Special attention is paid here to hammerstones with fracture
angles, as deﬁned by Mora and de la Torre (2005). Kurashina (1978)
had already speciﬁed the relative abundance of such items (see

have been described above, but their size and morphological
homogeneity must be noted. The hammerstones with fracture
angles from both Gadeb 2E and 8F are cobbles with one face heavily
battered opposed to a unmodiﬁed cortical surface (Fig. 31).

In order for such extensive ridge damage to occur, battering
activities should have been remarkably intense in both sites. Some
hammerstones with fracture angles show smooth pitting on their
cortical surfaces that could be due to their use as regular knapping
hammers. However, the massive ridge damage on the opposite
faces caused irregular angles that are useless for knapping activities

(see discussion in Mora and de la Torre, 2005). Therefore, activities
conducted with these hammerstones with fracture angles must
have been different from those involving ﬂaking and shaping of
other artefacts. The Gadeb 2E and 8F battered artefacts are not only

morphologically similar, but also remarkably alike in dimensions, as supported by Student’s t-tests (normal distribution veriﬁed
with one-sample KolmogoroveSmirnov tests) of length (2-tailed
sig. ¼ 0.97) and weight (2-tailed sig. ¼ 0.43). This provides yet

another argument to sustain the functional particularities of battered tools in both assemblages.
Whereas battering activities seem to have been relevant only
in Gadeb 2E and 8F, the LTC chaîne opératoire is present at all sites
studied. As summarized in Table 6, handaxes are especially
abundant in Gadeb 8D, but are also present in Gadeb 8F, 2C, 2B
and, to a minor extent, in Gadeb 2E. Although all of the handaxes
could be included in the general classiﬁcation of Large Cutting
Tools, as deﬁned by Isaac (1977), three main types of handaxes
appear in the Gadeb assemblages. The ﬁrst group is one of typical
bifaces with more or less symmetrical bilateral and biconvex
shapes. A second group comprises the so-called unifaces, after
Clark (1996), characterised by very particular shaping methods
centred on the façonnage of single faces opposed to cortical
knapping platforms. Finally, a third group was here considered as
knives (sensu Kleindienst, 1962) and other heavy-duty forms,
characterised by the poor volume management and the crude
modiﬁcation of the edges of large ﬂakes, and to a minor extent,
cobbles.
Since features of these handaxe groups have been detailed in
previous sections, it is now relevant to discuss their inter-assemblage composition; knives and other “crude” LCTs appear literally in
all assemblages studied. They show a strikingly similar pattern, in
which some large ﬂakes (nearly all sites contain ﬂake blanks over

1 kg) are obtained and probably shaped elsewhere, co-occurring
with a much larger sample of elements belonging to the small
debitage chaîne opératoire. Proper bifaces appear preferentially
in Gadeb 8D and unifaces are characteristic of Gadeb 8F. Given
the small number of true bifaces in Gadeb 8D (n ¼ 8 out of 37
handaxes), it could tentatively be argued that their absence in other
assemblages is due to the smaller sample of LCTs at those sites. In
truth, none of the Gadeb 8D bifaces are too different from other
handaxes regarding size, blanks, etc., and the only distinction may
lie on a larger reduction sequence of bifacial shapes. The case of
unifaces is arguably different. Although some similar pieces occur
in Gadeb 8D, unifaces are idiosyncratic of Gadeb 8F. As discussed
above, there is a continuum of size and morphology among unifaces from small retouched pieces to handaxes >10 cm, all with
cortical faces opposed to extensively shaped faces. In this case there
is no clear distinction between elements of the small debitage and
LCT chaîne opératoire, and all suggests the application of speciﬁc
mental templates to the shaping of tools in Gadeb 8F, regardless of
size. In other words, in Gadeb 8F there is evidence for a kind of
technical idiosyncrasy that may allow for local (and probably very
particular) technological trends.
In sum, it can be argued that with reference to the LCT chaîne
opératoire, the two main aspects of inter-assemblage variability are
the different percentages of handaxes (with Gadeb 8D and 2E

804

having the highest and lowest percentages, respectively), and the
particular traits of the Gadeb 8F unifaces. Apart from that, the
handaxe chaîne opératoire is remarkably similar in all sites, with
prevalence of rather unstructured LCTs and pieces made on large
ﬂakes for which their cores are lacking, indicating a fragmentation
of the reduction sequence from quarry to site.
Those similarities are not only qualitative, but can also be veriﬁed
by quantitative patterns. Whereas non-parametric tests could not
prove similarities between small debitage cores (hence emphasizing
the inter-assemblage variability aforementioned), KruskaleWallis
tests of several handaxe features seem to suggest contrasting results.
Comparisons of length (H ¼ 2.92; 4 d.f.; p ¼ 0.57), scar count
(H ¼ 3.08; 3 d.f.; p ¼ 0.37), percentage of cortex (H ¼ 6.78; 4 d.f.;
p ¼ 0.48), and handaxe blanks (H ¼ 3.52; 4 d.f.; p ¼ 0.47), attest to the
similarity of LCTs from all sites.
Therefore, qualitative and quantitative arguments lead to the
conclusion that no obvious differences exist between handaxes
from the ﬁve sites under study. These conclusions could tentatively
be extended to Gadeb 8E, an assemblage not included in this study
but for which a detailed report is available (Clark and Kurashina,
1979b). According to these authors, split and whole cobbles, and
side and end-struck ﬂakes were used as blanks for handaxes and
cleavers. Clark and Kurashina (1979b) recognised unifacial and fully
bifacial LCTs, but reported that the most common pieces were what
they called partial-bifacial retouched artefacts, in which minimum

retouch was present. Overall, Gadeb 8E pieces appear not be too
different from those described in this paper, which is not surprising
given the similar stratigraphic position of Gadeb 8E and Gadeb 8D
(Clark and Kurashina, 1979a). Nevertheless, at Gadeb 8A (also in the
same stratigraphic position and only 800 m north of Gadeb 8D)
there seems to be a prevalence of proper bifaces and even softhammer technique (Kurashina, 1978), which has not been observed
in the assemblages studied here.
Once inter-assemblage variability for each individual category
has been summarized, the overall composition of each assemblage
shall be discussed. In Gadeb 2E, the co-occurrence of three different
chaînes opératoires must be emphasized. The production of small
debitage appears alongside large blanks typical of the LCT chaîne
opératoire, and heavily battered artefacts unrelated to knapping
activities form a third group of stone tool use/production. Knapping
methods are varied, from structured ﬂaking systems to rather
expedient ones. Size variability is also high, from cores less than
4 cm to some heavier than 2 kg. Small retouched pieces are scarce,
in stark contrast with other Gadeb sites. However, the low
percentage of handaxes does not mean that the LCT chaîne opératoire is underrepresented. While Gadeb 2E may have the lowest
number of LCTs of all of the Gadeb sites, it also contains the highest
amount of unmodiﬁed large ﬂakes (nearly a dozen, including sever
alweighing more than 1 kg), which could be considered as potential
LCT blanks. When these pieces are taken into account, the number

of elements that can be attributed to typically Acheulean technologies increases signiﬁcantly.
The Gadeb 2C assemblage contains elements of the small debitage and LCTs chaînes opératoires. Knapping methods are usually
expedient, with short reduction sequences and poor maintenance
of ﬂaking angles. Size variability is also high and diminutive cores
such as those in Gadeb 2E and other assemblages suggest knappers’
manual dexterity. Small retouched pieces are more abundant than
in Gadeb 2E, although substantially less numerous than in the other
sites. The LCT chaîne opératoire is attested residually, but indicates
ﬂaking of large blanks that were then turned into handaxes.

Gadeb 2B also yielded materials attributable to the small debitage and LCT chaînes opératoires. The latter is not only represented
by handaxes, but also by some unretouched large ﬂakes produced
within the LCT reduction sequence. However, there are few large
shaped elements, which contrast with the high percentage of small
retouched tools. As a whole, Gadeb 2B seems to be characterized by
quite simple knapping methods, some elements of the LCT reduction sequence and above all, by high numbers of small and nonstandardized retouched pieces. The assemblage of Gadeb 8D has
similar traits to Gadeb 2B. Small debitage reduction sequences
predominate, knapping methods are generally expedient, there are
many small and unstructured retouched pieces, handaxes are not
intensively shaped, and there are no LCT cores. It is true that there is

a substantially larger number of LCTs, but this is the only difference
with the other assemblages.
Gadeb 8F is probably the most idiosyncratic of all of the Gadeb
sites, due to particularities of its shaped tools. These tools show
a size and morphological continuum, which highlights a strong
predetermination of shape templates but also dilutes the clear
differences found in other assemblages between the small debitage
and LCT chaînes opératoires (e.g., SOM Fig. 17). Despite these
peculiarities, Gadeb 8F ﬁts within the same patterns described for
the other assemblages, with a predominance of small debitage
sequences, simple reduction methods, a high number of small
retouched pieces, some LCT blanks and space/time fragmentation
of this typically Acheulean chaîne opératoire.

The main point to make here is that Gadeb assemblages show no
technical divergences that could justify their assignment to different
cultural/functional/technological traditions. Relative frequencies of
some categories, such as battered tools, small retouched pieces, or
handaxes do vary, but the underlying technological strategies are
the same in all assemblages. There is a predominance of small
debitage reduction systems (usually expedient ones), which cooccur with variable numbers of small retouched pieces and LCTs on
large ﬂakes and blocks, in general only partially shaped. This latter
chaîne opératoire invariably appears fragmented, with the large
blanks being ﬂaked off site and transported to the site either as
shaped artefacts or large ﬂake blanks. Of course, some qualitative
and especially quantitative inter-assemblage variability exists,
particularly in the composition of LCTs, but the technological
background is the same. This could be valid not only for the sites
described in this paper, but also elsewhere in Gadeb (Fig. 32).
Therefore, should this point on the overall homogeneity of assemblages be accepted, what needs to be considered now is the relationship of the Gadeb assemblages to other ESA sites, and the
resulting implications for the understanding of early stone tool
technologies in Eastern Africa.
Gadeb and the Developed Oldowan/early Acheulean debate in
East Africa
The long and uncertain time interval of the Gadeb assemblages
between 1.45 and 0.7 Ma poses two different archaeological problems, the origins of the Acheulean and the inter-assemblage variability of lithic technologies at the end of the Lower Pleistocene. In
recent years, much effort has been invested in dating the earliest
Acheulean and presently there is solid evidence placing the origins
of this technology in East Africa at 1.7e1.6 Ma (Asfaw et al., 1992;
Roche et al., 2003; Quade et al., 2004). However, the technological
change that led to the emergence of the Acheulean is still poorly
understood, despite ongoing discussions (e.g., Leakey, 1971, 1975;
Bower, 1977; Stiles, 1977; Gowlett, 1988; de la Torre and Mora,
2005; de la Torre, 2009; Semaw et al., 2009). Not only is it unclear
how and why small debitage methods, typical of the Oldowan, gave
way to Acheulean technology based on the production of huge
blanks made into shaped tools, but the status of industries lacking
handaxes after the appearance of the Acheulean is also uncertain. To
address this second issue, Leakey (e.g., 1967) coined the term
Developed Oldowan. Immediately popularised after the publication
of the classic monograph on Olduvai Beds I and II (Leakey, 1971), the
concept of Developed Oldowan provided a straightforward way to
categorize assemblages and assign them to different cultural and
even biological ﬁla. As the long standing debate on the Developed
Oldowan versus Acheulean in Olduvai Gorge has been summarized
elsewhere (de la Torre and Mora, 2005: 225-228), it may seem more
relevant now to discuss its implications for the interpretation of
other East African assemblages.
Leakey (1971, 1994) used several factors to assign assemblages
either to the Developed Oldowan B or the Acheulean, such as the
blank types used to shape handaxes, biface size and morphology,
and relative frequencies of handaxes. This latter factor followed
Kleindienst’s (1962) original proposal, in which an assemblage
must contain 40% of handaxes or more in the tools group for it to be
considered Acheulean. Therefore, whereas other arguments posed
by Leakey (1971) were based on her own observations at Olduvai
Middle and Upper Bed II, the requisite of handaxe frequencies followed a study of more recent assemblages (Kleindienst, 1962).
Curiously enough, although all authors employing the term
Developed Oldowan followed Leakey’s deﬁnition, peculiarities of
each archaeological sequence preclude the use of most traits once
deﬁned in Olduvai, with the result that handaxe frequency has been

the more extensively used criterion to consider sites as either
Developed Oldowan or Acheulean. This is not to say that authors
adhered strictly to the rather arbitrary 40% handaxe threshold once
proposed by Kleindienst (1962), but that very low percentages of
handaxes have been used as a main criterion to classify Developed
Oldowan sites across East Africa. From the inception of the term in
Olduvai (Leakey, 1967, 1971), Developed Oldowan sites have been
named in a signiﬁcant number of East African early Pleistocene
sequences, such as Chesowanja (Harris and Gowlett, 1980), Koobi
Fora (Braun et al., 2008), West Turkana (Texier et al., 2006), Melka
Kunture (Chavaillon and Piperno, 2004), Middle Awash (Clark et al.,
1984) and of course, Gadeb (e.g., Clark and Kurashina, 1979a).
This dichotomy between assemblages with and without handaxes is not limited to the time period concerning the earliest
emergence of the Acheulean, but seems to be a recurrent pattern in
East Africa during the late Early Pleistocene and through the Middle
Pleistocene. Leakey (1994) described a number of assemblages in
Olduvai Beds III and IV with few or no handaxes, and which were in
her opinion a continuation of the Developed Oldowan B, but now
termed Developed Oldowan C. In Olorgesailie, the Hope Mountain
Industry (Posnasky, 1959) was compared with handaxe assemblages (Isaac, 1977), and placed according to the ecological distribution of sites (Potts, 2001). In the late Lower Pleistocene and
throughout the Middle Pleistocene, assemblages with and without
handaxes are also found in Middle Awash and are again related to
variable environmental settings (de Heinzelin et al., 2000). In West
Turkana, Middle Pleistocene sites have been reported with large
assemblages but in which no handaxes are present (Delagnes et al.,
2006), and a similar pattern is documented in the Late Acheulean of
Kapthurin (McBrearty, 2001). Therefore, in East Africa it is well
documented that small debitage chaînes opératoires were extensively used after the emergence of the Acheulean and throughout
the development of this techno-complex, either in co-occurrence
with handaxes or without them.
Traditional interpretations of technological change linked novel
cultures to the emergence of new human species. The classic
explanation of inter-assemblage variability in Olduvai from Middle
Bed II onwards associated Homo habilis with the Developed Oldowan, and the new Homo erectus with the Acheulean (Leakey, 1971).
It could be argued that, as Mary Leakey’s type list was deeply
inﬂuenced by F. Bordes’ typology (de la Torre and Mora, 2009), so
also was her interpretation of inter-assemblage variability. Indeed,
Leakey’s correlation of industries and hominins was not too
different from the interpretation of Mousterian facies proposed by
Bordes (e.g., Bordes and Sonneville-Bordes, 1970). Nonetheless,
direct associations between hominins/cultures and technologies are
problematic, especially when long coexistence of different species
of Homo has now begun to be demonstrated (Spoor et al., 2007).
Functional interpretations of inter-assemblage variability were
proposed earlier than usually acknowledged. For example, Posnasky
(1959) proposed that the presence of some handaxe-free assemblages in Olorgesailie was not explained by cultural divergences, but
due to the different set of activities conducted. Probably the most
popular interpretation of this inter-assemblage variability is that
based on ecological variables. Although this hypothesis is widely
attributed to Hay (1976), it was Isaac (1971) who ﬁrst proposed it, as
acknowledged by Hay (1990), himself. Both authors suggest that the
location near the lake shore of most Developed Oldowan sites at
Olduvai in contrast to the inland-riverine environments of early
Acheulean sites could indicate different activities in a variety of
ecological settings by the same groups of hominins. This hypothesis,
which moves away from culture-history explanations such as Leakey’s, has been widely used to understand variable frequencies of
handaxes in Olorgesailie (e.g., Potts et al., 1999) and Middle Awash
(de Heinzelin et al., 2000), for instance. However, it has been argued

I. de la Torre / Journal of Human Evolution 60 (2011) 768e812

that such a dichotomy (Acheulean ¼ ﬂuvial environments versus
Developed Oldowan ¼ lake shore settings) may be too rigid (de la
Torre, 2008: 185-191). Sometimes undisputable Acheulean sites
appear in lake-margin environments, such as Konso (Beyene et al.,
1996) or West Turkana (Roche et al., 2003), while there are chronologically contemporary assemblages in riverine environments that
contain only a few handaxes, such as some of the Melka Kunture
sites (Chavaillon and Piperno, 2004) or Gadeb itself (Clark and
Kurashina, 1979a; this paper).
Despite the above reservations, the potential of the ecological
hypothesis is that it allows an approach to inter-assemblage variability via a functional compartmentalization of landscape, rather
than through links between industries and particular human
species. It has been proposed elsewhere that this problem can be
addressed on technological grounds (de la Torre, 2008). For
example, the use of handaxe percentages as a proxy for assemblage
characterization can be challenged. In functional terms, it is true
handaxe frequency in an assemblage must have a meaning. A large
concentration of handaxes in one particular spot will deﬁnitely be
the result of a different activity/behaviour to that where handaxes
are scarce or absent. However, to paraphrase Gowlett (1986), where
technological ability per se is concerned, one handaxe is the same
as forty. Quantity of objects is irrelevant, and the presence of large
cutting tools with particular morphologies, regardless of number,
imply that knappers had the cognitive and practical skills to
manufacture these tools. Following Lemonnier (1990), here it is
assumed that the adoption of any innovation (in this case Acheulean technology), be it local or imported, automatically implies that
such an innovation (raw material requirements, manufacturing
tools, know-how, functional connotations, etc.) is fully understood
by knappers. From this viewpoint, quantitative discussions are not
very useful. If an assemblage contains handaxes, it means that the
required technological and cognitive skills to produce them are
present, and therefore the site belongs to the same techno-complex
as any other where handaxes are plentiful, even if their functional
roles differ.
If handaxe frequency is ruled out as a valid criterion, the same
can apply to LCT morphology and blanks, other indicators once
employed to discriminate between Developed Oldowan and the
Acheulean (e.g., Leakey, 1971). Handaxe morphology is ultimately
dictated by the blanks used. Sometimes cobbles predominate over
ﬂake blanks, such as at Gona (Semaw et al., 2009), or ﬂakes are
preferentially selected, as occurs at EFHR in Olduvai (de la Torre and
Mora, 2005), and at Mugulud and Bayasi in Peninj (de la Torre et al.,
2008). In other instances, tabular blocks are the most commonly
selected blanks for handaxes, as in TK at Olduvai (de la Torre and
Mora, 2005). Preferential selection of some blanks over others
certainly has an impact on handaxe shape. However, as argued by
Sharon (2008), Acheulean LCT technology (or technologies) show
remarkable similarities world-wide, regardless of the raw materials
employed. To use examples from East Africa, Lower Pleistocene
handaxes in Mugulud and Bayasi in Peninj (de la Torre et al., 2008),
Olduvai (de la Torre and Mora, 2005) and Gadeb (this paper), all
show similar shaping methods, in which façonnage is usually constrained to the edges of pieces and does not extend over whole
surfaces, retouch is normally unifacial, irregular and non-invasive,
pointed forms are sought, and bifacial and bilateral symmetry is
uncommon. There is an application of preconceived morphological
templates, as pointed out by Isaac (1986), which are ﬂexible and
adapted to locally available raw materials, as Clark (1980) once
claimed.
Therefore, it is argued here that neither handaxe frequency nor
LCT morphology are consistent arguments to differentiate the
Developed Oldowan from the Acheulean. All the so-called Developed Oldowan B sites in Olduvai have variable frequencies of

809

handaxes (de la Torre and Mora, 2005), and the same applies to
Gadeb and others. Therefore, if the arguments presented above are
accepted, they would all ﬁt within the Acheulean techno-complex.
However, what happens with those assemblages that postdate the
emergence of the Acheulean but are without handaxes? Although
scarce, <1.6 Ma non-handaxe assemblages exist in the East African
Early Stone Age, as reported in Nyabusosi (Texier, 1995), the Peninj
ST site complex (de la Torre et al., 2003), Chesowanja (Gowlett et al.,
1981), West Turkana (Delagnes et al., 2006), Olorgesailie (Isaac,
1977), Middle Awash (de Heinzelin et al., 2000) and others.
Whereas the Acheulean character of Middle Pleistocene assemblages is acknowledged by nearly all authors, there is discussion as
to whether or not early the <1.6 Ma Pleistocene sites are still
Oldowan.
In the search for technological arguments to explain the
absence of handaxes, it has been suggested that small debitage
systems could also provide a key to trace Acheulean technologies
(Gowlett, 1986; de la Torre, 2008, 2009). Gowlett (1986) suggested
that bifacial ﬂaking of discoid cores shares the same concepts and
mental templates as handaxe production, and therefore both must
be interrelated. On similar lines, de la Torre (2008, 2009) argued
that complex debitage systems, as reported originally in Nyabusosi
(Texier, 1995) and then in Peninj (de la Torre et al., 2003) and
Olduvai Middle and Upper Bed II (de la Torre and Mora, 2005),
appear concurrently with the ﬁrst LCTs in East Africa. In Peninj, for
example, assemblages with and without LCTs show almost identical small debitage ﬂaking methods, in which structured strategies such as the bifacial hierarchical centripetal system prevail (de
la Torre, 2009). Since know-how and technical competence is the
same in both types of sites, inter-assemblage variability is
explained by functional and ecological differences (de la Torre,
2009). Similarly, it is symptomatic that a review of Olduvai Bed I
and II knapping methods (de la Torre and Mora, 2005) only
reported systematic appearance of small debitage structured
ﬂaking systems in sites postdating the emergence of the Acheulean. While belonging to different chaînes opératoires, LCT
production and structured small debitage methods in Olduvai are
also concurrent.
It has been argued (e.g., Gowlett, 1986; de la Torre, 2008) that
the mere presence of handaxes, irrespective of their frequency, is
indicative of the Acheulean character of the assemblage, and that if
handaxes are absent in <1.6 Ma assemblages, other proxies can be
sought, such as the presence of structured methods of small debitage production (de la Torre, 2009). Of course, these arguments do
not work everywhere. For example, this paper has shown that small
debitage systems in Gadeb were rather simple, despite their
co-occurrence with LCT chaînes opératoires. Therefore, it would be
an oversimpliﬁcation to state that handaxe production always coappears with structured small debitage systems. For these reasons,
it is the study of the overall composition of assemblages that must
lead to conclusions over the nature of technological strategies
employed on each site. Whereas in other regions, such as Europe,
there is an overwhelming predominance of only one chaîne
opératoire, that of handaxes, the East African Acheulean yields
consistence co-occurrence of LCT and small debitage reduction
sequences. Only the combined study of both will explain the large
inter-assemblage variability reported in this region.
It only remains to address where the Gadeb sites ﬁt in the
framework of this discussion. Cultural assignment of the Gadeb
assemblages changed even among the original excavators. Clark
and Kurashina (1976) attributed Gadeb 2B and 2C to the Developed Oldowan B, Gadeb 8A to the Upper Acheulean and Gadeb 8D
to the earlier Acheulean. A subsequent more complete assessment
of all assemblages (Clark and Kurashina, 1979a) maintained Gadeb
2B and 2C as Developed Oldowan B, the same techno-complex to

810

I. de la Torre / Journal of Human Evolution 60 (2011) 768e812

which Gadeb 2A, 2E and 8F were also included, while Gadeb 8A,
8D and a new assemblage, Gadeb 8E, were considered as Acheulean. This classiﬁcation eventually experienced some changes and
when referring to Gadeb 8F, it was stated that “the presence of
a few bifaces suggests that this is an Acheulian butchery site”
(Clark and Kurashina, 1979b: 146). Gadeb 8F was subsequently
reclassiﬁed along with Gadeb 2E as Developed Oldowan C (Clark,
1987), while Kurashina (1987) questioned the dubious meaning of
the term Developed Oldowan and proposed classifying such sites
in Gadeb as simply Oldowan. These authors were aware of the
terminological ambiguities, and Clark himself stated that despite
the nomenclature used, “it is increasingly apparent that any
attempt at strict separation and division into Developed Oldowan
or Acheulian probably has little true signiﬁcance, especially if
artefact forms are activity-related” (Assefa et al., 1982: 42e43)
Changes of cultural allocation by the original excavators of the
Gadeb assemblages reﬂect problems of the Developed Oldowan
as a concept and difﬁculties in accommodating its signiﬁcance in
the framework of technological change during the Early Stone
Age. This problem is certainly not exclusive to the Gadeb
assemblages. For example, Leakey (1975) modiﬁed the taxonomic
assignment of some assemblages proposed originally as Developed Oldowan to Acheulean (Leakey, 1971). Chesowanja was
originally classiﬁed as Developed Oldowan (Harris and Gowlett,
1980) and then as Oldowan (Gowlett et al., 1981), handaxe-free
assemblages in Peninj were considered as Oldowan (de la Torre
et al., 2003) and then as Acheulean (de la Torre, 2009), etc.
Even beyond Africa, techno-cultural assignment changes have
occurred in key archaeological sequences such as ‘Ubeidiya,
originally considered as containing both Developed Oldowan and
Acheulean layers (Bar-Yosef and Goren-Inbar, 1993), but which
was recently assigned as a whole to the Acheulean (Bar-Yosef and
Belfer-Cohen, 2001).
This all reﬂects the ambiguities of the term Developed Oldowan,
which has long been criticized (Stiles, 1977, 1980; Gowlett, 1986; de
la Torre and Mora, 2005; Semaw et al., 2009), but which is still often
employed in recent literature. In fact, and focusing solely on Gadeb,
most references to these assemblages have mentioned the
supposed dichotomy between Developed Oldowan and Acheulean
in this sequence (e.g., Stiles, 1980; Isaac, 1982, 1984; Binford, 1985;
Potts, 1991; Schick and Toth, 1994; Kyara, 1999; etc.). However, the
particular aim of the description of Gadeb assemblages presented
in this paper has been to emphasize the existence of a technological
background that is shared by all sites, despite variability in type
percentages. All of the Gadeb sites have similar methods of small
debitage reduction, similar types of small retouched tools, and
similar types of LCTs, all exploited following a similar chaîne
opératoire. According to these patterns, this paper maintains that
all the Gadeb sites pertain to the same techno-complex.
Isaac (1986) once proposed that the emergence of the Acheulean introduced two main innovations compared with the
Oldowan. One was the addition of one further step in manufacture
(i.e., the production of large ﬂakes that would subsequently be used
as blanks for shaped tools). The second was the application of
predetermined mental templates onto the shaping of artefacts,
leading to objects (i.e., handaxes) that show an overall similar
morphology. In addition to Isaac’s (1986) traits, this paper argues
for two further innovations of the early Acheulean. One is the new
ability to detach large ﬂakes off huge cores, a technique substantially more difﬁcult than ﬂaking small hand-held cores, and the
second is the spatial and temporal fragmentation of the life history
of LCTs, for there is usually separation between quarry activities,
façonnage and use/discard of handaxes. These features are clearly
present in all the Gadeb assemblages which therefore, should all be
regarded as Acheulean sites.

Conclusions
The aim of this paper was to present a systematic account of
some relevant assemblages from the Gadeb sequence, with
particular emphasis on those mentioned in the literature as
examples of the Developed Oldowan. Although references to these
sites have been constant over the last few decades, no revision of
the actual collections had ever been published until now. Following
a technological approach, this study has attempted to provide
a detailed report of the lithic assemblages of Gadeb 2E, 2B, 2C, 8D
and Gadeb 8F, from their overall composition to the particularities
of each stone tool category.
One of the main conclusions is that, in general, the Gadeb
assemblages are biased and signiﬁcantly affected by post-depositional processes. This affects both the proportions of lithic categories, which are here considered to differ from those originally
noted, and the relationship between stone tools, natural rocks and
fossils, for which an accidental co-occurrence cannot be excluded.
The assemblage chronology ranges between 1.45 and 0.7 Ma, but at
present it is difﬁcult to be more precise. Clark and Kurashina (1976)
emphasized the resemblances between the Gadeb 2 sites and
Middle- Upper Bed II in Olduvai, while Barbetti et al. (1980) estimated an age for Gadeb 8E at around one million years. Certainly,
the chronological bracket of the Gadeb sites is currently too wide,
and further chrono-stratigraphic work is needed to reﬁne the
sequence. Nevertheless, the lower and upper parts of the deposits
are ﬁrmly dated (Williams et al., 1979; Haileab and Brown, 1994),
and therefore provide a chronological framework within which to
broadly contextualize the archaeological record at Gadeb.
This paper has also argued that all Gadeb assemblages contain
elements of two different chaînes opératoires, one relating to small
size debitage and the other associated with LCT production. In all
Gadeb sites, small debitage ﬂaking is usually unstructured and
indicates a prevalence of short reduction sequences. However,
nearly all the assemblages studied contain very small cores that
are difﬁcult to accommodate within rationales of functional or
economic requirements, and which also suggest that knapping
skills may not have been as simple as those indicated by the short
reduction sequences evident on most cores. Furthermore, virtually
all the studied sites bear variable percentages of shaped tools, from
small retouched pieces to LCTs made on huge ﬂakes and cobbles.
These LCTs are usually minimally shaped, and concepts of
symmetry and bifaciality are found only in some handaxes and not
in all assemblages. The sharp break between the small debitage
chaîne opératoire and that of LCTs (for which early elements of the
sequence such as large cores and waste are missing), is accompanied on sites such as Gadeb 8F by a continuum in the technology,
size and morphology of shaped tools. Indeed, the Gadeb 8F
assemblage provides one of the strongest cases for speciﬁc mental
templates in Early Stone Age technologies, due to the very particular characteristics of its shaped tools.
As recently pointed out (Stout et al., 2010), ecological and
economic divergences (and this paper would also include stylistic
variations) are not enough to render interpretations of multiple
tool-making traditions. Here, it is argued that only detailed studies
of complete collections (rather than the study of single variables or
categories across sites) provide sound arguments that enable
discussion and characterization of the technology of one assemblage and its consequent comparison with other sites. The patterns
emerging from the adoption of this perspective indicate that,
despite the variable frequencies of tools, all Gadeb sites show the
same technological background. The results of the present study
indicate that the entire Gadeb series can be considered as an
example of the inter-assemblage variability existing in the Acheulean at the end of the Lower Pleistocene.
