The faunal sample from the Middle Stone Age (MSA) and overlying Later Stone Age (LSA) deposits of
Diepkloof Rock Shelter (Western Cape Province, South Africa) includes at least 40 taxa, mostly mammals,
but also tortoises, snakes, birds (especially ostrich represented by eggshell), and intertidal mollusks. The
LSA sample contains only species that occurred nearby historically, including domestic sheep, which LSA
people introduced to the region by 1800 years ago. In contrast, like other Western Cape MSA faunas, the
Diepkloof MSA sample has more species and it is especially notable for ﬁve large extralimital grazing
species. These imply a greater-than-historic role for grasses in the local vegetation, particularly in the
post-Howiesons Poort (latest MSA) interval where the grazers appear most abundant. Extreme fragmentation and dark-staining impedes analysis of the MSA bones, but cut-marks, abundant burning, and
numerous associated artifacts suggest that people were the main accumulators. Rare coprolites imply
that carnivores could have contributed some bones, and concentrations of small mammal bones, particularly near the bottom of the MSA sequence, suggest a role for raptors. Tortoise bones are common
throughout the sequence, and the MSA specimens tend to be especially large, as in other MSA
assemblages. The LSA specimens are smaller, probably because LSA human populations were denser and
preyed on tortoises more intensively. The most surprising aspect of the Diepkloof assemblage is its
marine component. The coast is currently 14 km away and it would have been even more distant during
much of the MSA when sea levels were often lower. Intertidal mollusks, particularly black mussels and
granite limpets, are concentrated in the LSA and in the Late and Post-Howiesons Poort layers. Only LSA
shells are complete enough for measurement, and the limpets are small as at other LSA sites. The
implication is again for more intense LSA collection by relatively dense human populations. Both the LSA
and MSA deposits also contain bones of shorebirds and Cape fur seals. Whale barnacles and occasional
dolphin bones indicate that MSA people scavenged beached cetaceans.

1. Diepkloof Rock Shelter: history of excavation, stratigraphy,
and dating
Diepkloof Rock Shelter is located about 180 km north of Cape
Town in the Western Cape Province of South Africa (Fig. 1). It faces
northeastwards atop an isolated outcrop of quartzitic sandstone,
120 m above the southern bank of the Verlorenvlei River, which
ﬂows into the Atlantic Ocean about 14 km to the northwest. A
quartzitic sill partially dams the river at the mouth, broadening it
into a narrow coastal lake that extends from the coast to Diepkloof.

The vegetation nearby comprises semi-arid shrublands adapted to
long hot summers and short cool winters. Rainfall comes almost
entirely in winter. Historically, wildlife ﬂourished nearby, due to the
lake and to perennial spring-fed marshes in the valley to the east.
The shelter ﬂoor measures 25 m across the mouth and 17e22 m
from dripline to rear wall. It is largely surrounded by fallen boulders
that provide about 200 sq m of protected space. Excavation began
in 1973 and initially focused on the Later Stone Age (LSA)
deposits, which were exposed at the surface in the form of a
central ash spread and overlapping wads of grass bedding along
the rear wall (Parkington and Poggenpoel, 1987). The bedding ﬁlled shallow basins that the LSA occupants had dug into underlying
Middle Stone Age (MSA) deposits. The excavation produced reed
and wooden artifacts and abundant faunal remains including
numerous bones of domestic sheep. The principal stone artifacts
were pieces that the LSA people had scuffed or pitted from the

and technology have been used to group the SUs into nine
complexes (from bottom to top): a lower MSA; the technologically distinct MSA-Mike and Pre-Still Bay Lynn; Still Bay (SB);
Early Howiesons Poort (HP); the technologically distinct MSAJack; Intermediate HP; Late HP; and ﬁnally Post-HP (Porraz
et al., 2013). Elsewhere in southern Africa, Still Bay and Howiesons Poort occupations are stratiﬁed together only at Apollo 11
Shelter (Vogelsang et al., 2010), Peers Cave (Volman, 1984),
Sibudu Cave (Wadley, 2007, 2010), and Umhlatuzana Cave
(Lombard et al., 2010). Among these sites, only Sibudu has provided faunal samples that compare in size to those from Diepkloof (Clark and Plug, 2008; Plug, 2004).
Twenty-eight burnt stone artifacts and ﬁve sediment samples
from the current Diepkloof excavation have been dated by thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)
respectively (Tribolo et al., 2013). The dates suggest mean ages of
100  10 ka and 107  11 ka for the lower MSA (SUs Noël and Mark),
100  10 ka for MSA type Lynn (SU Lynn-Leo), 109  10 ka for the SB
(SUs Kim-Larry), 105  10 ka and 109  10 ka for the early HP (SUs
Kerry-Kate and Jess), 89  8 for the MSA type Jack (SU Jude),
77  8 ka, 85  9 ka, 83  8 ka and 65  8 ka for the Intermediate
HP (SUs John, Fox, Fred and OB5), and 52  5 ka for the Late HP (SUs
OB2-4). Previous OSL readings on quartz grains provided ages of
97e82 ka for the lower MSA (Pre-SB), 76e69 ka for the SB, 65e
59 ka for the HP, and 57e46 ka for the Post-HP (Jacobs et al.,
2008), but one of the SUs included as Still Bay (Kerry, with a date
of 70.8  1.8 ka) has now been reassigned to the Early HP (Porraz
et al., 2013). Tribolo et al. (2013) believe that Jacobs et al. (2008)
used incorrect parameters to calculate equivalent doses and thus
underestimated the ages of the deepest samples by 10% or more,
explaining the discrepancy between the two studies. OSL dating of
sediments has provided SB ages ranging from 68.8  4.6 ka to
75.7  4.8 ka for Blombos Cave (Jacobs et al., 2013), 70.5  2.4 ka for
Sibudu Cave (Jacobs et al., 2008) and 70.5  4.7 ka for Umhlatuzana
Cave (Lombard et al., 2010). Using samples from multiple sites (but
including the erroneously assigned DRS sample), Jacobs et al. (2013)
constrain the SB to between 75.5 and 67.8 ka. OSL dating suggests
that HP assemblages at various sites accumulated between about
64.8 and 59.5 ka (Jacobs et al., 2008), which is consistent with
paleoenvironmental indications that associate the HP largely with
Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4 (Deacon, 1989). However, it may be
necessary to consider how this global cooling manifested itself
locally (Blome et al., 2012), and the available HP samples come from
multiple modern environmental zones (Jacobs et al., 2008). If all the
dates are taken at face value, they may imply that the SB and HP
overlapped extensively in time. However additional studies are
needed, especially OSL dating by multiple laboratories and the
extension of TL to other sites.

underlying MSA deposit. Radiocarbon placed the LSA occupation
between 1478  50 years cal BP (1590  45 14C-age BP) and
426  69 years cal BP (390  30 14C-age BP) (Parkington and
Poggenpoel, 1987).
Subsequent excavation, ﬁrst by the University of Cape Town
and from 1998 by a joint South AfricaneFrench team has focused
on the deeply stratiﬁed MSA sequence (Parkington et al., 2013).
The MSA deposits reach a depth of about 3.1 m and comprise
approximately 160 named stratigraphic units or “SU’s” that suggest persistent utilization with minimal signiﬁcant hiatuses
(Miller et al., 2013). Bone, shell, and well-preserved charcoal
occur more or less throughout. Differences in artifact typology

The excavators divided the shelter surface into 1  1 m squares,
most of which were further divided into quadrants. They excavated
with small trowels and brushes and removed the deposit according
to the natural stratigraphy. From 1998, when the French team
joined the excavation, ﬁnds with a dimension of >20 mm were
assigned individual numbers and plotted in three dimensions.
Smaller ﬁnds were recovered by square or quadrant from 5-mm
mesh screens. Bones and shells were separated from artifacts partly
in the ﬁeld and partly afterward at the University of Cape Town. We
analyzed the bones and shells yearly in the Iziko South African
Museum. The results reported here cover almost all items excavated through to November/December 2011.
The LSA bones and shells from the 1973 excavation are relatively
fresh looking and complete, but the overwhelming majority of MSA

specimens are small fragments that have been chemically altered in
the deposit. The MSA faunal remains were therefore much more
difﬁcult to analyze. However, we applied the same analytic protocol
to LSA and MSA specimens, and we examined any we could identify
below the level of Linnaean class for visible damage, which comprised mainly rodent and carnivore tooth marks, stone tool cut
marks, gastric-acid etching, and burning. For each mammalian
specimen that we could identify to the family level or below, we
recorded the skeletal part, and where relevant, its side, portion
(mainly proximal or distal), state of epiphyseal fusion, and again,
any visible surface damage (using a strong primary light source).
We entered the individual specimens into a database from which a
custom computer program calculated the Number of Identiﬁable
Specimens (NISP) per taxon and the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) they must represent (see Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1984
for details of how the calculations are made) within each artifactually deﬁned stratigraphic group. We quantiﬁed the tortoises
mainly from their distal humeri and femora, which we also measured to estimate median individual size in each stratigraphic group.
The intertidal shells were generally too fragmented to estimate
taxonomic abundance from counts, and for quantiﬁcation, we have
relied on weights.
3. Results
In our analysis, we have ignored a concentration of microfaunal
bones that occurred below a likely owl roost on and within an LSA
bedding patch in the northwestern corner of the shelter. The species remain unidentiﬁed, but M. Avery, reported in Parkington
(1987), found small rodents, insectivores, lizards, frogs, and small
passerine birds.
The LSA and MSA faunal samples we examined contain at least
40 taxa. Mammals dominate, but there are also tortoises, snakes,
birds (especially ostrich represented by eggshell), and intertidal
mollusks. To date, excluding ostrich eggshell, some of which is
decorated (Texier et al., 2013, 2010) and not part of our current
analysis, the specimens we identiﬁed include 4614 mammalian
bones, 2055 tortoise humeri, 1588 tortoise femora, 400 snake
vertebrae, eight bird bones, two ﬁsh bones, and 3.3 kg of intertidal
shell. The mammal total includes two MSA human phalanges and
an MSA human tooth that Verna et al. (2013) describe. The shell
weight is a slight underestimate, since it includes only pieces that
were separated before we received the fauna and excludes the
occasional pieces we encountered in our sorting. The present
analysis is based on only about 70% of the identiﬁed bones and
shells, since we could not assign the remaining 30% to one of the
nine successive culture-stratigraphic units listed previously. Some
of the unassigned items originate from cleanings or disturbances,
but the majority come from a part of the excavation to which the
current artifact-based stratigraphic scheme has yet to be applied.
It’s likely that most, if not all unassigned items from this part of
the site came from the broader Howiesons Poort complex.
3.1. Mammals
Analysis of the Diepkloof MSA mammal bones is challenging,
because most were fragmented, by burning and often subsequent
trampling, and chemically degraded in the deposit (see Miller et al.,
2013 for additional details). Fig. 2 illustrates two partial exceptions:
(2A) a small bovid (steenbok) mandible on which crystals have
formed, and (2B) a heavily leached, fragmentary large bovid (eland)
mandible. Many other bones were probably leached away entirely,
and like the specimen in Fig. 2B, those that remain were often
stained dark-brown or black by the surrounding sediment. Intact

teeth are particularly rare, because teeth were often shattered by
the growth of gypsum crystals.
3.1.1. Identiﬁcation and taxonomy
Table 1 lists the mammalian species that we identiﬁed, together
with the Number of Identiﬁed Specimens (NISP) we assigned to
each and the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) from which
the specimens must come. The table uses the taxonomic nomenclature in Skinner and Chimimba (2005). We provide Linnaean
names in the text only where they are not listed in the table.
African archaeological faunas often contain closely related
species that are difﬁcult to separate on bones alone, and extreme
fragmentation in the MSA layers exacerbates the problem for Diepkloof. Teeth show that multiple bovid species are represented, but
for the most part, we could assign fragmentary bovid postcranial
bones only to size categories. The categories are small, smallmedium, large-medium, and large, which we have employed in
the same way at other sites, including for example, Elands Bay Cave,
Sea Harvest, and Ysterfontein 1, to which we refer below. With
respect to the species identiﬁed at Diepkloof, small bovids include
steenbok, grysbok, and klipspringer; small-medium bovids include
sheep, springbok, southern reedbuck, and grey rhebuck; largemedium bovids include blue antelope and black wildebeest and/
or Cape hartebeest; and large bovids include eland and buffalo(s).
We could not always distinguish steenbok from grysbok, so Table 1
lists a composite category, Raphicerus spp., for specimens we could
identify to species and those we could not. The table lumps black
wildebeest and Cape hartebeest, because their worn teeth are
impossible to distinguish, but based on greater crown height, only
black wildebeest is represented among the few lightly worn
specimens. Between the two possible buffalo species, only the
extinct long-horned species is deﬁnitely present, but three dental
fragments could conceivably represent the extant Cape buffalo

(Syncerus caffer). Similarly, some of the smaller teeth or dental
fragments we assigned to eland might come from large kudu
(Tragelaphus strepsiceros). We identiﬁed sheep conclusively from
four horn core fragments. We saw no specimens of goat (Capra
hircus).
A similar problem of species identiﬁcation affects the rhinocerotids (rhinos), equids (“horses”) and leporids (hares). We could
not distinguish the fragmentary bones of rhinoceros between ones
that could come from black rhino (Diceros bicornis) and ones that
might represent white rhino (Ceratotherium simum). Only black
rhino was known nearby historically, but white rhino occurs in
other Western Cape Pleistocene sites. Dental and postcranial size
differences show that at least two equid species occur in the MSA
fauna and there could be three. Most of the identiﬁable specimens
are extremely large and must represent the Cape zebra (Equus
capensis), but some smaller elements could come from either
mountain zebra (Equus zebra) or quagga (Equus quagga). We have
therefore listed the smaller bones as E. zebra and/or E. quagga, and
we have lumped all equid bones e both those we could identify on
size and a number of fragments we could not e in a composite
equid category. Faced with extreme fragmentation and a lack of

dentitions, we have further lumped all the Diepkloof hare bones
into a leporid category, but they could variously represent Cape
hare (Lepus capensis), scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis), red rock rabbit
(Pronolagus rupestris), or least likely based on geography, riverine
rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis).
3.1.2. Bone damage and the collector(s)
Extensive post-depositional alteration impeded our attempt to
quantify bone damage, but we recorded occasional cut marks and
percussion notching from human butchery and marrow extraction.
Use-wear studies of a sample of Early HP artifacts also indicate their
involvement with animal butchery (Igreja and Porraz, 2013). Most
of the cut-marks were on bones of large-medium bovids: one from
the Intermediate HP (SU Fred), three from the SB (SUs Larry and
Kim), one from Mike (SU Lauren), and one from the Pre-SB (SU
Maggie). Cut marks also occurred on a large bovid bone from the
Late HP (SU Frans), on a bone of indeterminate taxon from the
Intermediate HP (SU OB3) and one from Jack (SU Jack), and on a
jackal ulna from the Intermediate HP (SU Fred). The latter is noteworthy, since cut-marked carnivore bones are rare in MSA
assemblages. We also observed numerous apparently burned

T.E. Steele, R.G. Klein / Journal of Archaeological Science 40 (2013) 3453e3462

bones, but we offer no numbers, because we had difﬁculty consistently distinguishing burning from the dark staining that the
bones commonly acquired in the deposit. However, Diepkloof
preserves abundant evidence of hearths, visible in both the macroand micro-stratigraphy (Miller et al., 2013).
We found no carnivore chewed bones, but we observed apparent gastric acid damage on three small bovid elements from the
Intermediate HP (SUs OB4, OB5 and John), one from the Post-HP
(SU Becky), and one from Jack (SU Jack), on a leporid bone from
Mike (SU Mike), on a hyrax bone from the SB (SU Logan), and on a
large-medium bovid specimen from the LSA (SU Below Bedding K).
In addition, six coprolites from the Post-HP levels (four in SU Gladys, two in SU Hearth below Gladys) and one from the Early HP (SU
Julia) demonstrate that hyenas visited the shelter. Since carnivore
bones, especially ones from jackals and from hyenas themselves,
tend to be common where hyenas were active bone accumulators
(Cruz-Uribe, 1991), the infrequency of jackal and hyena elements
(Fig. 3 and Table 1) suggests that hyena visits to Diepkloof were
occasional and short-lived, and we conclude that people introduced most bones of larger animals. We cannot rule out that raptors introduced many bones from smaller species, especially hares,
dune mole rats, and hyraxes. Raptor digestion could explain the
acid etching on the leporid bone and even some of the small bovid
bones, and raptor as opposed to human (MSA) collection must be
particularly considered where bones of small species dominate, as
in the Pre-SB. The low density of lithic material and microstratigraphic analysis of the deepest deposits supports a minimal
role for humans in accumulating these materials (Miller et al., 2013,
Porraz et al., 2013).
3.1.3. Paleoenvironment
Based on NISPs, Fig. 3 summarizes the taxonomic composition
of the Diepkloof mammal fauna in comparison to the fauna from

3457

terminal Pleistocene and Holocene LSA layers at Elands Bay Cave
(Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1987), which is located in a similar setting
near the mouth of the Verlorenvlei. The ﬁgure shows that the
Diepkloof and Elands Bay faunas have much in common, including
the shared abundance of small bovids and the consistent presence
of hares, dune mole rats, and hyraxes. The dune mole rats
underscore the shared proximity of sandy soils, and hyraxes (along
with baboons, klipspringer, and grey rhebuck) of rocky slopes.
Hares appear to be more numerous at Diepkloof. We noted previously that extreme bone fragmentation prevented us from
identifying hares below the family level, but an often grassier
environment at Diepkloof may have particularly favored one or
more species. The consistent presence of water-dependent species,
such as hippopotamus, in the Diepkloof assemblage highlights the
proximity and persistence of the nearby vlei, where the human
inhabitants exploited both faunal and ﬂoral resources (Cartwright,
2013).
Overall, the Diepkloof and Elands Bay faunas differ most conspicuously in the much higher frequency of seals at Elands Bay. The
difference was expected, since Elands Bay is currently only 200 m
from the sea, and 11 ka, when seal bones began to accumulate
there, it was probably no more than 4 km. In contrast, the coast was
surely always much further from Diepkloof, and it is perhaps surprising that Diepkloof has provided any seal bones at all. The
majority (NISP ¼ 26) come from the LSA deposit, but there are also
two from the Late HP (SUs Darryl and Hearth below Eve) and one
from the Intermediate HP (SU John). If the OSL dates for the HP
complex are accepted, the seal bones arrived during MIS 4, when
sea level was probably at least as low as it was 11 ka, and the coast
would have been 18 km or more to the west.
So far, the SB layers have provided no seal bones, but they have
produced two dolphin vertebrae (SU Maria). The SB deposits
probably formed during MIS 5 when sea levels were as high or

higher than today. This may sometimes have encouraged dolphins
and other marine species to enter the coastal lake, and dolphins
could have become stranded on its shore.
For additional comparisons, it is important to emphasize a signiﬁcant taxonomic contrast between the late Holocene sample
from Elands Bay (labeled “AeC” in Fig. 3) and the terminal Pleistocene/early Holocene sample (labeled “D”) (Klein and Cruz-Uribe,
1987). The late Holocene sample is taxonomically identical to the
Diepkloof LSA sample, with which it overlaps in time. Both are
notable for the presence of domestic sheep bones dated to as much
as 1500 years ago, and both contain only indigenous species that
were recorded nearby historically. In contrast, the older Elands Bay
sample and the Diepkloof MSA sample contain ungulates that were
rare or unknown in the region historically. At both sites, these are
the Cape zebra, blue antelope, southern reedbuck, and black
wildebeest, supplemented at Diepkloof by the long-horned
(“giant”) buffalo. The latest known occurrence of Cape zebra is at
Elands Bay in a layer dated to about 11,000 years cal BP (9600 14Cage BP) (Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1987). The long-horned buffalo
disappeared elsewhere in southern Africa about the same time or a
little earlier (Klein, 1994), and its absence at Elands Bay may reﬂect
only the small size of the terminal Pleistocene/early Holocene
ungulate sample. The extralimital and extinct species were all
obligate grazers, and combined with the relative abundance of
extant equids, they suggest that by Holocene standards, grasses
were signiﬁcantly more abundant near Elands Bay and Diepkloof in
the late Pleistocene. If this is accepted, the relatively large number
of teeth from grazing ungulates in the Diepkloof Post-HP layers
may imply especially grassy conditions. OSL dates suggest the PostHP deposits accumulated after 60 ka, early in MIS 3 (Jacobs et al.,
2008).
An increased abundance of grazing ungulates, including the
same extralimital and extinct species identiﬁed in the Diepkloof
MSA and Elands Bay terminal Pleistocene samples, characterizes all
other known Western Cape Pleistocene faunas, including both
those from “glacial” sites (like Swartklip (Klein, 1983), Spreeuwalle
(Klein et al., 2007), the Elandsfontein Bone Circle (Klein, 1983)) and
“interglacial” sites (like Duinefontein 2 (Cruz-Uribe et al., 2003) and
Elandsfontein Main (Klein et al., 2007)). At the glacial sites, the
greater role of grasses may mainly reﬂect reduced evaporation, but
at the interglacial sites, it must reﬂect higher rainfall. In either case,
the difference from the Holocene is striking, and it implies that the
Western Cape has been unusually dry during the Holocene, perhaps
because it has been unusually warm.
The woody plants identiﬁed from MSA charcoals at Diepkloof
(Cartwright, 2013) and from terminal Pleistocene charcoals at
Elands Bay (Cartwright and Parkington, 1997) conﬁrm that precipitation was generally greater or more effective, and the large
average size of dune mole rats in the terminal Pleistocene/early
Holocene deposits of Elands Bay provides additional support. This
follows from the observation that average size in recent dune mole
rats increases with rainfall (Klein, 1991). At Diepkloof, dune mole
rat bones are too rare in most artifactually deﬁned units to estimate
average size, but in the SB complex and superjacent Mike where
they are sufﬁciently common, they appear to have been intermediate in size between the large terminal Pleistocene/early Holocene specimens and the much smaller late Holocene specimens at
Elands Bay (Fig. 4). This suggests that the Pre-SB units accumulated
at a time (probably during a portion of MIS 5) when rainfall was less
than in the terminal Pleistocene/early Holocene but greater than in
the late Holocene.
In sum, the Diepkloof mammals suggest that the late Holocene
(LSA) environment differed little if at all from the historic one, but
that the late Pleistocene (MSA) environment was signiﬁcantly
grassier, because precipitation was higher, more effective, or both.

1993), and two composite successive LSA occupation episodes at Elands Bay Cave
(Parkington, 1981, 1987) and Tortoise Cave (Robey, 1987): EBC/TC C ¼ Elands Bay Cave
layers 6e9 plus Tortoise Cave layers 5e13A and EBC/TC D ¼ Elands Bay Cave layers 10e
19 plus Tortoise Cave layer 14. Solid circles and triangles mark humeri from modern
mole rat females and males respectively. The parentheses following the site names
contain the numbers of measured humeri, followed by their estimated ages. The key
elements in each boxplot are the median, represented by the line near the center of
each plot; the open rectangle which encloses the middle half of the data (between the
25th and 75th percentiles); the shaded rectangle which indicates the 95% conﬁdence
limits for the median; and the line bisecting each plot, which signiﬁes the range of
more or less continuous data. Starbursts and open circles mark outliers (values that are
especially far from the median). Chance is unlikely to explain the difference between
medians whose 95% conﬁdence limits do not overlap. Samples whose conﬁdence limits
lie above the upper conﬁdence limit for the regression line imply higher-thanexpected rainfall; samples whose conﬁdence limits lie below the lower limit imply
lower-than-expected rainfall.

3.2. Tortoises and turtles
Tortoise bones abound at Diepkloof. The small number of carapace fragments that can be identiﬁed to species come mainly from
the angulate tortoise (Chersina angulata), which has probably long
been common nearby. Two limb bones in the Late HP (SUs Frans
and E1), two in the Intermediate HP (SUs John and Jeff), and one in
the Early HP (SU Jess) document the marsh terrapin or helmeted
turtle (Pelomedusa subrufa), an indication that the Diepkloof people
also exploited the nearby vlei.
At other Western Cape sites, MSA angulate tortoises tend to be
signiﬁcantly larger than their LSA counterparts, probably because
MSA people were generally less numerous and exploited tortoises
less intensively (Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1983; Steele and Klein, 2005/
06). Fig. 5 shows that the tortoises from roughly the upper half of
the DRS sequence, beginning with Jack, are large like other MSA
specimens, but those from further down are not and those from the
SB and Lynn are especially small. One possible explanation, also
perhaps implied by the exceptional abundance of mole rat and
snake bones in SB and Lynn, is that a large raptor or other nonhuman agent introduced many of the tortoises to these units.

attributed to the LSA, but neither has been identiﬁed to species. The
MSA deposits have so far yielded no ﬁsh bones, perhaps because
the peculiar geochemical circumstances of MSA deposits destroyed
them. However, ﬁsh bones also tend to be rare or absent in other
MSA deposits where bone is much better preserved (Klein et al.,
2004).

Cave (TC) (Robey, 1987). EBC/TC A ¼ Elands Bay Cave layers 1e4 and Tortoise Cave
layers 1e2A; EBC/TC B ¼ Elands Bay Cave 5 and Tortoise Cave 2B-4; EBC/TC C ¼ Elands
Bay Cave 6e9 and Tortoise Cave 5e13A; EBC/TC D ¼ Elands Bay Cave 10e19 and
Tortoise Cave 14. The caption to Fig. 3 explains the boxplot format.

The initial LSA excavation recovered 17 “mandibles” (chelipeds)
of rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) and more than 4.5 kg of wellpreserved intertidal mollusk shell, mostly from black mussel
(Choromytilus meridionalis) and granite limpet (Cymbula granatina)
(Parkington and Poggenpoel, 1987). Our reexamination provided
MNIs of 142 for the mussels and 31 for the limpets. Both species
are characteristic of rocky shores, and their quantity, both absolutely and relative to mammal bones, is impressive since they had
to be transported at least 14 km. Shellﬁsh ﬂesh turns rancid within
a few hours, which means the trip had to be made quickly. The
shells show no alterations to suggest they were sought for artifacts
as opposed to food. The explanation for the unexpected result may
be that the lake shore provided an especially easy route to the
coast.
Like LSA tortoises, LSA limpets tend to be signiﬁcantly smaller
than their MSA counterparts, probably again because LSA populations were larger and pressed harder on limpet populations
(Avery et al., 2008; Klein, 1979; Steele and Klein, 2008). Only the
Diepkloof LSA deposits have provided measurable limpets, but
these can be compared to limpets from various nearby coastal MSA
sites. At Diepkloof and most other local sites, granite limpets tend to
dominate the limpet sample, and Fig. 6 shows that the Diepkloof
LSA granite limpets conform to advance size expectations. They are
similar in average size to those from other regional LSA sites and

3.3. Other vertebrates
All Diepkloof units contain snake vertebrae, but they are especially common in Lynn (NISP ¼ 25), Mike (NISP ¼ 23), and the
succeeding SB (NISP ¼ 139). We could not identify any to species,
but based on size and geography, they are most likely to come from
mole snake (Pseudaspis cana), puff adder (Bitis arietans), or Cape
cobra (Naja nivea). An Early HP unit (SU Kenny) provided a single
vertebra of monitor lizard (Varanus sp.).
We found few bird bones. Raptors are represented by two bones
from the Late HP (SU Frans) and one from the Intermediate HP (SU
Fiona). Probable francolins (Francolinus sp(p).) are represented by
one bone each from Lynn (SU Lynn), the Intermediate-HP (SU Jeff),
and the Post-HP (SU Hearth below Becky). We also observed a
fragmentary femur from penguin (Spheniscus demersus) in a unit
(SU Gwen) that probably belongs within the HP complex broadly
deﬁned. To these, should be added a single element of Cape cormorant (Phalocrocorax capensis) from the initial LSA excavation
(Parkington and Poggenpoel, 1987).
Poggenpoel (1987) identiﬁed a small number of ﬁsh bones from
the initial LSA excavation to white steenbras (Lithognathus lithognathus) and ﬂathead mullet (Mugil cephalus). Steenbras was more
common, and it could have been caught in the nearby lake, even
though it is primarily a saltwater ﬁsh. We observed two additional
ﬁsh bones from deposits that the joint South AfricaneFrench team

(Avery et al., 2008) and Sea Harvest (Volman, 1978). The LSA samples span the Holocene, from roughly 11 ka to 0.4 ka. The MSA samples probably date mainly, if not
entirely from the MIS 5 (the Last Interglacial) between 115 and 71 ka. The caption to
Fig. 3 explains the boxplot format.

signiﬁcantly smaller than those from local MSA sites. The LSA and
MSA sites for comparison were chosen for display purposes only
and other sites reveal the same pattern (see other examples in
Steele and Klein, 2008).
Both absolutely and relative to mammal bones, the Diepkloof
MSA deposits have provided a substantial quantity of highly
fragmented, leached intertidal shell, particularly from the Late HP
and Post-HP units (Table 2 and Fig. 7). The original amount was
surely much greater, and it might have equaled or exceeded the
amount in the LSA. Most of the readily identiﬁable MSA pieces
represent black mussels and granite limpets, but there are also
fragments of white mussels (Donax serra), granular limpets (Scutellastra granularis), Argenville’s limpets (Scutellastra argenvillei),
barnacles (Buccinidae), triton (Argobuccinum pustulorum), and
dogwhelks (Burnupena/Nucella). In addition, three Diepkloof MSA
units provided whale barnacles (Coronula sp(p).) e a complete
specimen from the Intermediate HP (SU Fiona; Fig. 8) and one
fragment each from the Late HP (SU Debbie) and Post-HP (SU
Donovan). Whale barnacles have also been recognized in MSA
deposits at the Ysterfontein 1 Rock Shelter (Avery et al., 2008) and
Pinnacle Point Cave 13B (Jerardino and Marean, 2010) and in
various LSA sites (Jerardino and Parkington, 1993; Kandel and

Conard, 2003). Everywhere, they imply scavenging of beached
whales, probably mostly the humpback whale (Megaptera
novaeangliae) and the southern right whale (Eubalaena australis),
both of which are particularly common in the waters off the
Western Cape.
The abundant MSA shell may mean that like their LSA successors, the MSA occupants of Diepkloof discovered they could
reach the coast quickly along the shore of the lake. Even if this is
true, however, it’s puzzling that shell is particularly abundant in
the Late HP and Post-HP units, which probably formed at a time
when the coast was especially distant (during MIS 4 and early MIS
3), and not in the SB units, which probably formed when the sea
was closer (during MIS 5). One possible explanation is that postdepostional leaching and compaction removed progressively
greater amounts of shell from the older MSA deposits. If so,
however, it did not lead to conspicuous differences in the quality
of shell or bone preservation between the bottom and top of the
sequence. Another possibility, for which the excavators see no
evidence, is that much of the shell near the top of the sequence
was admixed from LSA scufﬁng and trampling or from bedding
hollows or pits like those were seen to intrude the MSA deposits in
the initial excavation.

4. Conclusions
Diepkloof Rock Shelter has provided bones and shells from an
LSA occupation that dates between roughly 1500 and 425 years ago
and from a deeply stratiﬁed MSA sequence that probably formed
from 100,000 years ago or before until 60,000 years ago or later.
Within the MSA sequence, the excavators have recognized nine
successive artifactually deﬁned complexes, most notably including
the Still Bay toward the bottom and variants of the Howiesons Poort
toward the top. Our study reported here was based on the 70% of
the faunal sample that could be associated with these nine
complexes.
Analysis of the MSA bones is challenging, because leaching and
post-depositional crystal-growth have reduced most pieces to
small fragments. This impedes quantiﬁcation of pre-depositional
damage and thus our ability to identify the bone collector(s).
However, we conclude tentatively that people were the principal
accumulators in most units. Coprolites suggest that hyenas may
have introduced some bones, but the assemblage contains few of
the hyena and jackal bones that tend to mark hyena dens, and this
suggests that hyena visits were brief. It is more difﬁcult to rule out a
signiﬁcant contribution by large raptors, particularly to units like
those near the bottom of the sequence in which small mammals are
especially abundant. A raptor contribution could explain why the
tortoises in these units are as small or smaller than those in local
LSA occupations. At other sites, MSA tortoises tend to be signiﬁcantly larger than LSA specimens, probably because MSA populations were less dense and pressed on tortoises less intensively.
The tortoises from the upper part of the Diepkloof MSA occupation
are large and thus conform to expectations drawn from other MSA
sites.
Taxonomically, the LSA and MSA samples are similar in their
shared abundance of small antelopes, hares, dune mole rats,
hyraxes, tortoises, and intertidal shell. The vertebrates imply a
substantial degree of long-term environmental continuity. However, unlike the LSA sample, which comprises only species that
occurred nearby historically, including domestic sheep that were
probably introduced locally by 1800 years ago, the MSA samples
include ﬁve regionally or totally extinct grazing ungulates e Cape
zebra, blue antelope, southern reedbuck, black wildebeest, and
long-horned buffalo e that are unknown from any regional Holocene site. The extralimital and extinct grazers imply that grasses
played a greater role in the Pleistocene vegetation. The same
grazing species characterize all regional Pleistocene fossil sites,
both “glacial” and “interglacial” as determined by dating, geomorphic context, or both. A greater role for grasses implies that the
Western Cape was commonly moister in the Pleistocene, possibly
due to reduced evaporation under glacial conditions and certainly
to increased rainfall under interglacial conditions. Conversely, a
more limited role for grasses suggests that the Western Cape has
been unusually dry in the Holocene, perhaps because it has been
unusually warm.
The moderately large average size of dune mole rats from the
near the base of the Diepkloof MSA sequence conﬁrms relatively
moist conditions, probably during a portion of the Last Interglacial
(MIS 5). Larger samples of dune mole rat bones might allow us to
track humidity through the MSA sequence.
The most surprising aspect of the Diepkloof fauna is probably
the abundance of intertidal shell throughout. The site was 14 km
from the coast during the LSA occupation, and it was probably often
further when MSA people were present; prehistoric people rarely
moved mollusks that far. The distribution of shell within the MSA
sequence is particularly puzzling, since it is least abundant near the
bottom in layers that are most likely to have formed under interglacial conditions when the coast was closest, and most abundant

3461

near the top in layers that probably formed under glacial conditions
when the coast was especially distant. Although the preservation of
shell and bone does not change conspicuously with depth, progressive post-depositional leaching might explain why shell is less
abundant near the bottom than near the top.
