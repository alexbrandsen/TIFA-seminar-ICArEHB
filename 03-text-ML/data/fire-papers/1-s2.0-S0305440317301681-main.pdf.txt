Faecal spherulites are a common indicator of dung in archaeological deposits and most of the basic
processes of their formation and taphonomy have been explained. However, a darkened form is also
regularly found, ranging from slightly transparent through to completely opaque. These have been less
well studied, so we set out here to understand what actually causes the darkening and to determine the
range of conditions required to produce the changes.
Darkened spherulites were successfully created by heating dung to between 500  C and 700  C with
the gaseous products constrained. The maximum production in our experiments was at 600  C. The
darkened spherulites often expanded during the alteration process and some of the expanded ones
become distorted. SEM examination was only possible through destructive preparation processes, but
examples were found showing expansion beyond the normal size range. These had a distinctive internal
structure characterised by very ﬁne crystallinity and larger scale fracturing, perhaps resulting from
organic matter loss and/or CaCO3 alteration. Prolonged oxidative heating failed to remove the darkening,
leading to the possibility that it is partly a structural phenomenon, with opaciﬁcation arising from
compound relief.
Based on these ﬁndings, darkened spherulites can now be conﬁdently interpreted as; resulting from
dung being heated in conditions of limited gaseous exchange to between 500 and 700  C, then not
heated again beyond ca. 700  C. These sorts of conditions could occur, around the edge of, or beneath,
any ﬁre where fresh dung is being burned or where the existing stratigraphy has a dung component.

1. Introduction
Faecal spherulites are very small (typically 5e20 mm), approximately spherical, radially crystallised bodies of calcium carbonate
produced in the digestion of various mammals, but particularly the
ruminant herbivores (Brochier, 1983; Brochier et al., 1992; Canti,
1997). They are now a widely-used indicator of herbivore presence in archaeology, mostly in caves and rock shelters of the
Mediterranean region (e.g. Brochier, 2002; Karkanas, 2006;
Angelucci et al., 2009; Polo-Díaz, 2010), but also open air sites
where burial has been rapid or the surrounding sediments are
suitably alkaline (Brochier, 1984; Matthews et al., 1996; ShahackGross et al., 2014). Spherulite production and preservation is,

however, clearly a global phenomenon and they have been reported from other parts of Eurasia (Matthews and Postgate, 1994;
Matthews et al., 1996; Castel et al., 2008; Badalyan et al., 2010),
from Africa (Cremaschi and Trombino, 1999; Shahack-Gross et al.,
2003) and from South America (Korstanje, 2002; Coil et al., 2003).
They are increasingly being used within ethnoarchaeological
studies (see review in Friesem, 2016) to provide numerical data,
which can be combined with phytolith or archaeobotanical evidence in order to make deductions concerning husbandry, seasonality, dung usage and domestic activities (Cabanes et al., 2007;
Portillo and Albert, 2011; Elliott et al., 2015; Gur-Arieh et al.,
2013, 2014; Portillo et al., 2014; Portillo et al., 2017).
Most of the basic processes of spherulite formation and
taphonomy are well-understood (Brochier et al., 1992; Canti, 1998,
1999; Shahack-Gross, 2011; Canti and Brochier, 2017). One aspect
that is less clear, however, is their occurrence in a darkened or
opaque form. Darkened spherulites were ﬁrst described in layers of
burnt manure from sub-recent deposits in a series of caves in Sicily

(Brochier et al., 1992). In related experimental work, the darkening
was replicated by burning sheep dung in an oxidising atmosphere
at 500  C (Brochier, 1996, 2002). According to the author, the
darkening resulted from carbonisation of the internal organic
component of the spherulites. There are various other references to
darkened or opaque spherulites from archaeological contexts.

Brochier (1993) reported them from the Neolithic tell of Çayo
(Turkey); they were observed by Iaconis and Boschian (2007) in
one of the caves of Sant’Angelo (late Neolithic) and in Grotta dei
Piccioni (early/middle Neolithic and Bronze age deposits) in central
Italy. In both these cases the darkening of spherulites was interpreted as the result of dung burning. They were also mentioned in
discussions of ash deposits at the tell of Al-Rawda (West-Central
Syria) in Castel et al. (2008), and Polo Díaz et al. (2014) illustrated
examples from early prehistoric burnt dung deposits of Cova Gran
de Santa Linya (Spain).
1.1. What do darkened spherulites look like?
Ordinary spherulites are fundamentally transparent in plane
polarised light (PPL), but the view frequently includes structural
planes and organic matter which produce some internal relief and
colouring. Under crossed polarised light (XPL), the tiny radial
crystals are all in extinction when lying in the north, south, east and
west directions, producing a dark cross which remains in position
as the microscope stage is rotated. Elsewhere, the crystals not lying
in these cardinal positions show interference colours arising from
the strong birefringence of calcium carbonate. Thus, even a
spherulite as small as 5 mm will show ﬁrst order white between the
limbs of the extinction cross.
Darkened spherulites in PPL (Figs. 1a and 2a) are somewhere in a
range between brown and slightly transparent through to black
and completely opaque. In most cases, the brown or black

33

colouration takes up almost the whole sphere, with just a small
clear fringe left at the perimeter. Occasionally, however, the dark
sector occupies only the middle portion of the spherulite and tends
then to be obscured by the extinction cross in XPL.
Darkened spherulites are frequently larger than ordinary
spherulites, regularly being up to 25 mm in size and occasionally
more. However, this is not always the case, and many darkened
spherulites’ diameters fall within the same size range as ordinary
ones. These observations mean that some or all of them must
expand during the darkening process. Although they are often
nearly opaque in XPL (Figs. 1b and 2b), if the microscope light
source is raised to high levels of brightness, the interference colours
and extinction cross can still be seen, albeit obscured by the brown
tone (Brochier, 2002). At the very edge, where the browning is not
present, the perimeter fringe shows the normal interference
pattern of spherulites. If a l plate is inserted (Fig. 2c), this thin band
displays the blue and yellow of the pseudo-uniaxial negative ﬁgure
described in Canti (1998). Clearly then, although some (or all) of the
darkened spherulites undergo expansion, the overall radial structure is not changed by the darkening process.
In addition, a small percentage of the darkened spherulites
become distinctly non-circular and instead display distorted, often
lobed shapes (Fig. 3). Many ordinary spherulites are already bilobate due to their crystal layout. In the crystallographic and biomineralogical literature, a successively inﬁlling dumbbell shape
(also known amongst crystallographers as “wheatsheaf” when
elongated) is widely viewed as the true growth pattern of spherulitic crystallisation (Morse and Donnay, 1936; Keller and Waring,
1955; Keller, 1958; Keith and Padden, 1963; Hartshorne and
Stuart, 1970; Hutter and Bechhoefer, 2000; Chen et al., 2006;
Beck and Andreassen, 2010; see also Fig. 2 in Canti, 1998). Whilst
this dumbbell is growing, a spherulite at the right orientation will
often show the characteristic shape (e.g. Fig. 12f). Once the full

sphere has been produced, however, the developmental origin may
no longer be visible.
This morphological characteristic of normal spherulites makes it
difﬁcult to quantify the distortion rate, because some dumbbellshaped spherulites already show a lobed morphology depending
on the angle they are resting at in the microscope slide. However,
an estimate is that around 2e5% of darkened spherulites show the
distortions, and they appear to be the ones that have enlarged the
most.
1.2. Research rationale
The key issue for microscopists recording darkened spherulites
in liquid mounts or thin sections is to know what they mean for site
interpretation. We therefore set out to understand what actually
causes the spherulites’ darkening including their expansion and
distortion, and to determine the range of conditions required to
produce the changes. Based on this information, it should be
possible to determine how subsequent natural or anthropogenic
processes are likely to affect the preservation of darkened
spherulites.
2. Producing darkened spherulites e methods and results
Samples of fresh dung were collected from both sheep and goat
at the Archeopercorso Bostel di Rotzo, Vicenza, Italy. They were
dried and examined for spherulite content, then high yielding ones
were used either individually or amalgamated in all the

experiments described below. The experimentation was iterative
and went through three distinct stages, of which the ﬁrst two need
only summarising.
2.1. Whole faecal pellets
Initially, whole spherulite-rich faecal pellets from both goat and
sheep were burnt in small pots (Carbolite furnace RWF 12/13), then
thin sectioned according to standard methods for soil micromorphology (Murphy, 1986). A range of temperatures and burn durations was tested to see if there was a simple relationship. As
expected, lower temperatures (ca. 200e400  C) mostly had no effect and higher temperatures (700  C and above) routinely
destroyed the spherulites, producing isotropic morphologies (CaO
is isotropic) in the pellet remains, which required a period of
recarbonation in air to develop birefringence again. In these cases,
the original spherulites were no longer visible, being replaced by a
wide variety of CaCO3 neoformations. In the key temperature range
of 400  Ce700  C, high variability was found. Sometimes darkened
spherulites were abundantly produced (see Fig. 1), but other times
either incomplete combustion or complete destruction occurred in
similar repeat experiments, or even at different places within one
pellet in the same experiment. Attempts were made to overcome
the variability by averaging large areas through image analysis, but
the results were inconsistent.
The conclusion of these experiments was that a single faecal
pellet will always reach a variety of temperatures unrelated to the
measured temperature of the furnace, because of small variations

and temperatures. The isotropy results from conversion to CaO.

in the organic matter content and porosity, as well as local air
currents inside the furnace, all of which lead to unpredictable or
patchy ignition.
2.2. Ground faecal pellets spread out
In order to overcome the variable combustion problem, dryground <125 mm spherulite-rich faecal material was scattered
thinly onto a microscope slide and heated slowly so that oxidation
was uniform and ignition minimised, thus avoiding patchy overheating. The slide was then examined by using a drop of refractive
liquid (rather than cutting a thin section) either immediately, or
after a period of recarbonation in a moist atmosphere. This method
appeared to produce consistent, uniform heating, but failed to
produce darkened spherulites in anything other than very small
numbers. Additionally, it regularly caused conversion of the
spherulites to CaO within a repeatable range of temperatures and
times (Figs. 4 and 5).
The conclusion of these experiments was that the darkening of
the spherulites might be something occurring in a phase of
reduction (similar to the charring of plant matter) and that this
highly oxidising method was simply burning off the organic
framework of the spherulites too quickly. In order to routinely
produce darkened spherulites, the experiments had, therefore, to
both avoid overheating (due to ignition) and maintain reducing
conditions.

35

put the burning material in a container so that the CO2 produced by
combustion (which is heavier than air) sits on top of the charring
material instead of being removed by air currents within the
furnace. The container size and the level to which it is ﬁlled could
clearly affect the degree of reduction, so a number of types were
tested, all based on various small glass tubes available in the laboratory. They were 4, 10 and 15 mm diameter and all about 10 mm
high. Dried, ground, <125 mm spherulite-rich faecal material was
added in various quantities ranging from a tiny ~3 mm diameter
cone of powder sitting on the base of a pot through to half-ﬁlling
the pots. These different pot size/ﬁll types were tested as replicates of the temperature/time experiments described below. They
produced relatively small variation, and tubes of 4 mm (diameter) x
25 mm long were chosen and then used for all the subsequent
temperature experiments described in this paper. To improve
repeatability, a similar quantity of dung powder (ca. 10 mm3) was
always used, and a metal rod almost exactly the same diameter as
the pot was inserted after the dung powder (Fig. 6). This helped
prevent any stray draughts entering from above.
The tubes were warmed up for 20 min to get to temperature,
ﬁred for the speciﬁed period, then cooled naturally (typically
45e80 min) to get them back below 300  C (thus preventing any
further oxidation). On removal from the furnace, they were given
5 min resting to get down to handling temperature. All through the
time of heating and cooling, the tubes were kept upright to promote retention of CO2 in the pot.
3. Examining darkened spherulites e methods and results
3.1. Distinguishing darkened spherulites by light microscopy
The ashed dung powder from the burns carried out in small
tubes was dispersed in Cargille Meltmount and coverslipped to
make permanent slides. Spherulites were examined in PPL and XPL
on an Olympus BH2 microscope with or without l plate. For each

The simplest way to achieve a partially reduced atmosphere is to

time/temperature combination, 1000 spherulites were counted on
the slide at 200 magniﬁcation (with occasional examination at
400) and designated to either darkened or normal. As described
above, darkening usually takes up almost the whole sphere, with
just a small clear fringe left at the perimeter. These examples clearly

fall into the 'darkened' category. Occasionally, however, the dark
sector occupies only the middle portion of the spherulite, or the
dark areas are complex and incomplete. In these situations, we
counted as darkened only those spherulites whose total dark area
was large enough to cover half or more of the spherulite's overall

diameter. This notional dividing line coincides roughly with the
ability to see some darkening under XPL as well as PPL. If a central
dark area is smaller than half the overall diameter it tends to be
obscured by the extinction cross; if larger, the impression produced

37

is that the central junction of the extinction cross has an area of
swelling extending into each of the quadrants. Examples of
spherulites meeting or not meeting the criteria for being darkened
are shown in Fig. 7.
3.2. Percentage darkened at different temperatures and times
Table 1 shows the results of timed burns in the small blocked
tubes (see the experimental diagram in Fig. 6). This has produced a
very clear pattern of increasing darkened spherulite production
with greater time and temperature up to a maximum at 600  C for
6 h (Fig. 8). Additional time or higher temperatures thereafter, do
not produce greater numbers of darkened spherulites.
3.3. Size distribution
Size distributions of 565 unheated spherulites were measured,
as well as 1489 spherulites from the sample heated at 600  C for
6 h. ImageJ software (https://imagej.net/) was used to measure the
diameter of each spherulite visible in a series of photomicrographs
taken at 200 magniﬁcation.
Although this is only a single data set, general conclusions can
be drawn without claiming statistical rigour. The size distribution
curves in Fig. 9 clearly show that, on average, under a heating
regime of 600  C for 6 h with gases constrained, spherulites expand
and the distribution of their sizes becomes broader. Unheated
spherulites were mostly (83%) clustered in the 3e8 mm range, with
an average diameter of 5.2 mm (st. dev. 1.7), whereas heated but
undarkened spherulites lay instead mostly (78%) in the range between 6 mm and 12 mm with an average diameter of 9.3 mm (st. dev.
2.8). As they expand, some spherulites undergo additional changes
rendering them darker and these changes are associated with even

greater expansion. Darkened spherulites were mostly (75%) clustered in the range between 12 mm and 19 mm, with an average
diameter of 14.8 mm (st. dev. 3.5). Moreover, darkened spherulites
reached sizes (21e27 mm) that the heated but undarkened ones
never attained in these samples.
Since we cannot follow individuals through the heating process,
we only have this size distribution data to assess the nature of the
expansion. The curves in Fig. 9 would seem to result from all the
spherulites having expanded on heating, making the tiniest ones
move into the heated but undarkened size range and those that
were largest before heating move into the larger size ranges.
Whether or not this is the right interpretation of the curves, it is
clear that many heated spherulites showed large size increases
when they were darkened. Microscopic observation conﬁrms this;
they were regularly found to be double the size of heated undarkened spherulites and sometimes more.
3.4. Mineralogy
X ray diffraction was carried out on the raw dung powder and on
the sample heated at 600  C for 7 h. The results (Fig. 10) show
clearly that the dung is rich in calcite and quartz both before and
after burning. No other calcium carbonate polymorphs were found.
3.5. SEM morphology
In order to understand the expansion phenomenon associated
with darkening, it is necessary to see ordinary and darkened
spherulites under the SEM, either as whole objects or cut through

to make cross-sections. This is difﬁcult to achieve, due to a coating
of organic material (or oxidised derivatives from it) which is
invariably present on the outside.
Various preparation methods were tested with the aim of
uncovering the spherulites’ mineral component including heat
treatment and hydrogen peroxide, but the surface coating
remained stubbornly present obscuring the morphology (Fig. 11).
An alternative approach was tried in which <125 mm spheruliterich dung was given prolonged heating to various temperatures
between 400 and 650  C in order to reduce the organic matter as
much as possible; then the whole mass repeatedly chopped (on the
slide) with a fresh scalpel blade. The slide was attached to an SEM
stub, surrounded with silver dag in order to earth it, and the top
side gold-coated. This successfully produced a few cross sections
(Fig. 12 a e e), but they were very scarce on the slide, relying as they
did on occasional chance interactions of the blade and a spherulite
at the right angle to produce a possible shear (Fig. 12e), or to rip
apart the two halves of the dumbbell (Fig. 12b, c and d).
Another method involved scattering the same type of burnt
dung powder onto a sticky tape, pressing a second piece of tape
onto it (sandwiching the powder in between), and then ripping
them apart (black SEM discs were tried and also proprietary decorators’ edging tape which has a weaker glue). No systematic
variation with temperature or tape-type was found, but this
approach generally produced signiﬁcantly larger numbers of
spherulites with the structure displayed (Fig. 13 a - f).
Uncovering and morphological exposure of spherulite structure
was only achievable by these destructive preparation approaches
followed by examination of the debris.

Fig. 10. X ray diffraction results from the dung powder (A) unheated and (B) heated to 700  C for 6 h. Calcite and quartz are the main constituents in both cases, with additional
peaks probably from incidental materials ingested by the animals - aluminium phosphate (21.5 in A) and carbonate hydroxylapatite (31.9 in B). A likely candidate for the small peak
at 27.6 in A has not been found.

The techniques failed when tried on unheated spherulites,
presumably as a result of protection by the coating, so we still have
no SEM image of the unheated internal structure.
In order to identify a darkened spherulite, we had to rely on the
size and morphology of the product, rather than being able to take a
proven dark spherulite through from polarised light to the electron
beam. Eventually, using one of our highest-yielding experimental
residues (600  C for 8 h) pulled apart with tapes, a few examples
were found with the enlarged and expanded structures which we

believe to be darkened spherulites (Fig. 14).

4. Discussion
There is a distinct expansion morphology displayed in examples
(a) to (e) on Fig. 14. The densely packed radial structure visible in
the normal-size spherulites on Figs. 12 and 13 is replaced by a
layout in which seemingly individual radial crystals (or aligned
groups of crystals) can be seen as independent bodies with tiny

spaces between them. At the same time, the overall sphere has
been fractured by the expansion process (see especially 14(a), but
also to a lesser extent (b), (c) and (d)) and whole segments of it are
dislocated from their original position while still retaining
approximately the original radial layout. This dislocation may
explain the lobes and other distortions visible in a small percentage
of darkened spherulites (see Fig. 3 and associated discussion).
4.1. What is causing the expansion?
Calcite heated to the types of temperatures quoted in this paper
has a moderate coefﬁcient of thermal expansion along the c axis of
around 25  106/ C (Chessin et al., 1965; Rao et al., 1968). This
would lead to about 1.0e1.5% length increase for each crystal,
which would certainly have an impact on the dense spherulitic
structure and would likely be irreversible on cooling if crystals
were forced to move relative to each other. However, it could only
account for a small proportion of the effect seen in our experiments.
The expansion from ‘unheated’ to ‘heated & not darkened’ on
Fig. 9 appears to leave the spherulites unchanged in all respects
except size. It could thus be interpreted as the ﬁrst stage in a
gradual progression towards the even greater expansion inherent
in the darkening phase. However, assuming no destruction occurs
after darkening, this progression would imply the production of
more and more darkened spherulites as heating continues, and we
did not ﬁnd this to be the case. More likely, therefore, is that some
spherulites expand but never darken, whilst others proceed on to
darkening; both groups stopping at their respective end points,
regardless of further heating. It may be that the smaller spherulites

are the ones that expand a little but stay undarkened and the larger
ones expand more dramatically, undergoing both distortion and
darkening. However, this cannot be deduced from the curves alone
and proving it would require additional experimentation.
The greater expansion, associated with darkening (see very
large spherulites on Fig. 14) entails the apparent development of
individual crystal units. This could result from the burning out of an
organic matrix. In addition, heating could result in pitting and
fracturing due to water-loss in a similar way to the changes found in
biogenic carbonates by Gaffey et al. (1991). Such processes might
also lead to some displacement if the combustion gases were
trapped, causing the intercrystalline spaces to expand.
Crystal re-arrangement could also be occurring as a result of
early stages in the calcination process. We can see from Fig. 4 that
spherulites burnt at 600  C would be turning into CaO if the gases
were freely exchanging with the atmosphere. They must, therefore,
be close to this point in the tube-burnt examples and would be
starting to undergo the complex changes that govern its dynamics.
The dissociation temperature of CaCO3 is strongly related to the
concentration of CO2 (Boynton, 1980, Fig 6.2) and a number of authors have recorded the expansion and decrepitation of either
calcite crystals or limestone under various conditions in laboratory
studies or real-life lime manufacture (Boynton, 1980, 163e164; see
also Stanmore and Gilot, 2005).
The larger scale fracturing of the overall sphere can be seen as
resulting from major stresses set up by the processes discussed
above and leading to a variety of crack morphologies. However, the
destructive sample preparation methodology unfortunately limits
the deductions possible from these photographs.

4.2. What is causing the darkening?
Following J.E. Brochier’s (1996) suggestion, and the success of
our tube burning methodology, we assumed that the darkening of
the spherulites was due to charring of organic matter in the matrix
of the spherulite. It follows that, if enlarged darkened spherulites
were re-heated for long enough in fully oxidising conditions, it
should be possible to burn away all the darkened organic matter
and leave an enlarged clear spherulite. This would need to be carried out at a temperature high enough to induce complete oxidation of the organic matter, but low enough not to cause the
transformation to CaO and breakdown of the spherulite structure. A
range of temperatures and heating times are recommended in the
literature for the measurement of organic matter by loss-onignition (e.g. 375  C for 16 h (Ball, 1964); 430  C for 24 h (Davies,

1974); 500 for 16 h (Rowell, 1994)). Since loss-on-ignition consists essentially of the removal of organic matter, it was relatively
simple to use the fence diagram in Fig. 4 to choose a suitable
temperature. Erring on the side of caution, we chose to oxidise at
500  C. Our aim was to completely destroy the organic matter, and
at 500  C there was no risk of transformation to CaO, even with very
long burns.
A small quantity of the material previously tube-heated at
600  C for 7 h (24.7% darkened; see Table 1) was spread thinly on a
slide and heated to 500  C for various durations. After cooling, the
powder was gently wetted with a refractive liquid to see if enlarged
but clear spherulites were present. None could be found, and even
with further exhaustive heating carried out up to 15 days duration
there were still large numbers of darkened spherulites present
(Fig. 15).

shown more clearly in e) and f).

Although this result shows some reduction in the numbers of
darkened spherulites after long periods of heating, it prompted us
to question whether organic matter might not be the only cause of
darkening. It is hard to believe that such organic material could be
so deeply embedded between calcite crystals that it failed to oxidise even after 15 days of heating.
An alternative might be that spherulite darkening partly results
from compound relief (Canti, 2003) produced by the microscale
crystal separation which can clearly be seen on the enlarged examples in Fig. 14. The expansion process has led to the creation of
numerous tiny crystal edges, each of which would have a bold
outline (relief) in transmitted light. Stacked up to a thickness of
10e20 mm, the overall effect would be to strongly opacify the
spherulite, whilst retaining the fundamental crystal layout which

can still be seen under XPL if the light source intensity is maximised. Fig. 16 attempts to simulate this effect by taking the front
face of the spherulite fragment in Fig. 14c and drawing outlines
round the crystal edges to represent the pattern of relief. Successive
smaller and smaller versions of this pattern are then overlaid to
represent similar faces as they would occur back through the
thickness of the spherulite. Opacity develops in just a few iterations, depending on the thickness and darkness of the relief, and
the degree of offset inherent in each overlay positioning.

5. Summary and conclusion
Our experimentation has produced a number of clear results.

darkened spherulites. e) Shows expanded structure on a medium sized spherulite. f) Probable covered expanded spherulite.

1) Darkened spherulites are produced by heating of fresh dung. If
whole pellets or other dung aggregates are burnt, patchy concentrations or complete destruction can occur in the same
experiment due to unpredictable burn characteristics.
2) Darkening occurs where the combustion gases are constrained
and temperatures are within a range between 500 and 700  C,
with a maximum production at around 600  C. Darkened
spherulites may well commonly exist for a short time, but they
will only be preserved if the ﬁre is extinguished before they get
too hot.
3) Only very small numbers of spherulites are darkened if the
combustion gases are free to exchange with the air.
4) Repeatable production in the laboratory can be achieved by
heating in a blocked tube, i.e. constraining the gaseous products.

This suggests that reduction may be part of what is causing the
darkening and that the same effect is simply localised in some
parts of the whole pellet burns (see point 1). The maximum
number darkened in the blocked tube was around 26% from
burning at 600  C for 6 h. Longer heating periods did not increase the darkened spherulite percentage.
5) Most spherulites undergo expansion on heating at 600  C. Some
expand a smaller amount without changing their optical characteristics, whilst others expand more, also darkening and
frequently becoming distorted, with the development of distinct
lobes.
6) Individual darkened spherulites cannot be identiﬁed in transmitted light then examined under SEM due to the continued
presence external coatings. However, after destructive

the counting methodology showed it to be accurate to ± 1.5%.

outlines successively reduced in size, representing similar crystal planes back through the thickness of the spherulite. If 10 iterations are overlaid, the result is nearly opaque (e).

preparation methods, the expanded remains of burnt spherulites can be seen. Their size and morphology suggest a process
involving organic matter burn out and/or crystal rearrangement which leaves the fundamental radial structure
intact. Dislocation of sphere segments appears to account for the
distortion features seen on some of the large darkened
spherulites.
7) The darkening itself is unlikely to be entirely due to organic
matter, as very long oxidative heating does not remove it. We
suggest that it is also the result of the compound relief produced
by multiple crystal edges inside the expanded spherulite.
Darkened spherulites are not going to be rendered transparent
over time by oxidation, and therefore enlarged clear ones will
not be found.
8) Darkened spherulites are likely to be very delicate due to the
expansion process. They will be easily destroyed by mechanical
processes and dark segments should then be visible.
Although many of the details are still to be understood, ﬁnding
darkened spherulites in archaeological stratigraphy can now be
conﬁdently interpreted as resulting from dung being heated in
conditions of limited gaseous exchange in, around or beneath a ﬁre
which is then not heated again beyond ca. 700  C. Such situations
would probably occur around any ﬁre where fresh dung is being
burned or where the existing stratigraphy has a dung component.
Since they are still calcite, preservation will be (as with normal
spherulites) pH and moisture dependent, the main occurrence
being in caves and rockshelters. Darkened spherulites could also
occur in household contexts, where the additional information
about burning conditions could assist in the deductions concerning
cooking and other domestic activities involving dung usage.

In all our experimental work, we generally found no more than
about 30% of the spherulites became darkened. However, archaeological samples with greater percentages have been found. More
than 50% of the spherulites appear to be darkened in part of the
bal rock shelter, Northern Spain
Chalcolithic sequence at San Cristo
(Polo-Díaz et al., 2016, Fig. 6b and c) and up to 70% in the central
phosphatised feature in Plate 2f of Polo-Díaz (2010), from nearby
Los Husos II.
The reason for this discrepancy is not known, but an interesting
possibility for further research would be to determine whether the
degree of reduction plays a part in the darkening process. We only
promoted reduction by partially blocking the gaseous exchange,
and a more complete experiment could, for example, burn the
spherulites in pure CO2 to see if it increased the numbers expanded
or the numbers darkened or both.
Also, the age of the fresh dung could be signiﬁcant. Moisture
content changes will occur in storage, which could affect the organic
component of the spherulites and play a part in determining how
many will undergo the darkening process when heated.
