Abstract
Investigations of geomorphology, geoarchaeology, pollen, palynofacies, and charcoal indicate the comparative scales and significance of
palaeoenvironmental changes throughout the Holocene at the junction between the hyper-arid hot Wadi ’Arabah desert and the front of the
Mediterranean-belt Mountains of Edom in southern Jordan through a series of climatic changes and episodes of intense mining and smelting
of copper ores. Early Holocene alluviation followed the impact of Neolithic grazers but climate drove fluvial geomorphic change in the Late
Holocene, with a major arid episode corresponding chronologically with the ‘Little Ice Age’ causing widespread alluviation. The harvesting
of wood for charcoal may have been sufficiently intense and widespread to affect the capacity of intensively harvested tree species to respond
to a period of greater precipitation deduced for the RomaneByzantine period e a property that affects both taphonomic and biogeographical
bases for the interpretation of palynological evidence from arid-lands with substantial industrial histories. Studies of palynofacies have provided
a record of human and climatic causes of soil erosion, and the changing intensity of the use of fire over time. The patterns of vegetational,
climatic change and geomorphic changes are set out for this area for the last 8000 years.

1. Introduction
This paper is a first integrated synthesis of the relationships
between human activity, climatic and vegetational changes
over the last 9000 years in the Wadi Faynan e Dana National
Reserve in southern Jordan (Fig. 1), a rugged, remote, arduous
desert-marginal environment. Particular attention is given to
a series of interrelated palaeoecological and geoarchaeological
ideas which inform an environmental history that relates to
some of the most profound, sustained and intense episodes

2. Location and previous work
Situated between the Mountains of Edom and the Wadi ’Arabah in Jordan, the gorges of the Wadis Dana, Ghuwayr (also
known as Ghuweir, Ghuweyr) and Ushakir (also known as Ashegar, Ashegair, Shayqar, Shegar) have their confluence near the
Khirbet Faynan, a major tell-like archaeological site, where
they combine to form the broad and open topography of the
Wadi Faynan that then enters the Wadi ’Arabah. The Mountains
of Edom are up to 1300 m high, with a fault-controlled and
highly-dissected rugged mountain front. They have a comparatively cool and moist climate for the region (Fig. 2) and are characterised by belts of Indo-Turanian steppe and Mediterranean
woodland. The rift valley of the Wadi ’Arabah at this point
lies below or close to sea level and is characterised by a hot
hyper-arid climate and sparse Saharo-Sudanian desertic vegetation. The ’Arabah at this point drains west and then eventually
northward to the Dead Sea (Figs. 1e3) (Adams and Genz,
1995; Al-Eisawi, 1985; Aresvik, 1976; Baierle, 1993; Baierle
et al., 1989; Barjous, 1992; Cohen and Stanhill, 1996; Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, 1984; Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,
1988; Ionides and Blake, 1939; Khammash, 2002; Klinger
et al., 2000a,b; Kurschner, 1986; Nikliewski and van Zeist,
1970; Powell, 1989; Rabb’a, 1994; RSCN Jordan; Zohary,
1962, 1973). This landscape is part of the spectacular and archaeologically-rich Dana National Reserve that is maintained
by the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
2.1. Mining and smelting of copper ores
The Khirbet Faynan appears to be the ancient Phaino
(Feinan, Fenan, Phinon e see Kennedy and Bewley (2004),
Knauf (1987, 1992), Knauf et al. (1987), and Schick (1995)).
A long-term research programme by the BochumJordanian Archaeometallurgical Research Group (Hauptmann,
1989, 1997, 1990, 1992, 2000; Hauptmann and Weisgerber,
1987, 1992; Hauptmann et al., 1992; Najjar et al., 1990, 1995;
Nikliewski and van Zeist, 1970) detected a w9000 year history
of the exploitation of copper ores at and around the Khirbet
Faynan. A programme of research by the University of California, San Diego and the Jordanian Department of Antiquities addressed the social archaeology in a deep-time study of the role
of mining and metallurgy on the evolution of societies in the

southern Levant, with detailed archaeological surveys and
large-scale excavations (Higham et al., 2005; Levy, 2004,
2006; Levy et al., 2003, 2004a,b,c, 2002, 1999a,b, 2001a,b,
2005a,b; Levy and Higham, 2005a,b; Levy and Najjar,
2005a,b; Muniz, 2006; Weisgerber, 2006). After relatively
small-scale and local gathering of copper and copper ores in
the Neolithic, and ‘‘household pyrotechnology’’ in the Early
Bronze Age, copper production became intense in the Wadi
Faynan area and down-Wadi in the vicinity of Wadi Fidan
(Adams, 2002; Lewin et al., 1977, 1995; Grattan et al., 2007).
Copper production reached major industrial scale through the
Iron Age, Roman Period and into the Byzantine, after which
it largely ceased with the exception of a minor episode in late
Mediaeval/early modern time (Grattan et al., 2007; Hauptmann,
2000). Overall, this activity left about 250,000 tons of ancient
copper slag (Fig. 1) and about 250 ancient mines and adits
within the 12 km2 of the copper ore field around the Khirbet
Faynan. This legacy also includes a complex pattern of archaeological remains (Barjous, 1992; Barker et al., 1998, 1999,
2000) and a locally metal-polluted environment (French
National Public Institute, 1974; Graf, 1988; Grattan et al.,
2003a,b, 2002, 2007; Overstreet et al., 1982; Pyatt et al.,
2002, 1999, 2000, 2005; Pyatt and Grattan, 2001). Additionally,
post-Neolithic human activity created some small-scale wallbuilt catchments (Hunt and Gilbertson, 1998), a huge field system, a barrage and a major reservoir (Fig. 1) that have trapped
sediments which provide records of the different phases of
human activities and of associated environmental changes.
2.2. Wood, charcoal and habitats
Studies of the wood and charcoal recovered from the a range
of ancient smelting sites, mines and adits, provide information
on past vegetation and human activities (Baierle et al., 1989;
Engel, 1992, 1993; Frey et al., 1991; Haynes et al., 1979;
Levy and Higham, 2005a,b; Mohammed, 1999). The data
(Table 1) inevitably have a patchy distribution in both space
and time. The great bulk of the charcoal studied is from the
Bronze Age to approximately the end of the Byzantine Period
and was argued (Baierle et al., 1989; Engel, 1992, 1993; Frey
et al., 1991) to reflect a climate essentially akin to that of the
present day approximately from the Late Neolithic onward.
Large timbers from trees such as oak were used for structural
support in Bronze Age copper mines and adits. Otherwise
wood-gathering for industrial use was thought (Baierle et al.,
1989; Engel, 1992, 1993; Frey et al., 1991) to have essentially
reflected that which could be gathered within the daily-walking
distance from the smelting sites in these desert-margin habitats.
This wood was dominated by shrubby desert taxa such as Tamarix and Haloxylon, some tree-wood of Wadi-floors such as Acacia, and oasis-taxa such as Phoenix dactylifera. Comparison
with modern process-based research indicates that such sustained activity must have had the most profound consequences;
both directly, through the impact of wood harvesting and mining
upon the geomorphology and ecology of the land surface, and
indirectly, through the need to sustain the extractive and smelting industries with food, water, shelter and other material needs

(Grattan et al., 2007). These environmental consequences must,
in themselves, have had important consequences for the human
inhabitants of this landscape; outcomes that may have been exacerbated by feedbacks and synergies within and between human and natural systems (Bruins, 1994; Constantinou, 1992;
FAO, 1962, 1995; Gilbertson and Hunt, 1996; Gilbertson
et al., 1985, 1996; Graf, 1988; Grattan et al., 2007; Levy et al.,
2004a; Zohary, 1962).
2.3. Palynofacies analyses
Conventional archaeo-palynology examines the relationships between peoples in the landscape e typically in terms
of human impact and farming practice e by determining the
composition and ‘‘meaning’’ of the pollen flora. This approach

is limited in some arid-zone research by poor preservation of
pollen, and by taphonomic pathways unfamiliar to pollen analysts trained in temperate latitudes (Horowitz, 1992). Palynofacies analysis deals with all the acid-insoluble particulate
organic matters in a sample, much of which are more durable
than pollen and thus available to the analyst, even in highly oxidising and biologically-active environments such as those often found in the arid-zone (Hunt and Coles, 1988). In this study
attention has been paid to the evaluation of palynofacies-based
approaches. People carrying out their daily activities in the
landscape generate or liberate large quantities of sedimentary
particulate organic matter which has been defined in the archaeological, palaeoecological and sedimentary records as
palynofacies (Combaz, 1964; Hunt and Coles, 1988; Traverse,
1988; Tyson, 1995). Among the most important activities likely

1993 and Mohammed, 1999).

to manifest itself in the sedimentary record of arid-lands is the
use of fire, which generates thermally mature material (recently
reported as microcharcoal by some pollen analysts). The present study assesses the extent to which the proportion of such
thermally mature material in samples relates to the intensity
of human activity implied by the other lines of evidence. In
the present study, this approach potentially provides an indicator of the intensity of smelting and thus metal pollution. Thermally mature material is, however, extremely durable and like
other charred remains is prone to recycling. As a result, this
study also examines the extent to which these materials appear
to have been recycled over time.
Fungal remains are another significant category of palynofacies not commonly recorded in studies of human palaeoecology. Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (VAM), for example,
are present in many soil profiles as a result of their symbiotic
relationship with the roots of herbaceous and some woody
plants. Fungal Zoospores and Concentricystes circulus (Rossignol) are also typically common in soils. These bodies have
been reported from soil profiles in the Survey Area, where
they are especially common in steppe and degraded steppe
habitats (Mohammed, 1999). They are not naturally present
in waterlaid sediments (Mohammed, 1999) unless recycled
into the water body from eroding soils. On this basis, the presence of significant numbers of VAM, Fungal Zoospores and
Concentricystes circulus in some sediment bodies in the survey area is likely to point to rapid surface erosion of soil
profiles e a further hypothesis tested in this study.
2.4. Environmental change and human impacts during
Holocene
The published record indicates that this study area is also
likely to have been affected significantly by major global

environmental and climatic changes (Baruch, 1986; Baruch
and Bottema, 1991; Bottema, 1997; Bottema and Barkoudah,
1979; Bottema and van Zeist, 1981; Bruins, 1994; EmeryBarbier, 1995; Fontes and Gasse, 1991; Frumkin et al.,
1991; Heim et al., 1997; Horowitz, 1974; Hunt et al., 2004; Issar, 1998; Kutiel et al., 1996; Kutzbach and Street-Perrot,
1985; Lamb et al., 1995; McLaren et al., 2004; Roberts
et al., 1993, 2004; Street-Perrot et al., 1991; van Zeist and Bottema, 1991; Weiss, 1997). Climate change is thus likely to
have driven geomorphological process during the Quaternary
at this sensitive location, resulting in a patchy record of episodic incision, rock-cut surfaces and channels, complex fluvial
deposits, alluvial fans and colluvial sequences, aeolian deposits, and soil development (Hunt et al., 2004; McLaren
et al., 2004; Mohammed, 1999). These features were variously
attributed to a changing regional base-level, climatic fluctuations, local tectonic factors (McLaren et al., 2004), with human impacts upon vegetation and runoff becoming important
during the Holocene (Hunt et al., 2004). The ‘‘patchy’’ evidence of the character of the Early Holocene was determined
by the deposits defined as the upper part of the Faynan Member (Table 2) (Hunt et al., 2004; McLaren et al., 2004;
Mohamed and Hunt, 1998). The limited evidence detected
for the Early Holocene in the area, before w6500 uncal. BP,
indicated that fluvial activity at the base of the mountain front
consisted of perennial channelised flow in the Wadi-floors
within and beyond the gorges. At this time, palynological
and geomorphic evidences indicated a more humid climate
than prevails today, with a steppe-like vegetation. Close to surface water, there were tree taxa, such as oak, reaching as far
into the desert lowlands at site 5021, near the Late Neolithic
Tell Wadi Faynan (Fig. 1; Grattan et al., 2007; Hunt et al.,
2004; Najjar et al., 1990). Macrofossils of Quercus, Olea
and Cupressus were recovered from fluvial deposits in the

floor of the gorge of the Wadi Ghuwayr at site 5510; whilst
aquatic molluscs and diatoms were respectively recovered
from fluvial deposits in the gorge of the Wadi Dana at 5015
and 5500 and in the open topography down-Wadi in the
Wadi Faynan at 5021 (Fig. 1). There were also suggestions
of human impact upon the vegetation through cultivation
and grazing both suppressing tree and shrub growth and promoting local soil erosion (Hunt et al., 2004). In this list of inferred events and processes, the most notable event mentioned
in previous research is a substantial aridification in climate
that took place from around 6500 radiocarbon years BP. Although further climatic fluctuations after this event have
been envisioned by many, but not all researchers (see Bruins,
1994; Dalfes et al., 1997a; Engel, 1992, 1993; Frumkin et al.,
1994, 1998, 1991; Issar, 1998; Raikes, 1984), this sustained
aridification was thought to have essentially established
locally the general character of the modern climate and vegetation. Subsequently, smaller climatically-driven vegetation
changes are also evident, as are the consequences of the massive mining and smelting of copper that occurred from Bronze
Age to Byzantine times. Despite the patchy and discontinuous
nature of the evidence in the area for the Early Holocene, the
inferred sequence of climatic change does bear comparison
with the longer-term, more continuous records produced
nearby (Bar-Matthews and Ayalon, 1998; Frumkin et al.,
1994, 1998, 1991; Issar, 1998), although the situation in the
Wadi Faynan from the mid-Holocene to the present day is
much less clear. Ground-water fed springs in the gorges,
such as the Oasis of Hamman Adethni in the upper reaches
of the Wadi Ghuwayr, however, were probably relatively
well-buffered against such short term events as well as the inferred mid-Holocene regional desiccation. As a result, springs
have probably supported aquatic and riparian habitats, sometimes with numerous palm trees, throughout much of the Holocene, as they do today.
The timing and rate of geomorphic and biological responses to the inferred human- or climatically-driven changes
are likely to have been diachronic e to vary according to time
and place. This important but largely unknown property has
been previously inferred in the region (Vita-Finzi, 1969) for
geomorphic processes over the last 800 years, but it remains
largely unknown for longer periods of time. Similarly, although there are now detailed histories of substantial earthquake shock in the area to the west (e.g. Ellenblum et al.,
1998), little is known of the consequences of these important
events in this archaeologically-rich study area.
3. Methodology
This study has used formal lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic procedures to delineate and define sediment bodies
mapped during the Faynan Project. This is a consequence of
several properties of the study area e often encountered in
studies of arid-lands (Gilbertson et al., 1996). In this context,
of central importance are the following: a general regional
absence of previous geoarchaeological research; the evident
isolated and fragmentary nature of the sequences discovered

for the first time in this reconaissance study; the rationale for
correlation and dating; and the evident necessity of separating
description from interpretation.
Mapping was based primarily upon field survey, a process
that was aided principally by copies of original high-quality
black and white, vertical air photographs taken by the Royal
Air Force in the 1930s which pre-date any modern (pre1996) changes in the landscape. These photographs were provided by Professor D. L. Kennedy of the University of Western
Australia from The Archaeological Air Photograph Archive
for Jordan (catalogue references 41.018-20; 42.059-61;
42.114-6; 43.017-22). The character of the depositional environments was determined in the field from observation of sedimentary structures and the 3-D geometry of sediment bodies,
supported by laboratory determinations of textural properties

by sieving and pipetting, organic carbon by loss on ignition,
calcium carbonate by calcimetry and mineral magnetism by
Bartington Magnetic Susceptibility Meter (Mohammed,
1999).
All the new radiocarbon dates reported here are AMS dates;
and these together with all earlier dates are quoted in calendar
years to 2s using CALIB 5.0.1. Because of the inflexions in
the radiocarbon calibration curve over the last 2000 years,
those dates which formed a recognisable stratigraphic sequence in this period have been further examined using
OXCAL. The dates are summarised in Appendix 1.
Palynomorph extraction and counting followed the approach modified for arid-land and sandy sediments (Hunt,
1985). This approach recognises that the rate of sedimentation
in arid-lands is relatively rapid compared to that of many

temperate environments. As a result, the technique of mechanical disaggregation, swirling and sieving using pollen-free water avoids the necessity to process large samples with powerful
chemical agents to extract relatively small number of grains,
many of which are likely to have been sensitive to chemical
processes. The recognition and analysis of palynofacies types
follows (Hart, 1986; Hunt and Coles, 1988). Identification of
the past relationships between airfall pollen and the composition and structure of the vegetation in this topographically and
climatically-diverse region (Fig. 3) are informed by modern
vegetation, pollen-taphonomic studies carried out along the
distinctive elevational gradients in this area (Davis and Fall,
2001; Mohammed, 1999).
4. Geomorphology
The general distribution and nature of the main components
of the known Holocene sequence in the study area are summarised in Fig. 1. These were established by field reconnaissance and mapping. A formal description for the Late
Neolithic to present day, based primarily upon observable lithological properties for all of the deposits e ‘‘natural’’ and
‘‘anthropogenic’’ e known in the research area is set out in
Table 2. This table uses conventional stratigraphic terminology
typically used for older or ‘‘natural’’ sequences: in more detail
it follows upon and develops the procedures and definitions set
out in Hunt and Gilbertson (1998), Mohammed (1999) and
McLaren et al. (2004). It also sets out the associated evidence
from mapping, litho-, bio-, and chronostratigraphic studies.
5. Fluvial deposits
5.1. Faynan Member e upper part
The Early Holocene fluvial deposits from channelised flow
recognised as the Faynan Member (upper part) (Hunt et al.,
2004; McLaren et al., 2004) include the channelised fluvial sequence at site 5021 adjacent to the Late Neolithic site of Tell
Wadi Faynan (Figs. 1, 4, Table 3, Appendix 1; Grattan et al.,
2007; Hunt et al., 2004; Najjar et al., 1990). The upper part of
the Faynan Member also occurs in the Dana Gorge (Hunt
et al., 2004) where a Late Neolithic site (5015) is interbedded
with and overlies meandering alluvium (Figs. 1, 5, Table 4)
and in the Wadi Ghuwayr at site 5510 (Figs. 1, 6, Table 5).
An apparently diachronous transition from meandering to
braided alluvium is present in the Faynan Member, interpreted
(Hunt et al., 2004) as resulting from landscape disturbance by
early agriculturalists.
5.2. Khirbet Faynan Gravel Member
Thin and laterally discontinuous trough cross-bedded sandy
gravels attributed to flooding of the land surface by ephemeral
braided flows were found interbedded within copper smelting
slags and ash deposits of the Atlal Member near the Khirbet
Faynan (sites 5738 and 5739, Fig. 7) and dated to
2860  40; cal BP 2862e3140 (Beta-203411). They occur

only with these anthropogenic deposits. The gravels and the
interbedded Atlal Member deposits contain mollusc shells e
mostly Theba sp. but also a few Xeromunda sp., suggesting
a lightly-vegetated Wadi-margin environment.

5.3. Dana Wadi Member
Distinctive and widespread fluvial deposits suggesting intermittent braided flow and aeolian activity have, however,
been recognised over a wide area as the Dana Wadi Member
(Figs. 1, 8 and 9, Tables 6, 7, 8 and Appendix 1). They
form a complex landform, in total 1e3 m high, at the margins
of the modern braid-plains. The fluvial deposits are interbedded with colluvium and alluvial fans of the Hannam Member
at a number of sites including 5520, 5511 and 5716. The maximum age of Dana Wadi Member sedimentation is dated in the
Wadi Ghuwayr at site 5511 where colluvium radiocarbon
dated to 1220  40 BP; cal BP 1058e1265 (Beta-119620) underlies the fluvial unit. Charcoal in trough cross-bedded sandy
gravels at site 5710 in the Wadi Dana was dated to 670  40

BP; cal BP 670e550 (Beta-203403), a date of 390  50 BP;
cal BP 315e515 (Beta-115214) was obtained on wood in
slackwater sediments at site 5025 in the Wadi Faynan and at
5509 a date of 110  50 BP; cal. 320e0 (Beta-119600) on
charcoal. Deposition of the Dana Wadi Member had ceased
some time before deposition of the Hamman Member alluvial
fan at site 5520, where the second incision terrace contains
wood dated to 100  50 BP; cal BP 277e0 (Beta-119602).
Site 5025 is unique in the survey in that the deformed
sediment body recognised as unit 3 (Table 6, Appendix 1 and
Fig. 8) displays evidence of substantial post-depositional disturbance through loading and slumping. Similar disturbance
is not seen in other fluvial units in the survey area so can
only occur under very unusual conditions. These sediments
are open and porous and would de-water rapidly, and are hence
would not have been prone to more typical wet sediment loadcasting, for example by sudden deposition or mass movement.
Further, this is an open low-gradient location and not a context
where shock-loading from sudden mass movement from
adjacent hillslopes might be expected. Earthquake shock of
wet sediments is the most likely cause of the deformation
structures at this site. Historical-period earthquakes are reported in the region (Ellenblum et al., 1998; Ken-Tor et al.,
2001; Klinger et al., 2000a,b) in the light of available stratigraphic evidence for this site, the well-documented large
(Mw w 7) earthquake of AD1458 is a possible candidate.
Whilst we have not found settlement structures or other
substantive archaeological remains, the Dana Wadi Member
does contain evidence of the past transient presence of people
in the form of distinct lenses of ash within the fluvial deposits,
at 5509, 5511, 5520, and 5521. These sites provide evidence
that is readily overlooked in fieldwork and is easily lost at
the surface exposure.
5.4. Fluvial aggradation and incision
The fluvial record in the Wadi Faynan is thus marked by
two major aggradative episodes, of very different character.
They are anomalous in the study area e pene-contemporaneous erosion and deposition being commonplace in the modern
landscape and most probably characterising much of Holocene

the comparative lack of time for geomorphic processes to
erode it. Regional comparisons suggest that Late Holocene
alluviation is widespread although very poorly dated in most
cases (Dimbleby and Vita-Finzi, 1971; Goldberg, 1987;
Goldberg and Rosen, 1987; Rosen, 1989, 1995; Vita-Finzi,
1969, 1978) over an area extending from the Persian Gulf,
through Jordan, to Tunisia.

6. Aeolian deposits
Aeolian deposits of the Tell Loam Member were previously recognised and interpreted (McLaren et al., 2004).
They are frequently exposed west of the Khirbet Faynan
where they typically have been sorted by overland flow
and affected by episodes of soil development. Exposure
5022 is representative (Fig. 4). This sequence indicates discontinuous aeolian deposition, water-washing, and at relatively more stable times there was the formation of thin
palaeosols. The absence of any detailed chronology prevents
the precise local identification of an episode of extreme
aridity such as that identified elsewhere (Bottema, 1997;
Dalfes et al., 1997a,b; MacDonald et al., 2001; Whyte,
1995; Zohary, 1962) and attributed to the Early Bronze
Age, which has been discussed in terms of changes in settlement, palaeoeconomy or land use in the region. Shallow
aeolian silts/fine sand dunes have also accumulated up to
the present day behind ancient walls and upon Romane
Byzantine smelting slags over wide areas to the east of
5022. These aeolian deposits stand in great contrast to the
channelised fluvial deposits with epsilon cross-bedding and
overbank deposition that they are seen to overlie in the
Wadi-edge exposure at 5021.

7. Alluvial fans and slope deposits
time. Significant episodes of sustained fluvial erosion and incision are not always readily recognised in the field and are
not necessarily amenable to dating but these also seem to be
of short duration and unusual in Holocene time. The most evident consequence of fluvial downcutting follows the transition
from channelised fluvial flow to aeolian deposition at 5021e
5022 (Figs. 1, 4). This downcutting has resulted in the
Early-Mid Holocene fluvial deposits of 5021 cropping out
3e5 m above the modern braid-plain. The evidence provided
by sites 5015 (Fig. 5), 5021 and 5510 (Fig. 6, Appendix 1)
suggests that within the study area, the overall transition
from meandering to braided geomorphic regimes was diachronous (Fig. 10). It is quite possible that this transition period
was actually more complex than the field evidence so far detected. A widespread but less marked phase of incision has
also exposed a 1e3 m high face of the Late Holocene Dana
Wadi Member at the margins of the modern Wadi-floors and
has resulted in the removal of much of these deposits. Compared with most other Members of Holocene age recognised
in this study, the Dana Wadi Member has a wide and often
continuous distribution; a property that probably relates to

The slope deposits and alluvial fans of the Hamman
Member were defined (McLaren et al., 2004) and are readily
recognised by their surface morphology and topographic associations, poor sorting and downslope bedding. Outcrops
occur primarily where small side entrant Wadis enter the
main gorge sections of the Wadis Dana and Ghuwayr and
here alluvial fans and slope deposits sometimes relate to or
interdigitate with fluvial deposits; e.g. at sites 5509 and
5520 (Fig. 9, Tables 7, 8, Appendix 1). Overall they are
patchy in distribution, especially where they reach the
Wadi-floor. Their chronology appears to be confined to the
later Holocene. At site 5511 the lowest colluvium is dated
to 1220  40 BP; cal BP 1058e1265 (Beta-119620) underlying the Dana Wadi Member, interdigitating with it and overlying it. Similar relationships occur at site 5716, where the
Roman-period aqueduct is buried by the Hamman Member
colluvium, which again predates, interdigitates with and
overlies the fluvial sediments of the Dana Wadi Member.
At 5520, Hamman Member alluvial fans postdate the Dana
Wadi Member.

This site is typical of a number of low terrace fragments
and alluvial fan deposits in the gorge sections of the Wadis.
It consists of a thick gravel terrace of the Dana Wadi Member,
which is incised by a colluvialealluvial fan almost 4 m thick,
containing a number of incision terraces. The stratigraphy is
shown in Fig. 9 and Table 8, where the sedimentary bodies described are indicated by numbers. All units are separated from
the younger deposits by an angular unconformity caused by
incision.
The example at site 5520 (Fig. 9) indicates, the wider stratigraphic relationships and palaeoenvironmental significance of
the Hamman Member are not always clear in the field e a feature
that is a function of the instability of the colluvium upon steep
hillslopes, recurrent phases of accumulation and erosion, and
the frequent absence of dateable materials. Only in the deposits
of the second incision terrace did we find materials that could
be radiocarbon dated e to 110  50 BP; cal BP 277e0
(Beta-119600). The origins of their fluvial components are evident in the trough cross-bedding. Overall, these materials are
similar to those that occur on the modern Wadi braid-plain
and suggest occurrence of the winter flood and flash-flood,
and occasional wind-blow, as occurs today. Another notable
property of the Hamman Member is the comparative rarity of
tangible traces of lenses of ash in exposures e possibly evidence
of human activity generally avoiding unstable sites on or adjacent to the Wadi-floor. It is clear from the slackwater sediments
in the Dana Wadi Member terrace deposits at 5520 that standing
water occurred at this site, where the main Wadi-floor was
blocked by encroaching material from the side Wadi, albeit
probably ephemerally. At site 5716, slope deposits of the

The Atlal Member is complex. The slag components have

French National Public Institute, 1974; Grattan et al., 2003a;
Hauptmann, 2000). Typically they occur as large mounds or
spreads of slag or clinker at or below the land surface, in places reaching up to 5 m above the adjacent surface. At the margins of the modern braid-plain of the Wadi Dana (Fig. 1), slag
and ash from ore-processing and smelting are interbedded with
braided river deposits (Grattan et al., 2007). In the basal parts
of the infill deposits at 5512, adjacent to the barrage at Khirbet
Faynan, they comprise complex mineral-rich deposits associated with ore-processing and smelting that accumulated on
dryland before the construction of the Khirbet Barrage. These
are in turn overlain by the deposits of the Khirbet Member

described below. Below the Khirbet Barrage, a major spread of
interbedded slag and ash was sampled in sites 5738, 5739 and
5741, dated from the Bronze Age to the (post) Mediaeval
(Grattan et al., 2007) (Appendix 1). Theba and Xeromunda
are present in some of the ash layers, suggesting a very
sparsely-vegetated landscape. No molluscs are present in the

1319

slag layers, probably because of the high toxicity. Also present
at these sites are bones, mostly of sheep/goat, charred barley
grains, grape pips and date stones, Conus and cowrie shells,
fish vertebrae and insect pupa cases. Much of this debris reflects aspects of human consumption and exchange networks.

8.2. The Khirbet Member
The waterlain sequences of the Khirbet Member infill artificial basins and are exemplified in sites 5017, 5517, 5051 and
the upper part of 5512 (Figs. 1, 11e15; Appendix 1). Early deposits of this Member, e.g. 5051 and 5517 accumulated in
small stone-built cisterns on the surface of ancient alluvial
fans. Runoff was directed to the cisterns by walls of stonebuilt water-harvesting systems (Hunt and Gilbertson, 1998).
Site 5051 was provisionally attributed to the Chalcolithic
age on archaeological grounds (Hunt and Gilbertson, 1998),
but surveys made by the UCSD team throughout the Faynan
area have not found normative Chalcolithic (ca. 4500e3600
cal BC) sites (i.e. from the so-called Ghassul-Beersheva
facies) and a site previously attributed to the Chalcolithic
has been reassigned to the Early Bronze Age (Levy et al.,

2001a). The stratigraphy of 5051 is described in Table 9 and
the sedimentary properties are shown in Fig. 11.
Geochemical investigation showed that the deposits at 5051
do not contain elevated levels of heavy metals and thus are not
associated with airfall-pollution from copper smelting in the
area, which these catchment sediments thus appear to predate (Grattan et al., 2007). The sediments, and particularly
the presence of significant soil profile-derived VAMs, Fungal
Zoospores and Concentricystes (Fig. 12) provide evidence
for rapid colluvial and slope-wash processes on shallow slopes
at a time of modest human impact on the landscape, before the
development of large-scale industrial processes during the
Bronze Age. This is also shown by the presence of abundant
thermally mature (charred) matter and particularly the presence of charred Poaceae fragments comparable in every way
with leaf fragments of Hordeum sp. (Fig. 13).
Khirbet Member deposits accumulated behind a large and
well-constructed barrage across a small side Wadi entering
the Wadi Dana immediately east of the major archaeological
site of the Khirbet Faynan; where they rest unconformably
upon on ore-processing debris attributed to the Atlal Member.
The Khirbet Barrage, its topographic situation and the associated infill sediments are summarised in Figs. 11 and 12. At
present, during heavy rainstorms in winter, water collects temporarily to a depth of several centimetres behind the barrage
where it helps to sustain 10 trees of Acacia spp., 3e5 m tall.
The infill deposits at 5017 were sampled using an Eijkelkamp
corer with a 6 cm Edelman sampling head to 232 cm with particular care to avoid contamination; and then confirmed to the
SW in trench 5512 dug to w3 m depth. The Khirbet Member

has several sub-lithofacies. The field and dating evidence in
Table 10 suggests that there is every possibility that the fragments of pottery and the charcoal from 2.04 to 2.06 m in 5512,
and the two samples of radiocarbon-dated charcoal fragments
from borehole 5017 have been reworked; these results, however, do suggest a maximum age for deposits from which
they were recovered. There is abundant visible evidence in
the sequence and in the magnetic susceptibility data of the following: the impact of fire; the re-working of crushed and
sorted copper ores, the production and discard of slag produced by smelting. These are paralleled by geochemical evidence for extremely high heavy metal concentrations in the
sediments (Grattan et al., 2007). All these features indicate
the use of this site for ore-processing and smelting as long
ago as 3390  40 cal BP 3485e3816 (Beta-203402). The sediment-deformation structures and small turbidite flows evident
in the sequence (unit 4) indicate the presence of permanent
water. Summary information on sedimentary structures, simple textural and mineral magnetic properties, together with
%LOI of the deposits and palynological information are set
out in Table 10 and Figs. 14 and 15.
From the evidence provided by (a) the depth and characteristics of this industrial pool sequence at 5512 and 5017, (b) the
minimal dimensions of the up-Wadi catchment (w20,000 m2);
and (c) the thick and porous Pleistocene clastic deposits that
are common in parts of this catchment (McLaren et al.,
2004) it seems reasonable to infer the following. First, the
transition from dry- to wetter Wadi-floor environments reflects
the effects of the construction of the barrage that then impeded
local runoff. Second, the climate during the deposition of units

2 and 3 in this area may have been notably wetter than occurs
today, as suggested previously (e.g. Bruins, 1994; Haynes
et al., 1989; Issar, 1998). At the end of the Byzantine Period,
there was a relatively sudden loss of nearby industrial activity
in the area (Fig. 14; Grattan et al., 2007). This is implied by
the macroscopic properties of the sequence in the upper part
of unit 3. Unit 4 indicates a notable rain-storm. Above unit
3 in the deposits of the Khirbet Member, there are no evident
macroscopic indications of pene-contemporaneous industrial
activity taking place nearby.
The properties of the unit 5 differ from those of the deposits
located below. The previous indications of industry and the use
of fire are absent. Sedimentary structures suggest a few major
events depositing copious silt in an ephemeral pool. The significant proportions of silt and clay (Fig. 15) are probably a reflection of aeolian materials, consistent with aridification. The
commencement of the modern sedimentary regime and climate, with its distinctive layers of fine sands and silts together
with leaves and other tree tissues, is evident in different properties of unit 6.
9. Geoarchaeology e site survival and representation
The geomorphological situation of the remaining exposure
of the Late Neolithic site of Tell Wadi Faynan, (sites 5021 and
5022; Fig. 4, Najjar et al., 1990) at the Wadi-edge cliff some
3e5 m above the modern braid-plain, has wider significance
for understanding the history of human settlement and activity
in the area. This settlement is the only such site to be identified
in the Wadi Faynan. The stratigraphy indicates the settlement
was at the edge of a stream channel, perhaps 5e20 m wide and
at least w3 m deep (Fig. 4; Hunt et al., 2004). Late Neolithic
people no doubt used the water and its resources and evidently
also discarded waste, charcoal, pottery fragments and metalpolluted ash onto the stream bank (Fig. 4; Grattan et al.,
2007). The presence of fully aquatic ecosystems with diatoms,
freshwater molluscs, reeds and similar marginal vegetation at
the time is clearly indicated e features that suggest that before
human interference there may have been trees in the associated riparian marginal habitat. A similar biologically-rich waterside situation in the Wadi Dana is suggested by the slightly
earlier Neolithic site 5015 (Fig. 5). Such riparian habitats
would have provided biological routeways and centres of biodiversity and human activity extending from the mountain
gorges into the desert. The area would have been attractive
at this time for a combination of reliable water and the proximity to the uplands offering substantial buffers from droughtdriven adversity. Such an environmental setting would have
been conducive to human settlement, which suggests that
many other settlements might have been located adjacent to
stream channels, with river long profiles graded to a level
3e4 m above the present effective base-level. Throughout
the Faynan Wadi system, such stream-bank settlements and
their associated deposits may have been lost by subsequent fluvial incision (Figs. 1 and 10). The topographic situations of the
remaining Early Holocene deposits and settlements suggest
that perennial fluvial channels must have existed not only

1322

within the gorges but also as distributaries upon the major alluvial fans fringing the mountain front (McLaren et al., 2004;
Rabb’a, 1994). Our mapping suggests that some Early Holocene sites might remain buried beneath the surface veneer of
deposits recognised here as the Tell Loam and Hamman Members. The survival of Early Holocene sites in open Wadi areas
is profoundly influenced by a combination of four factors: the
chances of exposure from beneath superjacent deposits, the
chances of surviving subsequent Wadi-floor incision and lateral erosion, the good fortune of discovery during field mapping in this difficult terrain; as well as the familiar problems
of site survival in a (at times) densely inhabited landscape.
The comparatively widespread and continuous distribution of
the much younger Dana Wadi Member emphasises these conclusions. The present evidence suggests there is not a simple
relationship between the original site density and the modern
distribution of Early Holocene sites.
The presence of the springs in the Wadis Dana and Ghuwayr today suggests oasis-habitats may have existed permanently through the Holocene, providing a continuous source
of good water, riparian habitats and associated plant and animal life. Little is known, however, of their long-term history.
The Late Holocene fluvial and alluvial fan sequences represented by the Hamman Beds (e.g. 5520 e Fig. 9 and the upper
part of site 5510 e Fig. 6) suggest that the lower parts of the
rock-floored gorges and their contained oases have, on a number of occasions, been engulfed, perhaps dammed, and then
emptied of fluvial and colluvial sediment bodies variously
1e10 m thick. Reworking and removal of the smaller materials must have been common.
Modern industrial mining and smelting may have major local impacts upon landscapes (Levy et al., 2004a). It seems
probable that the ancient intensive industrial activities, which

left w250,000 tons of copper smelting slag within this region,
must also have impacted locally through the pollution of soil,
air and water upon riparian and terrestrial vegetation cover,
and hence soil erosion, colluvial activity and fluvial geomorphology. However, the stratigraphic evidence summarised in
Fig. 9 suggests that the overall patterns of fluvial style, aggradation and incision in the Faynan area still remain, in significant part, explicable in terms of the inferred climatic
fluctuations and agricultural impacts (Hunt et al., 2004)
through a variety of mechanisms (Briggs et al., 1980; Bristow
and Best, 1993; Graf, 1988; Levy et al., 2002; Schumm, 1979).
One possible exception to the evident climatic control may be
provided by the fluvial aggradation that took place during the
Iron Age to Byzantine period, where thin fluvial deposits that
are interbedded and hence preserved with metalliferous slag at
site 5739. To date, no signs of meandering flows or finegrained overbank deposits of this age have been found. Locally wetter conditions at this time have been inferred from
the infill sequence at Khirbet Faynan (5017) and further to
the west (Issar, 1998) and north (Heim et al., 1997). The
lack of evidence for meandering flows from this period possibly reflects floodplain disruption by toxicity associated with
the metalliferous industry in the survey area. Obviously, other
evidence of ‘‘industrial impacts’’ may have been eroded or
buried. The new radiocarbon dates and pollen biostratigraphic
evidence both demonstrate that this transition from meandering to braided planforms took place over a period of 2000
years.
10. Palynology and vegetational history
The pollen biostratigraphy of the Early Holocene in the
study area was previously established (Hunt et al., 2004).

This section of the paper sets out a pollen biostratigraphy over
the last 5500 years (uncalibrated), w6200 years calibrated.
For ease of description, pollen types have been referred to
broadly defined habitat types. Following practice for the
Faynan region (Hunt and Gilbertson, 1998) these data have
also been attributed to the pollen assemblage biozones CLP,
CPE, C and CL, defined below and modified from Hunt et al.
(2004). Unpublished analysis of samples from the excavated
pit 5512 which was w3 m deep, show pollen and palynofacies
assemblages similar in all respects at equivalent horizons to
those from the 2.36 m deep borehole at 5017, but, surprisingly,
characterised by poorer pollen preservation. Short pollen sequences have also been obtained from sites 5051 in the
Wadi Faynan and 5520 in the Wadi Dana; and a single sample
from site 5509 in the Dana Wadi Member in the Wadi Ghuwayr (Fig. 1). Pollen diagrams from each site are shown in
Figs. 12e14, modified after Mohammed (1999). These individual analyses are incorporated into a full Holocene pollen
biostratigraphy sequence for the area that is summarised in
Table 11 and shown in Fig. 16.

10.1. PlantagoeCaryophyllaceaeePoaceaeeJuniperus
assemblage biozone (PCPJ)
The zone is defined at the Chalcolithic catchment-cistern infill (5051) described in Table 12 and Figs. 11e13. It is characterised by high percentages of Caryophyllaceae (15e25%) and
Asteraceae (6e22%). Also important are Poaceae (6e19%),
Lactuceae (1e6%), Artemisia (5e12%), Plantago (11e19%),
Ephedra (1e4%), Chenopodiaceae (2e8%) and Liliaceae
(1e4%). Other taxa occur occasionally, including Centaurea,
Geranium, Poterium, Succisa and Rumex. Tree pollen are
sparse, including Pinus (0e6%), Juniperus (1e3%) and Quercus (0.5e1%). Possible cultigens are present e Cereal-type Poaceae, Olea, Cannabis and Allium. Waterside species also occur
occasionally including Tamarix (1e4%), Pistacia (1e3%) and
Palmae (0e1%).
At site 5051, fungal zoospores are 1e8%, Concentricystes
circulus is 0e9% with substantial quantities (190e600%) of
Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (VAMs). These fungal symbionts on the roots of herbaceous and some woody plants suggest
significant soil erosion was taking place. Algae, including
Zygnema (0e10%), Peridinium (1e4%), Botryococcus (2e3%)
and Spirogyra (7e38%) suggest eutrophic, stagnant standing water. Palynofacies analyses (Fig. 13) show high percentages of
amorphous matter (62e93%) in the lower part of the core, falling
to 45e47%. This is most probably derived from the organic component of eroding soil profiles. Thermally mature material (microcharcoal) derived from burning of some sort is common
(21e30%) in the lower part of the site and decreasing upward.
Overall, the palynological results suggest a relatively diverse steppic landscape with substantial soil erosion and occasional standing water e a conclusion that agrees with the
sedimentary evidence. The rarity of tree pollen suggests that
perhaps tree growth was suppressed, possibly by grazing
pressure.

10.2. ChenopodiaceaeeLactuceaeePoaceae
assemblage biozone (CLP)
The pollen assemblage biozone is defined at site 5017 between depths of 2.36 and 1.90 m at the Khirbet Faynan barrage
(Table 10, Fig. 10) by high proportions of Chenopodiaceae
(4e47%), Lactuceae (16e45%), Asteraceae, (4e13%), Poaceae (4e9%) and Ephedra (1e17%); and moderate counts
of Plantago (1e4%), Caryophyllaceae (0e10%), Pinus (1e
7), Juniperus (1.5e8%) and Olea (1e2%). The top of the biozone is marked by increase of Pinus and decrease of Poaceae.
This biozone corresponds with local assemblage biozone
KH-1 (Mohammed, 1999). At the Khirbet Barrage, the substantial numbers of VAMs indicate significant erosion of superficial
materials in the surrounding area. The archaeological context
and geochemistry (Grattan et al., 2007) suggests this may be

the result of substantial contemporaneous local and regional
metal-producing activity (Hauptmann, 1990, 2000). Extrapolation from the adjacent site 5512 suggests the base of this biozone lies close to 1600e1800 cal. BP (Table 10). The age of
the top of the zone can be interpolated from 5512 to be approximately 1600e1700 calibrated years BP.
The presence of significant Poaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Plantago, and the members of the local desertic flora such as Chenopodiaceae and Ephedra, suggests that there was probably
a relatively degraded steppe environment in the area. At the
base of the biozone, the presence of Acacia (a low pollen producer), together with Tamarix, Nerium and Pistacia suggests
at least occasional trees or shrubs in waterside locations and
nearby steppe vegetation. Perhaps significantly, given the evidence for industrialisation, these taxa disappear at 1.8 m. There
are both pollen and algal indicators of water at this location, especially in the earlier part of the zone. Soil erosion is suggested
by the high counts for Lactuceae, Asteraceae and VAMs. This
reconstruction accords with the sedimentary evidence described (Table 10). Longer-distance inputs of pollen from the
different vegetation on the plateau or high mountain front are
suggested by occasional finds of Quercus, Pinus and Juniperus.

Quercus (0e4%) and Olea (0e1.5%). Trifolium (2e13%) is
found in this biozone in riverine sites, but not at the Khirbet
Barrage. The biozone was also identified at site 5025 is defined by a radiocarbon date of 390  50 BP: 315e515 cal.
BP (Beta-115214) (Table 6). The base of the biozone is estimated to be around w1600e1700 cal. BP by interpolation
from the dated site 5517. The biozone is equivalent to local
biozone KH-2 (Mohammed, 1999).
The high frequencies of Chenopodiaceae, Lactuceae and
Asteraceae, plus some Ephedra, Plantago, Caryophyllaceae,
Liliaceae, Glaux and Rumex suggest a degraded and relatively
dry steppe environment. However, a distinctive representation
of algal spores and pollen of waterside taxa (Tamarix, Nerium)
are associated with Wadi-floor locations. Continued presence
of VAMs indicates the erosion of surface and near surface
materials. Overall this evidence accords with the geomorphological inferences set out in Fig. 10. The presence of Pinus,
Juniperus, Quercus and Pistacia are therefore anomalous
and are likely to reflect plants growing on high on the mountain front or the plateau. Such exaggeration in areas of low local pollen production is associated with desert environments
(Horowitz, 1992). Taxa suggesting cultivation e Olea and
cereal-type Poaceae e occur and are consistent with other
archaeological evidences of farming (Barker et al., 1998,
1999, 2000, 1997).

Fig. 16. Pollen diagram from site 5520.

There are significant differences between the CPE biozone
and the earlier CLP biozone. Most significant in biozone CPE
is the decline of Poaceae and ‘‘true’’ steppe indicators such as
Poterium, both features suggest more arid conditions and
a more degraded environment in biozone CPE.

10.4. Chenopodiaceae assemblage biozone (C)
The site of this type is 5017 between 0.60 and 1.05 m. It is
characterised by significant Chenopodiaceae (57e87%) and
significant proportions of Lactuceae (6e21%). Other taxa
are Poaceae (0e6%), Caryophyllaceae (0e5%), Ephedra
(0e7%), Artemisia (0e2%) and Liliaceae (0e2%). The top
of the assemblage zone is defined by the decline of Chenopodiaceae. Cultigens become rare in this biozone. This biozone
is also recognised in the Dana Wadi Member at site 5520
(Fig. 16) in Wadi Dana and at site 5509 in the Wadi Ghuwayr
(Table 11).
There are no radiocarbon dates for the base of this biozone
but field relationships described previously suggest it is older
than the radiocarbon date of 390  50 BP; 315e515 cal. BP
(Beta-115214) obtained at site WF5025. Thus, assemblage biozone C may have started in the latest Medieval or early postMedieval. A radiocarbon date of 110  50 BP; 60 (95%) 290
cal. BP (Beta-119600) at WF5509 is associated with a pollen
assemblage assigned to this biozone. At WF5520, a radiocarbon date of 100  50 BP; 10 (92%) 250 cal. BP (Beta119602) is associated with an assemblage of the next biozone.
It seems probable that the top of this assemblage zone belongs
to the late 19th century A.D. The biozone was recognised as
local biozone KH-3 (Barker et al., 1998).
The high percentage of Chenopodiaceae together with the
relatively high Lactuceae, Ephedra and Caryophyllaceae,
point to a desertic environment (c.f. El-Moslimany, 1990)
characterised by sparse Chenopod scrub, crack-pine and
some ephemeral plants. The closest altitudinal comparison

(Davis and Fall, 2001) is with the very hot, dry full desert at
300 m in the Dead Sea basin. The relatively high proportions
of Pinus and other plateau-taxa indicate that the numbers of
grains transported from long-distance have been exaggerated
by the low production of local pollen. Waterside pollen is absent but algal indicators of the local presence of water are minimal but occur, pointing to occasional, brief and intense
rainstorms that resulted in ephemeral shallow pools accumulating behind the Khirbet Faynan barrage. These features suggest a significant decline in rainfall. The frequencies of VAMs
are consistent with initially high erosion rates as the vegetation
cover reduced, then were followed by relatively limited erosion, presumably as the desert pavement formed. These deductions accord with those determined from the sedimentary
evidence (Table 10). The radiocarbon dates, consideration of
the duration of sedimentation and the general character of
the local environment, all suggest that this biozone is the essentially arid equivalent of that period recognised as the ‘‘Little Ice Age’’ in the more temperate lands to the north-west.
The decline in thermally mature material and evidence for
metallurgical activity noted in the previous biozone continued
through this period, pointing to the progressive attenuation in
the depositional record of the inheritance of earlier fires and
smelting.

10.5. ChenopodiaceaeeLactuceae assemblage
biozone (CL)
The base of this assemblage biozone is defined at 5017 between 0 and 0.55 m. It is defined by high Chenopodiaceae (0e
40%), Lactuceae (1.5e47%), Caryophyllaceae (1e30%) and
moderate Poaceae (1e19%) Asteraceae (2e16%), Plantago
(0e19%), Artemisia (1e8%), Pinus (1e8%), Ostrya (0e7%)
and Pistacia (0e7%). Other taxa present include Juniperus

cereals (0e5%). Casuarina and Eucalyptus have been recorded at the top of the biozone at the Khirbet Faynan site. Assemblages of this biozone have also been recovered from the
Hamman Member in a recent alluvial fan deposit of site
WF5520 in Wadi Dana (Fig. 16). The biozone was recognised
locally as KH-4 (Mohammed, 1999).
A pollen assemblage assigned to this biozone was radiocarbon dated to 100  50 BP; 10 (92%) 250 cal. BP (Beta119602) at site WF5520. A pollen assemblage assigned to
the preceding biozone C was dated to 110  50 BP 60
(95%) 290 cal. BP (Beta-119600) at site WF5509. Biozone
CL extends to the present day.
The biozone is essentially modern and characterised by
a rise of taxa such as Poaceae, Artemisia, Plantago, Liliaceae,
Caryophyllaceae and a decline of Chenopodiaceae, when compared with the previous biozone. This combination is consistent
with a degraded steppe, but is less desertic in aspect than
biozone C. More tree taxa are present, with occasional grains
of Pinus, Cupressaceae, Olea, Quercus and Juniperus probably
derived from the vegetation on the plateau. Far-travelled taxa
may also be present e probably from Europe e such as Acer.
These inferred far-travelled grains may reflect changes in
atmospheric circulation, with more winds coming from the
NW during the flowering season. The appearance of exotic genera introduced from Australia is noteworthy. Eucalypts were
planted in the area at the old mining camp (the present RSCN
camp-hotel, Fig. 1) in the Wadi Dana in the 1930s, and further
south in the Faynan and on the plateau. Similarly, she-oaks e
Casuarina spp. e were established on the high slopes and plateau above the Wadi Dana for both ornament and shade. There
are limited and patchy indications of the local presence of water
from the presence of algae and waterside plants. These conclusions essentially match those derived from the sedimentary
studies (Table 10).

10.6. Palynology at site 5520
The pollen diagram of site 5520 is presented in Fig. 16. It indicates distinct assemblages readily attributable to assemblage
zones C and CL, but also important local features. Sediments of
the Dana Wadi Member at this site are attributed to the Biozone
C as the result of the dominance of Chenopodiaceae (61%) and
a moderate count of Ephedra (7.5%). The very sparse tree
pollen present includes Pinus (3%) and far-travelled taxa such
as Corylus (2%). Trilete spores are present rarely (1.5%).
Steppeland taxa include Poaceae (5.5%), Caryophyllaceae
(4%), Cyperaceae (1.5%), Liliaceae (1.5%), Asteraceae (1%)
and Lactuceae (5%). The assemblage points to a desertic landscape. Shallow standing water is indicated by the benthonic
alga Spirogyra (3%). Soil erosion is indicated by fungal zoospores (13%) and VAM (13.5%). Moderate amounts of
thermally mature material (7e9% of total particulate organic
matter), point to some human activity involving the use
of fire.
Sediments of the Hamman Member at site 5520 are attributed to the later Biozone CL on the basis of the lower

proportions of Chenopodiaceae (17e34%) and Ephedra (1e
1.5%) and relative increases in Poaceae (6e8%), Plantago
(5e8%) and Caryophyllaceae (6e19%). These changes appear
to reflect the development of a poor steppe flora, broadly similar to the vegetation in the area today (Khammash, 2002).
Cereal-type pollen (1%) is occasionally present but its significance is equivocal e it may be the result of occasional broadcast sowing of grain after a storm by bedouin groups.
Waterside taxa are rare: Trilete spores (1%) and Pteropsida
(1%). Leaves of Nerium oleander were recovered from the
Hamman Member at this site, but this species is a notoriously
low pollen producer. Despite the overall aridity and poverty
of the environment indicated by these assemblages, the
presence of waterside species indicates relatively regular rainfall sufficient to support vegetation in the gorges. Spirogyra
(2%) reflects shallow standing water. Continuing soil erosion
is indicated by the VAMs (6e7%) and Fungal zoospores
(0e2%). Very low proportions of thermally mature matter
in the Hamman Member, (0.5e2% of particulate organic matter) demonstrate the virtual absence of people using fire
locally.
The palynological studies here and in Hunt et al. (2004)
demonstrate that coherent pollen and palynofacies assemblages
can be recovered from mineral-rich arid-zone sediments of
both natural and anthropogenic facies. Characteristic assemblage-types can be recognised across topographically diverse
locations and hence demonstrate the viability of a pollen biostratigraphic approach at a local scale in this complex landscape. Well-known (Horowitz, 1992) arid-zone taphonomic
patterns are evident, but are not strong enough to obscure the
signature of changing regional vegetation. The palynology
and dating evidence at 5520, 5025 and 5509 demonstrate that
pollen assemblage biozones CL and C can be recognised
several kilometres beyond the immediate vicinity of the type
site e the Khirbet Faynan barrage at 5017 e and in a range
of sedimentary-geomorphic situations ranging from the open
alluvial plain to confined mountain gorges. Hence, they have
biostratigraphic significance; they are not biogeographical
facies of one another. The ancient pollen assemblages have
distinct parallels with modern samples from different elevational vegetation-zones in the region (Davis and Fall, 2001;
Mohammed, 1999) and since the regional vegetation pattern
is controlled mainly by rainfall patterns, the ancient assemblages can be ‘read’ in terms of changing rainfall patterns.
Similarly high Chenopodiaceae percentages were recovered
north of the Dead Sea from a ‘Medieval’ context (Dimbleby
and Vita-Finzi, 1971) so it is possible that the C biozone has
wider extent than the research area.

11. Pollen analysis and vegetational history over the
last w2000 years
Inferences regarding aspects of the vegetation and environment for the sites and biozones described above, can be tested
using independent lines of evidence e sedimentary lithofacies
and palynofacies.

C.O. Hunt et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 34 (2007) 1306e1338

11.1. Palynofacies as surrogates for human activity in
the landscape
Among the most important human activities to manifest
itself in this study is the use of fire, which generates thermally mature material. In the data presented in this study
(Figs. 13, 14), the proportions of thermally mature material
are broadly proportional in some way to the intensity of human activity suggested by all the other lines of evidence e
magnetic susceptibility and intensity of metal pollution
(Grattan et al., 2007). Palynofacies analysis of the Khirbet
Member at the Khirbet Barrage, for example, shows that during times of intense smelting and metal pollution (units 1e3)
there was abundant thermally mature material, whilst higher
lithological units in this sequence contained very little (Table
10, Fig. 14).
Thermally mature material is, however, extremely durable
and thus is prone to recycling e evidence of which is shown
by the pattern of its decline in its abundance through units
4e6. Similar patterns are evidenced in the quite different sedimentary environments of the Hamman Member, which lack
significant evidence of human activity and have minimal thermally mature material, whereas the limited but consistent evidence for transient human presence within the Dana Wadi
Member is matched by low but consistent numbers of thermally mature material.
In the barrage-infill sequence at Khirbet Faynan and cistern
fill site 5051 (Figs. 13, 14), evidence for rapid soil erosion provided by the accumulated sediment column is matched by the
abundance of fungal symbionts and zoospores e the times of
the greatest disturbance to soil profiles (unit 2) evidenced by
the palynofacies around the Khirbet Faynan match the independent evidence of impact summarised in Table 10. Likewise,
significant accelerated soil erosion caused by the inception of
significant aridity without industrial activity (unit 5) in the infill deposits at the Khirbet Barrage, and inferred from the Dana
Wadi Member at site 5520 demonstrate high numbers of these
microfossils. Thus, however caused, accelerated soil erosion is
evidenced through these microfossils. Hence, this palynofacies-enhanced pollen-analytical approach is able to identify
changes in the local and regional vegetation and to separate
the consequences of climatic change from the results of human
impacts in this desert-edge landscape.
Comparisons with other Holocene pollen-analytical and
palaeo-hydrological research indicate that distinct palaeovegetational and palaeoclimatic parallels occur at other sites
in the wider region (e.g. Baruch, 1986; Baruch and Bottema,
1991; Bottema, 1997; Bottema and Barkoudah, 1979; Bottema
and van Zeist, 1981; Dimbleby and Vita-Finzi, 1971; EmeryBarbier, 1995; Gilbertson et al., 1985; Haynes et al., 1989; Horowitz, 1974; Kelso and Rollefson, 1989; Klein, 1982, 1998; van
Zeist and Bottema, 1991; Vita-Finzi, 1978). Thus, Table 12 and
Figs. 17 and 18 set out in summary, graphical terms, a formal
pollen assemblage biostratigraphy and a first outline palaeoenvironmental interpretation for the study area for the Holocene.
These conclusions were informed by pollen-taphonomic considerations (Davis and Fall, 2001; Mohammed, 1999) in the

1329

light of the modern relationships between topography, vegetation and precipitation (Fig. 3).
The coincidence of substantial alluviation and palynological evidence for desertic environments in the C biozone suggests that in the Faynan the time-frame of the ‘Little Ice
Age’ was a period marked by substantial aridification. The
wide occurrence of alluviation between the Persian Gulf and
Tunisia broadly during this time-frame suggests that this effect
was much more widespread than just the research area, and
that this episode of profound climatic disturbance was marked
in the southern part of the Middle East by considerable aridity.
12. Habitat resilience and ecological responsiveness to
changing precipitation during profound industrial
impacts
Through the earlier Holocene, possibly up to the Early
Bronze Age, there is a degree of consistency between the implications of the palynological (Table 12; Fig. 18) and charcoal-based interpretation (Table 2) of past vegetation in the
area. The presence of trees, from pollen and macro-fossils,
is demonstrated (Hunt and Gilbertson, 1998) before the start
of extensive metallurgy. The charcoal also demonstrates that
timber was used at Neolithic sites (Table 2) e most probably
reflecting local wood-gathering on the lower slopes and on
Wadi braid-plains (cf. Fig. 3). By the Bronze Age, charcoal
from trees living on the plateau suggests the likelihood of
long-distance transport, most probably, because of the bulk
and weight reduction concerned, as charcoal. The disappearance of charcoal of plateau species by the Iron Age indicates
that accessible timber had been depleted over regional source
areas. This situation further deteriorated by the Romane
Byzantine, where it may be envisaged that large areas of semidesert had to be scoured to produce the wood for the charcoal
required. These events were also suggested by the palynological evidence.
Apparent discrepancies exist within the palaeoeoclogical
information, between the immediate implications of the lines
of evidence e sedimentological, charcoal and palynological.
These discrepancies arise for two periods e (i) the Romane
Byzantine; (ii) the late Mediaeval/early Modern period: both
may have human, ecological and palaeoclimatic significance.
The palynology suggests that a degraded steppe with surface erosion is evident in the CLP Biozone. Interestingly,
this occurred when the sedimentological and algal microfossil
evidence (Table 10, Figs. 14 and 18) indicates that the environment was wet enough to sustain perennial standing water behind the barrage for many years. Given the geography of the
site it is difficult to attribute other than a climatic reason e
greater precipitation e for this. As a result, this might have
been anticipated, for example, to promote increased woody
vegetation, visible in both the palynological evidence and in
the charcoal. It is clearly not reflected in the Iron Age to Byzantine charcoal (Table 2). Evidently, the Faynan landscape
should have been significantly less desertic than is implied
by the available biological evidence. The finding of greater,
climatically-driven wetness at this time is, however, matched

by palynological studies of the taphonomically-simpler depositional environment of the Dead Sea (Heim et al., 1997) indicate that real climatic events processes were involved.
The explanation for the apparent discrepancy between these
lines of evidence most probably lies in the scale and intensity of
the wood-gathering that sustained industrial activity in the area.
The scale of these activities is suggested by the volume of

charcoal necessary for the industry indicated by the archaeological evidence and huge quantities of smelting slags in the landscape. Charcoal and wood must also have been used for
associated domestic and agricultural purposes. Simple calculation provides one measure of the significance of the charcoal
production for timber species in the area. The weight of copper
slag from smelting during the Iron Age to the Byzantine in the

Fig. 3.

C.O. Hunt et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 34 (2007) 1306e1338

immediate area of the Khirbet Faynan was estimated as in the
order of 170,000 tons (Hauptmann, 1990, 2000). Focussing
upon only charcoal for smelting, estimates of the ratio of the
ore charge to charcoal needed for successful smelting varies between 1:1 (for very efficient technology and rich ores) and 1:3
where there was much slag. The translation from wood to charcoal may have been as low as 15% (Constantinou, 1992; FAO,
1962, 1995; Overstreet et al., 1982; Rothenberg et al., 1978).
Hence the tonnages of slag detected in the Faynan (Hauptmann,
2000) indicate the weight of wood used in the Faynan must have
been totalled many millions of tons, between the Bronze Age to
the Byzantine period. In practice, throughout the periods of intense metallurgical activity, the economics of transport suggests
that the import of charcoal into the Faynan must have substantially exceeded the transport of wood, but the source areas can
only be guessed.
The timber consumption has to be viewed in terms of the productivity of what the palynological evidence (above) indicates
was, at best, an open, treeless, biologically-unproductive region.
Overall these considerations suggest a colossal industrial demand for woody shrubs, Acacia, Tamarix, palms, and other timber and they also imply that there was a profound and extended
ecological impact that has been partially-obscured by the patchiness and sparsity of the regional palaeoecological record. The
vegetational openess implied by the pollen analysis and the
charocal data suggests wood harvesting had the most profound
impacts upon species composition, physiognomy and perhaps,
greatly reduced ability of tree species to respond to the improved growing conditions provided by sustained increased precipitation. The woodland habitats either were no longer present
anywhere nearby and/or had their resilience substantially depressed. It is not unreasonable to expect that timber might
have been deliberately managed for industrial (and perhaps
domestic) uses, but there is no evidence for this.
The second apparent discrepancy relates to the lack of any
indications of human impact on vegetation associated with
the brief phase of copper and lead smelting attributed to
the late Ayyubid/early Mamluk period of the 13th century
(Hauptmann, 1990, 2000; Grattan et al., 2007). The landscape
at that time is inferred to have been either a very degraded steppe
environment and/or a steppe-desert environment (Fig. 18). This
interpretation conforms with the sedimentary evidence from the
Khirbet Faynan, and perhaps, the characteristics of the Dana
Wadi Member, although these deposits may be slightly younger
in age. The charcoal recovered from smelting slags at this time,
however, was dominated by tree timber e suggesting wood was
now available on the high mountain front (Table 2, Fig. 3):
Quercus and Olea occur, with only one desertic taxon being recorded e Tamarix. Again, the deliberate procurement and
transport of this wood from upland areas to the arid desert
margins of the Faynan seems probable but unproven.
12.1. Geomorphological, vegetational and climatic
change and human activity in the Holocene
Field mapping has emphasised both the patchiness of the
surviving record and the substantial extent to which it can

1331

be augmented by studies of deposits directly or indirectly resulting from human activity. The use of formal terminology,
as employed here to describe both natural and anthropogenic
deposits and pollen assemblage zones, is shown to be a practicable and important aid for archaeological and palaeoenvironmental interpretations. Even so, the demonstrably patchy and
fragmented distribution of many sedimentary bodies indicates
that much key evidence is likely to have been missed. General
consideration of the magnitude and frequency of events in the
Faynan region suggests that the survey may have either missed
and/or emphasised some shorter-term or rare episodes and
changes (Raikes, 1984). Precise details of local climatic timing, strength, abruptness or longevity typically remain unknown because there is, at present, insufficient evidence to
assess whether the non-sequences reflect purely local geomorphic episodes of erosion, truncation or re-working, or reflect
abrupt, regional-scale, climatically-driven events. Further targeted dating studies are needed. Nevertheless, overall pattern
of change in the fluvial geomorphic systems appears to have
been diachronic (Fig. 10).
Human impacts e primarily through vegetation disturbance
by grazing animals e on fluvial processes drove a diachronic
transition from meandering to braided alluviation were identified in the Neolithic (Hunt et al., 2004). Similarly, agricultural
impacts on slope processes may be evident in this study, particularly at site 5051. The implications, however, of the new
palynological and compiled charcoal evidence are that these
impacts were small in comparison to the changes in the biology and landscape manipulation brought about, directly or indirectly, as a result of ore-processing and smelting between the
Bronze Age and Byzantine.
In contrast, the primary determinant of fluvial geomorphological activity in the later Holocene (Fig. 10) appears to have
been the nature of the prevailing climate, with a dryer ‘Little
Ice Age’ phase characterised by aggrading braided systems
and the slightly wetter phases by incision, most probably of
braided systems. The patchy nature of the evidence is emphasised by the relative importance in this area of the anthropogenic sediment sequences e small ponds, barrage-infill
deposits, and piles of smelting slag. For example, outside
the barrage-infill sequence, evidence of fluvial activity between deposition of the Faynan and Dana Wadi members
was only detected in thin intrusive fluvial deposits trapped in
accumulating piles of copper smelting slag. This geomorphic
analysis also suggests that the survival and visibility of
many Neolithic riparian and waterside sites outside the gorges
is a complex function of the locational chance in a complex
geomorphological history.
This study has demonstrated that in this arid-land, at appropriate depositional sites with rapid sedimentation of finegrained (and sometimes toxic) sediments, pollen, palynomorphs
and diatoms survive and can extracted in viable numbers using
low-impact (Hunt, 1985) preparation techniques. The patchy
survival of sedimentary records in the study area means that inferences from a particular deposit may not be representative of
all the time allocated to each pollen biozone in Table 12. In
particular, short fluctuations may have been missed; deposits

1332

C.O. Hunt et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 34 (2007) 1306e1338

of different climatic affinities may have been removed or reworked. For some periods, it remains the case that there is comparatively little palynological information.
The longer-term vegetation dynamics for the Faynan region
are shown graphically in Figs. 17 and 18. This pattern again emphasises the great importance of variations in precipitation in
determining the character and location of plant biotopes in
the region up to and including the middle Holocene, when the
character of the vegetation in the early Holocene was significantly different from that of today. In the broadest terms, modern biogeography became established as a result of a significant
climatically-driven aridification in the early Bronze Age. Climate was again significant after the Byzantine period, especially during the time equivalent to that of the European
‘‘Little Ice Age’’. The modern situation appears to be significantly different from that which prevailed a few centuries
ago, confirming the views of observations at this location by informed surveyors (Ionides and Blake, 1939).
This overall pattern of vegetational change in the early-middle
Holocene derived from this study corresponds surprisingly well
with wider geographical syntheses of Holocene climate change
(COHMAP Members, 1988; Kutiel et al., 1996; Roberts, 1998;
Roberts et al., 1993, 2004). The Faynan has similarities with
several other palaeoclimate sequences from the Southern Levant (Hunt, in press), the Gulf states and North Africa (Fontes
and Gasse, 1991; Hassan, 1981, 1997; Haynes et al., 1989;
Kutzbach and Street-Perrot, 1985; Lamb et al., 1995; Mawson
and Williams, 1984; Pachur and Braun, 1980; Pachur and
Kropelin, 1987; Street-Perrot et al., 1991), but it contrasts
with the palaeoclimate sequences in the Northern Levant. A
major climatic discontinuity appears to separate the Northern
Levant countries (Turkey and Iran) from the Southern Levant
countries (Jordan, Palestine, parts of Saudi Arabia (Haynes
et al., 1979; Hunt, in press) the Gulf States and NE Africa).
Interestingly, this parallelism consists not only of similarities
between the broad course of palaeoclimatic events, but also
consistencies and apparent inconsistencies between the various
lines of evidence, at times of intense human impact on the
landscape. The time-resolution of the various surveys limits
the extent to which important comparisons can be made between the various regions. For example, the new palaeoecological and/or geomorphic data from the Faynan are not
sufficiently resolved to support the key palaeoclimatic conclusion of Roberts et al. (2004). This focused upon short duration ‘‘see-saw’’ climatic effects which are evident in
instrumental and tree-ring records (that do not as yet exist
in the study area) e that wetter periods in the western Mediterranean (e.g. Barriendos, 1997) were associated with drier
periods in the east (Kutiel et al., 1996) ultimately attributed
to NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) fluctuations (Kreutz
et al., 1997; Rodrigo et al., 1995; Vallve and Martin-Vide,
1998). Nevertheless, when the various records are seen at
the temporal scales defined in hundreds or thousands of years
there is much coherence between the palaeoclimatic records
derived throughout the entire region. This parallelism exists
for the following palaeoclimatic phases identified in the
Wadi Faynan during the Holocene:

 the relatively moister 20th century;
 the notable significantly greater aridity (with occasional
catastrophic rainfall) dating from about 100 to 600 years
BP, quite probably distributed widely in the Middle East;
 the moist medieval optimum;
 the wetter RomaneByzantine period;
 Early Bronze Age aridification(s) which appears to be one
defining palaeoenvironmental ‘‘events’’ in the Faynan area
as elsewhere;
 a significantly wetter early Holocene with a landscape and
biota shown to be fundamentally different to that of the
second part of the Holocene.
Irrespective of discussions about its precise antiquity, it was
aridification broadly dated here to w6500 e5000 years ago
that marked the critical transition in the character of the landscape of Faynan area, from the wetter conditions of the early
Holocene to the subsequent landscape of greater climatic aridity with incised, braided Wadi-floors, arid steppes, grasslands
and desert. Again, there are no indications in the Faynan evidence that this aridification was the result, in part or whole, of
human activities. Following the aridification in the Faynan,
notable changes in human activity occurred: industrial scale
exploitation of the metal ores, and perhaps also wider changes
in agricultural practice and lifestyle.
Interestingly, the relationships between geomorphic, charcoal and other palaeoecological indicators of greater wetness
and those derived from palynological study are straight forward for the period before w5 ka. This loss of this simple relationship between pollen-recovered and inferred precipitation
in times of intensive and extensive past human impact such as
the Classical Period in the Faynan has also been noted widely
across the Mediterranean and South West Asia (Roberts et al.,
2004).
This new evidence indicates that the balance between the impacts of climate, people, vegetation, geomorphology and landscape has changed dramatically through time. From the
Bronze Age to the Byzantine period, human impacts stemming
from the increasing scale and intensity of ore mining, processing
and mining that has few equivalents in the Ancient World played
an ever more powerful part in influencing the character of the
landscape. Comparisons between the palynological evidence,
charcoal records and palaeoclimatic inferences suggest that
wood-gathering must have had a massive impact on the lowland
and mountain front vegetation in the area. Whilst it might appear
reasonable to expect that some form of integrated arid-land timber-management may have been practised, there is no evidence
to support this view. It appears likely that wetter conditions inferred from geomorphologial and palynological evidence in
the Roman period may have failed to have any detectable impact
of the local abundance of trees (in terms of charcoal and tree pollen) as a result of the scale of this wood harvesting.
13. Conclusions
This study has demonstrated that it is possible to obtain
detailed geomorphic, biogeographical and industrial histories

C.O. Hunt et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 34 (2007) 1306e1338

in this ecotonal position between moist mountain and lowland desert basin. The record is patchy and difficult, comprising sequences of natural and anthropogenic deposits and
landforms resulting from its long history of agricultural and
industrial activity. The sequences have been clarified by the
use of formally defined lithostratigraphy and pollen biostratigraphy. The Early Holocene in the Faynan catchment is
characterised by forest steppe, with riparian vegetation associated with meandering streams graded above modern baselevel extending out at least several kilometres from the
mountain front. Following a complex history of aridification
and agricultural impact which led to the degradation of the
forest steppe and loss of arboreal vegetation, the essential
character of the modern biogeographical and geomorphic
landscapes were established by profound aridification in the
Bronze Age.
After the Bronze Age, however, both lesser climatic fluctuations and especially human impact were also important in
shaping the vegetation. In particular, from the Bronze Age to
the Byzantine period, human impacts stemming from the increasing scale and intensity of ore mining, processing and
smelting played ever more powerful parts in influencing
the character of the landscape. Comparisons between the palynological evidence, charcoal records and palaeoclimatic inferences suggest that wood-gathering must have had
a massive impact on the lowland and mountain front vegetation in the area, and perhaps beyond to other source areas of
charcoal. The most detailed evidence is available from barrage deposits which started accumulating in the Roman period. In particular, it appears possible that wetter conditions
inferred from geomorphological and palynological evidences
in the Roman period may have failed to have any detectable
impact of the local abundance of trees (in terms of charcoal
and tree pollen) as a result of the scale of wood harvesting.
Subsequently, approximately synchronously with the cessation of major mining and smelting, the area became more

1333

arid, but with occasional rainstorms. Geomorphic and palynological indicators of profound local aridity are evident in
a period that appears to correspond to that of the European
Little Ice Age, after which fully modern conditions developed. Distinctive desert vegetation was abundant in this
arid phase, with the slightly moister climates of the last century being clearly represented. It is possible that this aridification was part of a regional phenomenon.
