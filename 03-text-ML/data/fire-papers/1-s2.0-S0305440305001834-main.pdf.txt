Abstract
The structures and compositions of modern and fossil charcoal samples were compared in order to evaluate charcoal degradation processes in
archaeological sites. Modern charcoal samples produced in campfires contain two major phases: graphite-like microcrystallites and a nonorganized phase. These phases create a mosaic-like structure with differing relative proportions depending on the taxonomic source of the
wood used. Fossil charcoal samples (Tel Dor, Israel: 3000 years BP and Kebara Cave, Israel: 40,000 years BP) also contained the graphitelike microcrystallites and the non-organized phases, but were clearly altered compared to modern charcoal. The graphite-like phase of the fossil
charcoal has much higher electrical resistivity, and its ESR properties show that it has markedly altered surface electronic states. Infrared spectra
show the presence of additional carboxylate groups. Oxidation has therefore altered the structure. This appears to be a ‘‘self-humification’’
process that affects the graphitic component, and probably the non-organized phase as well.

1. Introduction
Organic materials preserved in an archeological site can
provide invaluable information on the diet, bedding, housing
materials and fuels used by the occupants of the site. Organic
materials are also invaluable for radiocarbon dating. Most organic materials are, however, readily degraded by bacteria and
fungi, and are therefore not commonly preserved [10]. Only
charred organic materials tend to be preserved [18] and are
commonly found in many, but significantly not in all archeological sites. Charred materials are thus important components
of archaeological sites. We refer here to charcoal preserved in
archaeological sites as fossil charcoal.
Charcoal is one form of charred material. It is a product of
wood burning either in natural fires, where it can provide information on fire frequencies, that is in turn related to climate, or

on human activities [28]. Its presence in archeological sites in
association with hearths and other burned materials may be an
indication of the deliberate use of fire by humans [26]. Some of
the oldest charcoal thought to be produced by humans dates
back to one and a half million years ago [5]. In sites younger
than about 400,000 years it can generally be assumed that
fire was used and hence the absence of charcoal implies that
the manner in which the fire was used did not produce charcoal
and/or the charcoal was not preserved. In much younger sites,
charcoal may also be the product of various pyrotechnologies
such as metal, plaster, ceramic and glass production.
Most of our knowledge of the structure of charred materials
(termed char) is due to research on activated carbon for commercial use. These materials are generally produced in ovens
at temperatures above 1000  C, which is significantly higher
than the average temperature of a campfire (around 800e
900  C) [20]. In activated carbons the graphite-like layers
are referred to as the organized phase. The char also contains
a non-organized phase [13] composed of complex aromatice
aliphatic structures [4]. Rosalind Franklin [13] was one of

I. Cohen-Ofri et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 33 (2006) 428e439

the pioneers of this area of research. She used X-ray diffraction to propose a general structure for char (Fig. 1) composed
of two phases; a graphite-like phase and a non-organized
phase. We use her terminology [13].
In contrast to the study of carbon black produced in ovens
at high temperatures, surprisingly little is known about the
structure of modern charcoal produced in natural and man
made fires [28,7], and almost nothing about the diagenetic
processes that affect charcoal once it is buried in sediments.
Charcoal is a product of wood burning in an oxygen poor atmosphere. Significant chemical changes take place in the plant
material during the charring process [31]. As the temperature
increases the major structural components of the wood (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) break down while water, CO,
CO2 and other gases are released [31]. The evaporation of
these gases results in the condensation of the carbon skeleton
and aromatization, which leads to the formation of graphitelike layers [23]. It is known that organic compounds with
higher proportions of aromatic compounds typically have
higher char yields [6]. This implies that the graphite-like
layers will be formed in larger amounts.
Unlike the high temperature charred carbons that are produced in a controlled environment (temperature and pressure),
charcoal produced in open fires is very heterogeneous. The
charring process is not uniform, and even in a single fire a
variety of charcoal types from barely charred to completely
charred, are formed. The difference in tree type and hence
burning conditions, introduces an additional complication.
Charcoal characterization is thus a difficult task.
Little is known about charcoal preservation over time and
the causes of its degradation in archeological sites. Charcoal
is usually regarded as a relatively inert substance that is not
altered by chemical or biochemical processes [22]. A few
studies have shown that this may not be the case. Frink [14]
showed that the oxidizable carbon (which means the carbons
that undergo oxidation with K2Cr2O7 e most probably what
we refer to as the non-organized phase) present in charcoal
samples from an archeological site in New England is variable, and concluded that it had undergone diagenetic changes.
Bird et al. [3] demonstrated that the charcoal in Pleistocene
strata from an archeological site in Australia (Nauwalabila)

429

was altered. This alteration was viewed in the SEM where
the altered charcoals have a degraded internal structure compared to the preserved samples. Their carbon contents also
decreased.
One important complication when assessing charcoal degradation is the presence of humic substances. Fossil charcoal
is known to contain a certain amount of humic substances.
They are extracted during the preparation of charcoal for radiocarbon dating (the AcideAlkalieAcid (AAA) treatment
[24]). These structurally variable aromatic substances are
thought to be the degradation products of plants [8] and are
believed to penetrate into the charcoal from the surroundings.
The general opinion is that humic acids cannot be described in
well defined chemical terms. They contain some common molecular blocks [34] that include a nucleus of phenolic groups to
which are attached amino acids and aliphatic carbohydrate
groups. Widayati and Tan [34] used atomic force microscopy
(AFM) to identify hexagonal structured benzene rings with
side chains attached to these rings composed of carboxyl
and carbonyl groups. Yang and Wang [35] used Raman spectroscopy to show that humic substances from different sources
also contain graphite-like layers. Thus soil humic substances
may in fact closely resemble charcoal in terms of the presence
of graphite-like material and non-organized domains in both
materials.
The aim of this study is to improve our understanding of
modern charcoal structure, and then compare it to fossil charcoal in order to identify diagenetic processes that alter charcoal with time. The approach used is to first characterize
several modern charcoal samples, each produced in a campfire
using fresh wood and bark from a specific tree species. These
charcoal samples were characterized structurally using a repertoire of techniques that includes transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopy,
electron spin resonance (ESR), resistivity and TGA/DTA.
The same methods were then used to characterize fossil charcoal samples from two archaeological sites and by comparing
the modern and fossil charcoal structures, determine the nature
of some of the diagenetic degradation processes.

substrate. They were treated with 1 N HCl in order to remove
the remaining ash, washed twice with deionized water and
centrifuged at 3000 rpm and finally dried in an oven at
60  C. The samples were homogenized by gently crushing
and grinding in an agate mortar and pestle, and then sieved
to !250 mm. These samples were used as the standards for
the characterization of modern charcoal. See Schiegl et al.
[25] for details.
2.1.2. Fossil charcoal sample preparation
The samples are from the Iron Age strata of Tel Dor, Israel
(3000 BP) [32] and the Mousterian and early Upper Paleolithic
strata of Kebara Cave, Israel (50,000e40,000 BP) [2]. The latter are from the southern part of the cave. These represent two
extreme archaeological environments of preservation. Tel Dor
sediments almost always contain calcite, which is indicative of
an alkaline environment, whereas in Kebara Cave only the
sediments in the northern part of the cave contain calcite.
The sediments in the center and southern parts contain authigenic phosphate minerals that indicate that the paleo-pH was
once around 4e5 [24].
Each sample is a single piece of charcoal. The samples
were homogenized by gently crushing and grinding in an agate
mortar and pestle, and then sieved to less then 250 mm. The
samples were divided into two. One part was left as is and
the other was treated with 1 N HCl for half an hour in order
to dissolve associated minerals such as calcite. The treated
samples were cleaned with deionized water and dried. This
was repeated and the weight loss was noted.
2.2. Methods
2.2.1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
The charcoal samples were sonicated using a powerful
instrument (Heat Systems, Farmingdale, NY). The samples
were sonicated while floating in a cup horn to avoid heating
for 3 min in ethanol. After an additional 2 min to allow for
the heavy particles to settle, a drop of the supernatant was
placed on a holey carbon coated TEM grid. The particles
were examined using a Philips CM120 Super Twin (120 kV)
and Philips-FEI Tecnai F30 (300 keV-FEG) microscope.
2.2.2. Raman spectroscopy
Measurements were made in air at room temperature using
a Renishaw 2000 Raman Imaging Microscope through a 50!
lens without a polarizer. The excitation at 632 nm was produced by a 25 mw HeNe laser. Each measurement was made
18 times at random locations on a pellet of the powdered charcoal, and the maximum peak height and peak position were
determined and averaged.
2.2.3. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
FTIR was performed using a Midac Corporation (Costa
Mesa, CA, USA) instrument. The spectra were obtained by
mixing about 0.1 mg of sample with about 80 mg of KBr.
Spectra were collected at 4 cmÿ1 resolution.

2.2.4. X-ray diffractometry
X-ray powder diffraction patterns were collected using
a Rigaku Rotoflex-RU 200 B automatic diffractometer using
Cu Ka radiation. The sample was mounted on a germanium
crystal to minimize baseline rise.

2.2.5. Thermogravimetric and differential thermal
analysis (TGA & DTA)
Five milligrams of each charcoal sample was placed in
a platinum pan and heated to 1000  C together with an empty
reference pan. The heating was performed in an air atmosphere, with a heating rate of 20  C/min using a Shimadzu
DTG-50 instrument equipped with a microbalance. The baseline spectrum, obtained under the same conditions with two
empty platinum pans, was subtracted from the measurement
spectrum. The weight loss and the heating temperatures
were recorded

2.2.6. Electrical resistivity
The measurements were made using a Teflon cylindrical
cell with an outer diameter of 40 ! 20 mm and an inner diameter of 4 mm, and electric contacts made of copper. The electrical resistivity was measured using the two-lead technique
(in which the voltage drop is measured by the same probe
that produces the current excitation), and the measuring instrument was a digital multimeter. The charcoal powder was compressed using a miniature compression device (modified
Minimat (Rheometrics, USA)) and the electric resistivity
was measured as a function of the force applied to the sample
(F ) and the compression of the cell (l ). An example for one
charcoal sample is shown in Fig. 2. Since the resistance R
(U) is R Z rD/A, (when D is the length (m), A is the crosssection area (m2) and r is the electric resistivity (Uÿ1 mÿ1))
and l and R are measured, we calculate the electric resistivity
(r) from the slope of the curve where the resistance is linear
(between 115 and 150 mÿ1) (Fig. 3). This is the zone where
the charcoal particles interact with each other and not with air.

2.2.7. Electron spin resonance (ESR)
We used 20 mg of sample for a measurement. For the
vacuum experiments the sample was first placed in a vacuum
of around 2 ! 10ÿ2 torr, sealed and measured. ESR measurements were performed on a Bruker ER 200 D-SRC instrument.
The temperature was adjusted by a temperature unit control
(Eurotherm, B-VT 2000) with an accuracy of G1 K. A solid
sample of CuSO4 ! 5H2O of known weight and number of
spins/gr was used as a standard for estimation of concentration
of paramagnetic centers by double integration of ESR signals.
The accuracy of integration was 20%.

3. Results
We used a series of analytical techniques to characterize
modern and fossil charcoal structures. The transmission electron microscope provides direct images of the structure at
very high resolution. X-ray diffraction and electron spin resonance also provide information on charcoal structure. Raman
spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, electrical resistivity and
differential thermal analysis are more quantitative, but are
also more difficult to interpret structurally. Tables 3 and 4
show the results for the modern and fossil charcoal samples
using TGA/DTA, resistivity and ESR.

3.2. Raman spectroscopy
Fig. 5 shows a characteristic spectrum of charcoal with
a peak characteristic of graphite at 1575 cmÿ1 (the G peak)
and a peak at 1355 cmÿ1 which is known as the D peak (D
for disorder). The ratio between the two peaks has been
used to estimate the domain size of the graphitic areas [33].
Using this formula we determined that the average size of
the crystallites is around 4.5 nm (Table 2) for the 4 modern
charcoal samples. This is in agreement with the sizes seen
on the TEM images. The width and peak positions of the 4 different charcoal samples vary (Table 2) indicating differences
in their structures. The fossil charcoal Raman spectra
(Fig. 6) have high levels of fluorescence (before and after
HCl treatment), as indicated by the intensity values. The G
and D peaks are both usually present, but their shapes are
somehow influenced by the extent of fluorescence. See also
Alon et al. [1].
3.3. X-ray diffraction
Fig. 7 is a representative powder diffraction pattern of
a modern charcoal sample. It contains only one broad peak
centered around the strongest graphite reflection. This confirms that the graphite crystallites are very small. It was not
possible to estimate their average size from the diffraction
pattern using the Scherer formula because the signal to noise
ratio was too small.

3.1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
TEM images (Fig. 4A, B) show the basic structural motif of
modern charcoal samples produced in an open fire. The charcoal is clearly composed of microcrystallites revealed by their
lattice fringes that have spacings similar to graphite (lattice
spacing of 2.5 G 0.3 Å and also an interlayer spacing of
3.5 G 0.2 Å). These ordered domains are surrounded by
non-organized organic material. The graphite domains and
the non-organized domains are also present in the fossil charcoal sample (Fig. 4C, D).

the determination of the resistivity.

3.4. Thermogravimetric and differential thermal
analysis (TGA/DTA)
Fig. 8 is a representative TGA/DTA plot of a modern charcoal sample. The TGA plot shows that the total weight loss
during pyrolysis is above 95%. The DTA plot shows that the
major phase change (as reflected by the apex of the peak) occurs around 500  C. DTA analysis of pure geological graphite
(from Eckert Mineral Research) shows that it decomposes
around 800e900  C based on the location of the major peak
(not shown). We note that in the modern charcoal samples
there is no phase change in this temperature range. We assume
that the small size of the charcoal graphite-like crystals reduces the pyrolysis phase change temperature. The 4 modern
charcoal samples differ with respect to their DTA maximum
temperatures (Table 3). These differences presumably reflect
structural differences in the graphite-like crystals. The fossil
charcoal samples from Tel Dor undergo a phase change in
the same temperature range as the modern samples, and they
also vary from one sample to another (Table 4). This is true
for the fossil charcoal before and after HCl treatment although
the temperatures of the major phase change after HCl treatment are lower. They are similar to or lower than the lower
DTA temperatures of a modern charcoal sample (Olea). The
weight loss during pyrolysis of the fossil charcoal samples is
less than that of the modern samples, probably due to a higher
proportion of contaminating sediment before HCl treatment.

component burns at the higher temperatures. In modern charcoal this is around 20% of the total weight of the charcoal. In
the fossil charcoal samples it is up to 30%. This indicates an
increase in the amount of disordered organics in the fossil
charcoal, which is consistent with the DTA results.
3.5. Electrical resistivity
Electrical resistivity can be indicative of the relative
amounts of microcrystalline graphite-like components in the
charcoal, as graphite is a conductive material. Note that resistivity is the inverse of conductivity. The non-organized organic
component is probably less conductive or is a non-conductive
phase, whose presence reduces the conductivity. Thus the
more conductive the charcoal, the higher the amount of microcrystalline graphite. The range of the electrical resistivity
values obtained for the 4 modern charcoal samples is less
then 1r (Um), meaning that they are extremely conductive
(Table 3). Fossil charcoal, on the other hand, is an insulator
as its resistivity is so high that it hardly conducts (Table 4).
Surprisingly even after the removal of the calcite and other
carbonates by the HCl treatment, the resistivity did not
decrease, but sometimes even increased. This shows that

significant changes have occurred in the fossil charcoal structure compared to modern charcoal with respect to the conducting capability of the graphite component.
3.6. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
The FTIR spectra of the modern charcoal samples are all
very similar (Fig. 9). In general modern charcoal absorbs
weakly in the infrared range. There is one broad peak at
1578 cmÿ1 that is ascribed to the aromatic CaC ring stretching [23]. Comparing the spectra we obtained to those of Nishimiya et al. [23], we conclude that our samples formed in the
temperature range between 600 and 800  C. This is consistent
with the actual temperatures measured in open fires [20]. What
remains of the non-organized fraction is mostly aromatic
groups, which were probably dehydrated and deoxidized
[23]. The fossil charcoal spectra (Fig. 10) absorb much more
in the infrared range, and have well defined peaks that are ascribed to charged carboxylate groups (COOÿ at 1597 cmÿ1
and 1400 cmÿ1). After treatment with HCl (Fig. 11) the
1597 cmÿ1 peak divides into two peaks at 1618 cmÿ1 and
a COOH peak at 1710 cmÿ1.
3.7. Electron spin resonance (ESR)
ESR detects the presence of unpaired electrons (paramagnetic centers), that in charcoal are associated mainly with
organic molecules rather than transition metal ions. Unpaired
electrons associated with organic molecules are called free

radicals [21,27]. ESR can thus provide detailed information
on the atomic structure of such materials, which includes
graphite [30]. The presence of unpaired electrons in natural
charcoals is well-documented [17,7]. It is thought that free
radicals in charcoals are produced as a result of thermal damage of normal carbonehydrogen bonds during the formation
of condensed carbon rings [17]. During this process the unpaired electrons are stabilized by the cyclic carbon p-system.
Fig. 12a shows the signals obtained for the 4 modern charcoal samples after the air was removed by placing the samples
in a vacuum. This treatment removes the oxygen and reduces
its magnetic (dipoleedipole) influence on the paramagnetic
centers of the charcoal. The 4 modern charcoal samples all
have basically the same shaped signal, but the extent of broadening varies. The Ceratonia sample produced the narrowest
signal and the Quercus sample the broadest. Emmerich et al.
[11] have shown that this broadening can be attributed to the
presence of narrow and a broad components in the charred
samples they examined. The signal that contributes mainly
to the narrow component is affected by changing the measurement temperature, whereas the broad signal is not affected.
This means that the narrow component contribution behaves
in a CurieeWeiss manner (Figs. 12b and 13). This behavior
is characteristic of free radicals i.e. unpaired electrons. The
broad line component is characteristic of free charge carriers
(near Pauli paramagnetism), which are believed to be localized
on the graphitic microcrystallites [11]. We confirmed the same
behavior for the Quercus and the Ceratonia modern charcoals.
A well defined parameter of an ESR spectrum is the socalled g-value, which is dependent on the atomic and crystallographic system in which the electron is located. It is

therefore characteristic of a particular atomic site. Schurr et al.
[27] showed that in pyrolysed plants the g-value is related to
the remaining oxygen, and as the pyrolysis temperature increases, the g-value decreases and approaches g0. The g0 value
is that of a free electron and has a value of 2.0023. Table 3
shows the g-values for the 4 modern charcoal samples. These
values have small but significant differences. As the values are
close to the value of a free electron, we conclude that the signal in modern charcoal is mainly derived from the free electrons associated with aromatic p radicals in both phases
[11]. We also conclude that the Quercus sample was formed
at the highest temperature as it has the largest amount of
free charge carriers. The latter, according to Singer and Wagoner [30], are located only in the graphite-like microcrystallites. The concentration of the paramagnetic centers was
found to be 1018 spin/mg (Table 3). We also examined the dependence of the ESR signal intensity on microwave power
(saturation curves). The modern sample did not reach saturation (Fig. 14). This can be explained by a high local concentration of paramagnetic centers, that makes spin-lattice
relaxation time (T1) shorter. In general, the ESR characteristics
of modern charcoal are dominated by the behavior of free
electrons associated with both the graphite and the non-organized phases, and free charge carriers associated only with
the graphite-like microcrystallites.
The fossil charcoal ESR signal after treatment in vacuum
and HCl is broad, DH Z 8G (Fig. 15). The concentration of

the paramagnetic centers is more than 2 orders of magnitude
less than the concentration in modern charcoal (1016 spins/
gr) before treatment with HCl and 1 order of magnitude less
(1017 spins/gr) after treatment with HCl. The fossil charcoal
g-value (w2.0034) is higher than that of modern charcoal
(w2.0023) (Table 4). We note that this difference in g-values
is significant and is indicative of different chemical environments. This implies that some of the radicals are not located
in an aromatic environment since their g-values no longer reflect the environment of free radicals. The latter is stabilized in
an aromatic environment. The fossil charcoal does saturate
(Fig. 16) thus revealing a completely different behavior as
compared to modern charcoal. This means that these samples
have a relatively long relaxation time (T1). This behavior is
characteristic of ‘‘diluted’’ spin systems which couple weakly
with the surroundings. Clearly the atomic structure of the graphitic microcrystallites has been radically altered in the fossil
charcoal due to some diagenetic processes.
4. Discussion
Both the modern and the fossil charcoal samples comprise
two different phases; a crystalline phase composed of graphite-like microcrystals, and a non-organized phase. Despite
this, the analyses of modern and fossil charcoals reveal differences, some of which are most striking. Here we first discuss
modern charcoal structure and then fossil charcoal structure,
and by comparing the two, we identify some of the prominent
diagenetic processes that affect fossil charcoal.
4.1. The influence of HCl treatment
The treatment with HCl removes the carbonates (mostly
ash calcite) and makes possible the examination of the charcoal alone. This treatment in modern charcoal indeed removed
only calcite (as shown by FTIR). In fossil charcoal, however,
the HCl treatment may have an additional, as yet not understood effect that results in the release into solution of some
of the degradation products.
4.2. Modern charcoal structure
The TEM images clearly show that Franklin’s model [13]
for charcoal formed at high temperatures (Fig. 1) is basically
applicable to charcoals formed in natural fires. The major difference is that the proportion of the non-organized phase in the

latter is much higher due to the lower temperatures at which
the natural charcoals form. The graphite microcrystallites are
very small in modern charcoal. Direct observations by TEM,
as well as indirect observations by Raman spectroscopy indicate that the average crystallite size of the sheets is around
4e5 nm. We know very little about the chemical structure of
the disordered organic component. It has been suggested that
aromatic groups are common [23]. Clearly much still remains
to be understood about the chemical nature of this component
and how it is bound to the graphite-like crystallites.
In general the 4 samples of modern charcoal analysed here
are similar. We did, however, detect small but significant differences that probably reflect mainly varying proportions of
the two different phases. This is especially apparent in the
DTA measurements. We assume that the lower the temperature
of the major DTA peak, the larger is the proportion of the disordered organic component. This assumption is supported by
the relation between electrical resistivity and the major DTA
phase change temperature (Fig. 17). The larger the relative

amount of non-organized organics, the higher is the electric
resistivity, since this phase probably interrupts the contacts
between the graphite-like microcrystallites. Both the electrical
resistivity and the ESR measurements provide information on
the organization and on the atomic structure of the graphitelike component. They support the notion that the graphitelike component closely resembles geological graphite, except
for the small size of the crystallites. We did note variations in
the graphite-like crystallite properties (mainly peak widths)
using Raman spectroscopy. As the narrower the peak, the
more it resembles geological graphite, we conclude that the
most ordered graphite component is present in Quercus, then
in Laurus, followed by Ceratonia and the least ordered graphite component is present in the Olea sample. These differences
are also detected by the ESR measurements. The Quercus
charcoal sample, which is also the most conductive sample,
contains the most free electron charge carriers. These are
formed at higher temperatures and contribute to the reduction
in electric resistivity. This again implies that the Quercus

sample contains larger amounts and/or more ordered graphite
microcrystallites. We do not know what properties of burning
oak are responsible for this difference.
We conclude that modern charcoal is, as described previously [13], composed of two phases: an organized phase,

which is composed of graphite-like microcrystallites, and
a non-organized phase. These two phases are connected and
the relative amounts of each change the charcoal properties.
We use this model of charcoal to better understand the degradation processes in fossil charcoal.

4.3. Fossil charcoal structure
As graphite is one of the most stable materials in nature [9],
our initial hypothesis was that fossil charcoal samples will
contain a larger proportion of graphite-like microcrystallites
compared to modern charcoal, and that the non-organized
phase will be reduced as it is most susceptible to diagenetic
degradation. In fact almost all the measurements we made
on fossil charcoal point to the opposite scenario, namely the
fraction that degrades most is the graphite-like phase.
The fossil charcoal samples clearly do have a crystalline
graphite-like phase. This is directly observed in the TEM
and indirectly inferred from the Raman spectra. Its electrical
properties are, however, severely altered. The huge increase

in electrical resistivity compared to the modern charcoal
shows that this phase is almost incapable of conducting electrons. The ESR analyses provide information on the atomic
environment of the graphite-like crystallite, and these also
show that it has been drastically altered. The concentration
of free electrons decreased by 1 order of magnitude, and the
local environment in which they exist is quite different (as inferred from the higher ESR g-values and the saturation behavior of the fossil samples).
The infrared spectra provide the most direct evidence pertaining to the actual change. The fossil samples have distinct
carboxylate absorptions that are not present in the modern samples. This implies that the charcoal has undergone oxidation.
Although we do not have direct proof that this oxidation affected the graphite phase, the observed changes are consistent with
the graphite crystallite surfaces undergoing oxidation and thus
affecting free electron movement and hence resistivity.
The relative proportion of the non-organized phase of the
fossil samples appears to increase, based on the trends observed mainly from the TGA and DTA analyses. The TGA
analyses point to an increase of about 10 weight% of this

phase in the samples measured. This in turn raises the question
of whether or not this is due to the introduction of humic acids
from the surroundings, or due to the breakdown of the graphitic component of the charcoal itself, or both. One indication
that breakdown of the graphitic phase most likely occurs is
that during the AAA treatment of some fossil charcoals (not
those analysed in this study), it has been observed that the
alkali extraction steps can remove up to 80 or 90% by weight
of the sample. It is unlikely that this can all be attributed to
extraneous humic acid contamination. Furthermore, according
to Alon et al. [1] the high fluorescence levels detected in the
Raman spectra of fossil charcoals are not removed even after
several alkali treatments. Since all of the humic substances
from external sources should be removable after such treatment, the high fluorescence level is most likely derived from
an integral part of the original material. We also observed
that Raman spectra of ‘‘humic acid’’ extracted from archeological charcoal by alkali contain, besides a high level of fluorescence, the two characteristic peaks of graphite, similar to
the fossil charcoal samples (Fig. 6). Thus the alkali treatment
may also be removing degraded charcoal phases that have disaggregated into fine particles.
All these observations lead us to conclude that charcoal,
and in particular the graphitic component, degrades via oxidation into material resembling humic acid. This model is schematically illustrated in Fig. 18. It may be that ‘‘humic acid’’
derived from charcoal differs from soil humic acid by having
a crystalline graphitic phase. Haumaier and Zech [15] suggested that as soil humic acid is highly aromatic, it may be derived from charred plant residues. Kumada [19] and Shindo
et al. [29] arrived at a similar conclusion after comparing
humic acid compositions from charred residues to humic substances from volcanic ash soils. As charcoal is known to be an
excellent absorber of ions and other organic molecules, it most
likely also contains soil derived humic and fulvic molecules.
Our results, however, point to the possibility, that particularly
in more degraded fossil charcoal samples, the major source
material for increasing the proportion of the non-organized

phase, may be the result of ‘‘self-humification’’ of mainly the
graphitic component of the charcoal.
4.4. Broader implications
We have analysed charcoal samples from 3 other sites in
Israel (Tel Rehov e 2800e2900 BP, Motza e 9000e9300 BP
and Ohalo IIe 23,000 BP uncalibrated), and one from Georgia
(Ortvale Klde e 21,000e40,000 BP uncalibrated). We found
that basically the properties we report here are similar to those
we measured for charcoal samples from these sites. We therefore
believe that Tel Dor and Kebara Cave specimens are representative of many fossil charcoal specimens.
It is possible that this ‘‘self-humification’’ process is accelerated in a basic environment. In Kebara Cave for example,
charcoal is rarely found in sediments with calcite and carbonated apatite (implying a neutral to basic environment), but is
more common in sediments that were in an acidic environment
[25]. Heinrich [16] found that electrolysis of carbon black under basic conditions produced humic acid, but not under acidic
or neutral pH.
In many archaeological sites, and especially in prehistoric
caves, black organic-rich layers are present. The diagenetic
trends reported here raise the question as to whether at least
some of these originate from degraded charcoal. It is interesting to note that in Kebara Cave, one such organic-rich layer
contains diatoms and is therefore most likely derived from
organic-rich sediment formed in a pool, whereas many of
the other organic-rich black layers are intimately associated
with hearth structures [2]. These may be derived from charcoal; a subject we are currently investigating.

4.5. Implications for radiocarbon dating
If this model is correct, then much of the material extracted
by alkaline treatment of poorly preserved wood charcoal samples, may actually be the original charcoal itself, but in a more
degraded form. If this is not contaminated with other carbon
sources, it should provide a reliable date. The problem, however, is that such charcoal derived ‘‘humic substances’’ may
not be distinguishable from soil derived humic substances.
On the other hand, selecting well preserved wood charcoal
specimens after HCl treatment based on low resistivity, high
DTA transition temperatures or on narrow ESR profiles, and
then treating only these with alkali, will improve the chances
that the contaminating humic substances will be effectively
removed by the alkali and the date obtained will be reliable.
In practice, a good criterion for well preserved charcoal may
be a sample that loses minimal weight after the alkali extraction steps have removed all the colored substances.

5. Conclusions
A comparison of modern and fossil charcoal produced in
campfires reveals the following:
1. Both modern and fossil charcoal have basically the same
structure: graphite-like microcrystallites and a nonorganized phase.
2. The fossil charcoal contains abundant carboxylate groups,
which are absent in modern charcoal, implying that
diagenesis involves oxidation.

I. Cohen-Ofri et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 33 (2006) 428e439

3. The graphite-like phase of the fossil charcoal has higher
electrical resistivity, and its ESR properties show that it
has a markedly altered surface electronic state. This we
attribute to oxidation.
4. The data indicate that the proportion of the graphite phase
is reduced during diagenesis relative to the non-organized
phase. This may involve a ‘‘self-humification’’ process,
whereby the graphite component and possibly the nonorganized phase, degrades into humic substances.
