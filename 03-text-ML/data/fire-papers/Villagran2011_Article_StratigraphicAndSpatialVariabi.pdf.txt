compared to information gathered from ethnology,
macroscopic observations made during excavation, and
experimental modern analogues. All these lines of
evidence were combined for the first time at Tunel
VII, an eighteenth/nineteenth century shell midden
occupied repeatedly by Yamana people, the last hunter–
gatherer–fisher groups of the Beagle Channel. The
sampling strategy involved three sets of samples: (1)
two stratigraphical columns taken from the hut “entrance”
and from a portion of the shell midden (i.e., the
surrounding refuse shell ring), (2) thin sections from five
hearths representing successive phases of frequentation of
the hut, and (3) experimental burnt valves of Mytilus
edulis, the main malacological component of the site.
Comparison of microfacies from groups (1) and (2)
provided microscopic indicators to distinguish between
shell dumping areas and occupation surfaces. Comparison
of microfacies within columns from group (1) allowed
recognizing periods of site abandonment and periods of
more intense/longer site frequentation. The experimental
samples from M. edulis served as a reference to
characterize the five central hearths in terms of maximum
burning temperatures reached. Different burning structures were correlated to the season of hut frequentation
and to their location (and function) within different
portions of the hut. The intra-site micromorphological
comparison strategy within a well-documented ethnohistorical context provides valuable indicators for the
identification of functional areas in archaeological contexts when ethnographical information is not available.

Introduction
Geoarchaeological research on shell middens has mostly
focused on two subjects: environmental reconstructions
based on shell assemblages, used as indicators of past
climatic conditions, and the relationship between sedimentary evolution and human occupation of coastal settings,
based on the definition of sea-level fluctuations (see
Bateman et al. 2008; Butzer 2004; Cannon 2000; Compton
and Franceschini 2005; Cortez-Sanchez et al. 2008;
Erlandson et al. 2005; Fedje and Christensen 1999; Morey
and Crothers 1998; Whittaker and Stein 1992, among
others). Research has also been done to distinguish
anthropogenic from natural shell deposits (Henderson et
al. 2002; Rosendahl et al. 2007) and to understand
archaeological stratigraphies and site formation processes
(Morey et al. 2002; Stein 1992a, b, c, 1996; Stein et al.
1992; Vila et al. 2010). Much less investigation has been
conducted on cultural refuse deposition patterns and the
meaning underlying the construction of shell middens,
frequently conceived as mono-functional sites resulting
from the sequential accumulation of dumped food items.
Zooarchaeological analysis has traditionally been used to
study human behavior underlying shell accumulations,
specifically with respect to prehistoric subsistence, foraging
strategies, and resource intensification (see Bailey 1977;
Bicho 1994; Bird et al. 2002; Claasen 1986a, b; Gassiot and
Estevez 2005; Jerardino 1997; Jerardino et al. 1992;
Kennett 2005; Milner et al. 2007; Reitz 1988; Stiner et al.
2003; Waselkov 1987, among others). In this respect,
spatial variation within shell deposits remains an underexplored subject. Tonner (2005) provides an example of
spatial analysis in shell middens at Dunefield, Western Cape
(South Africa), a shell midden site occupied between ca.
1,400 and 1,300 AD. The author studies refuse management by spatially analyzing shell assemblages from a large
excavation area, thus identifying functional areas such as
living floors and specific locations for food processing and
waste management.
In this paper, we propose a geoarchaeological approach
to the spatial analysis of Tunel VII, an ethnohistorical shell
midden located on the northern coast of the Beagle Channel
(Tierra del Fuego, Argentina; Fig. 1a; Estévez and Vila
1996). The site dates to the eighteenth/nineteenth century
AD and has been ascribed to Yamana fisher–hunter–
gatherer groups, the inhabitants of the channel coastal areas
before and during European colonization (Fig. 1b, d, e).
European travelers, missionaries, and chroniclers, have
provided extensive ethnographic information relative to
these coastal populations, accounting for the social,
cultural, economical, and behavioral dynamics associated
to shell midden formation (e.g., Bridges 1975 [1947];
Darwin 1839; Despard 1863; Gusinde 1986 [1937];

Scientifique du Cap Horn 1882–1883)

Lothrop 1928; Martial 2005 [1888]; Spears 1895; Wilkes
1844). These sources describe Yamana shell middens as the
result of the sequential accumulation of debris around a
central living area (Fig. 1c, e). Each shell midden
corresponds to a hut built with logs, tree branches, and
animal skins where one to three families lived around a
central fire, constantly lit to provide heat and light
(Fig. 1c, d). Peripheral smaller auxiliary hearths would
also be lit for individuals that could not access the central
space (especially children; Hyades and Deniker 1891).
Some chroniclers report that mollusks were discarded
around the central living space to form ring-shaped shell
accumulations, which built a solid protection against
strong winds and running water. The archaeological record
from historic and older shell middens of the Beagle
Channel corroborates ethnographical descriptions of these
round huts where daily activities (e.g., stone knapping and
food preparation) were performed around a central hearth.
The secondary combustion areas have also been archaeologically identified in the periphery of the hut, even on top
of the shell ring (Estévez and Vila 2006; Estevez et al.
2001; Orquera 1996; Orquera and Piana 1996a, 1999a,
2000; Piana et al. 2000; Wunsch 1996).
The recent chronology of Tunel VII and its association with a well-documented ethnic group allows two
sets of data to be explored and integrated: archaeological and ethnohistorical. These sources are used here to
support the geoarchaeological study of spatial patterning
within shell middens based on microfacies (mF) characterization. The concept of microfacies is commonly
used to study the depositional and diagenetic histories
of carbonate rocks through sedimentological and paleontological data that can only be extracted from thin
section analyses (Flügel 2004). The concept was later
adapted to archaeological micromorphology by Courty
(2001) as a fundamental tool to understand the formation
of archaeological strata and their spatiotemporal variability, and it has been applied in several recent works
(Goldberg et al. 2009; Villagran et al. 2009, 2010).
Archaeological microfacies are defined by grouping
similar micromorphological characteristics in thin sections.
The similarities indicate an analogous origin for the
microfacies, meaning that the same deposition agent was

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2011) 3:357–378

responsible for its formation (Courty 2001). Therefore,
microfacies are not necessarily confined to specific portions
of the site stratigraphy and may appear recurrently in the
horizontal excavation and vertical successions. The characterization of archaeological microfacies is used in this
article to unmask the complexity that lies under the
supposedly simple accumulation of refuse and to expose
the intricate sequence of activities that may concur to the
formation of shell midden sites. In this respect, two lines of
evidence related to formation processes will be provided:
anthropic depositional and climatic post-depositional. This
information will be complemented by the correlation and
three-dimensional association of microfacies from stratigraphic profiles and from samples taken from inside the
central living space within the shell midden. This combined
approach will account for the complete depositional history
and evolutionary dynamics of site formation.

Tunel VII shell midden
Tunel VII is located on the northern coast of the Beagle
Channel (Fig. 1a), about 12 km east from the city of
Ushuaia (Tierra del Fuego, Argentina), in a coastal setting
currently dominated by cold sub-Antarctic climate (average temperature, 5°C; mean annual rainfall, 570 mm) and
intense winds (Heusser 2003). Tunel VII exemplifies the
last occupation phases of a long tradition of fisher–hunter–
gatherer populations that inhabited the channel coasts over
the past 6,500 years (Orquera and Piana 1999a). In
historic times, these populations became known as
Yamana, a nomadic society relying on the coastal
ecosystem and supported by canoes and specialized bone
and lithic technology. Their subsistence was mainly based
on sea mammal and guanaco hunting, fishing, mollusk
collection, and bird capture (Estevez et al. 1996, 2001;
Mameli and Estevez 2004; Orquera 1999; Orquera and
Piana 2000, 2001).
Tunel VII was excavated from 1988 to 1993 over a
surface of 72 m2 to investigate in detail the sequence of
occupation events and the distribution of activity areas. The
used method of excavation aimed at maximizing the
amount and definition of the recorded data (Orquera and
Piana 1992, 1996b). The general configuration of the site
reflects the patterns described in ethnographic sources: a
small entrance leading to the center of the hut (approx.
3.5 m in diameter) characterized by the presence of
successive hearths and a peripheral shell ring resulting
from the periodic accumulation of discarded food items,
charcoal, and other types of daily refuse. During excavation, researchers identified ten re-occupation episodes
spanning the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Estévez
and Vila 2006; Orquera 1996; Piqué 1999).

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2011) 3:357–378

The 30- to 60-cm-thick stratigraphy of Tunel VII can be
summarized as follows (from top to bottom): (a) reddish
brown colluvial sediments (layer A); (b) intra-stratified
shell midden (layer B); colluvial reddish brown palaeosol
(layers C and D); and (c) pebble beach (layer P). Layer B is
formed by an imbricate succession of shell lenses, shelldominated earths (20–50% fine fraction), black earths (with
a minor shell component), and pebble lenses (Estévez and
Vila 2000, Orquera 1996; Orquera and Piana 1996b, 2000).
The ten different occupation episodes were identified within
layer B in association to central hearths with accompanying
lenses of shell-dominated earths, faunal remains, and
artifacts. Thin lenses of black (organic) earths between
hearth layers were interpreted as representative of site
abandonment (Estévez and Vila 2006, Vila et al. 2010).
According to the archaeofaunal assemblages, the shell
midden hut was occupied temporally in different seasons for
resting, food preparation, tool production and maintenance.
Great amounts of wood from local tree species (mainly
Nothofagus sp.) were brought to the site to maintain the
fire of the central hearth constantly lit through the
occupation season (Piqué 1999). Tossing of discarded
food items and tool-making debris from successive
seasonal occupations led to the creation of the peripheral
shell rings (Estévez and Vila 2006). Archaeologists agree
with ethnographic accounts that such shell ring would
provide protection from the intense winds battering the
channel shore (Estévez and Vila 2006; Orquera and Piana
1999; Verdun 2010; Wunsch 1996).
The spatial arrangement of activities performed at Tunel
VII and their accompanying residues are thus ethnographically and archaeologically documented. This gives us the
chance of linking archaeological microfacies with specific
activity areas within the site and the opportunity to build a
framework for potential inferences of our micromorphological results to shell midden sites where ethnohistorical
information is missing.

Materials and methods
Undisturbed sediment samples for micromorphological
analysis were collected from Tunel VII during fieldwork
in 1992. The collection strategy involved vertical and
horizontal sampling to capture the sequential and spatial
distribution of activities within the shell midden. Two 60cm columns were collected from the south profile of the
shell midden (facing the beach): Column 11 (west column)
was taken from the shell ring access leading to the central
habitation area, and column 12 (east column) was taken
from the shell ring (Fig. 2a, c). Horizontal samples were
collected from five hearths identified in the central
habitation area during the excavation of the site (AC4,

examined in the present study have previously been
spatially analyzed by Wunsch (1996), Piqué (1999), and
Estévez and Vila (2006). Each hearth corresponds to five
(out of ten) occupation phases defined for Tunel VII during
excavation (Fig. 4).
Both sets of samples were oven-dried and impregnated under vacuum with a mixture of polyester resin,
catalyst, and acetone as diluent following procedures
described in Solé (1991). Thin sections were made in the

1990s at the Jaume Almera Institute of Geology (CSIC).
Analyses were done using a Leica MZ95 stereomicroscope and a Leica DM2500 optical microscope. Thin
sections were observed under plane-polarized light (PPL)
and cross-polarized light (XPL) following guidelines in
Bullock et al. (1985), Courty et al. (1989), Fitzpatrick
(1993), and Stoops (2003).
Thin sections from column 11 have been previously
analyzed (Balbo et al. 2010; Vila et al. 2010). These authors
identified three activities through a set of micromorpholog-

ical indicators, mainly based on the characterization of the
coarse fraction. The activities included: single tossing
events (low taxon variation, low fragmentation of shells in
banded subparallel distribution); frequentation phases (high
taxon variation, higher fragmentation of shell and random
distribution); and temporary abandonment of the site
(formation of angular blocky soil aggregates).
For the present study, the microstratigraphy of Tunel VII
is presented and discussed following archaeological microfacies identification (Courty 2001). The microstratigraphic
analyses of Balbo et al. (2010) are extended by defining

eight microfacies from column analyses and horizontal
samples (from the central hearths), which represent different activities within the shell midden. To define the
microfacies, we relied on differences of four main micromorphological characteristics:
1. Coarse fraction components: the diversity, frequency,
completeness, orientation, and distribution of these is
fundamental for microfacies description, and it gives
important clues to interpret the nature of the depositional activity.

(2006) in Tunel VII shell midden, with location of the central hearths
sampled for this study. AC10 corresponds to the hearth lit during the
inaugural occupation of the site; the fifth occupation (AC8) would
have occurred during winter; the sixth occupation (AC6) happening in
summer; the seventh occupation (AC5) in autumn; and eighth and nine
occupations (AC4) occurring very close in time, pointing to a
summer–spring frequentation of the site (Colonese et al. 2011; Estévez
and Vila 2006; Juan-Muns 1992; Mameli 2004)

4. c/f ratio: The relation between coarse and fine fractions
is fundamental to measure the variation between
microfacies that show the same composition, but that
may have been produced by different activities.

Results
Stratigraphy of the shell ring: column 12
Table 1 summarizes the micromophological description of
the seven thin sections analyzed from column 12. The
coarse fraction for all thin sections is composed of shells
(mostly mussels), rounded gravel-sized rock fragments,
charcoal, and some burnt bone fragments. Most fragmented
shell valves are complete and interconnected (interconnection means that the shells were broken but remained in
situ). Rock fragments are frequently cracked but not
displaced. The micromass is generally black (PPL),
opaque/cloudy, and undifferentiated, formed by fine granules of polymorphic organic matter, tissue residues, microcharcoal, and some fine bone fragments (Figs. 5, 6, 7, and
8). Some fungal spores were observed, especially in the
lower profile. A consistent pedofeature is the presence of
transparent (PPL) acicular calcium carbonate crystals (a few
micrometers thick and 20–40 μm long; Fig. 5c). The
predominant microstructure (interconnected mammilated
granules) is the result of biological action previously
observed in the upper horizons of regional soils (Villagran et
al. 2011). The recent chronology of the site has allowed the
good preservation of the original organic component in the
form of partially decomposed wood and forest litter (Fig. 6d).
Six microfacies were identified within the shell ring
stratigraphy (column 12) based on observed differences in:
(a) coarse fraction components, (b) microstructure, (c)
porosity, and (d) c/f ratio. Being the shell ring built from
residues originating from the central habitation area, the
observed microfacies may be associated to different
activities performed inside the hut.
2. Microstructure: It gives valuable information on the degree
of post-depositional transformations and pedogenesis.
3. Porosity: It helps in clarifying the anthropogenic compaction and/or biological alteration of the sediments.

abundant and randomly distributed shell and bone fragments (fine sand to silt-sized) embedded within a dark
brown, mostly organic fine fraction with many tissue
residues and acicular carbonate crystals inside that gives it
an overall crystallitic b-fabric (Fig. 5c). Coarse shell and

frequency of large shell valves (Fig. 2b, d), always
interconnected when fragmented. Shells are mostly subhorizontal (60% of the total; Figs. 6c, d and 7a–d), some
oblique (30%, Fig. 6a–c, e) and a few sub-vertical (10%,
Fig. 5d, e). Smaller shell fragments are also oriented,
though most of them are randomly distributed. Less than
2% of shell fragments show signs of burning. In some
cases, the periostracum of the shell is still preserved
(Fig. 7b). Charcoal fragments are larger and better
preserved here than in other facies. Rock fragments display
internal cracks, with accommodated planes, frost-shattering
(Van Vliet-Lanoë 2010), and no reworking. The fine
fraction is composed of mammilated fine granules (width,
150–250 μm) formed by a mixture of polymorphic organic
matter, micro-charcoal, and oxidized plant material. Only in
the lower parts of the profile does this facies include small
areas of micritic and sparitic carbonates (Fig. 8b).

This microfacies is <2 cm thick in both columns and is
always associated to mF 3 (either on top of mF 3 or
underneath). This facies is characterized by a high c/f ratio
and banded distribution of shell fragments, densely packed
and horizontal (Fig. 2b, d). The fine fraction is similar to
that described for mF 3, but is less abundant, and

mammilated granules are fine (100–150 μm) and loose
(Figs. 5d, e, 6c, d, and 8a, c)

Microfacies 6 (samples 5A and 6A of column 11)
This microfacies is exclusively located in the lower half
of column 11, and it has been previously studied in
Balbo et al. (2010) (Fig. 2b, d). It is fine fractiondominated, with randomly distributed fragmented shells
(10% burnt shell), pebbles, and charcoal with the same
micromass as mF 3.
The habitation area: hearths AC 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10
The micromorphological description of the five central
hearths from Tunel VII is summarized in Table 2. A
stark difference emerges between microfacies from the
shell ring and from the central hut depression. Burnt
shells, mostly highly fragmented mussel shells, prevail in
the central area. The fine fraction is composed of microcharcoal, micrite, and rubified clay with low frequency of
coarse charcoal fragments, seldom associated with a
spongy to chamber microstructure. Burning of mussel
shells is evidenced among others by the presence of interlaminar fissuration, laminar deformation, irregular texture,
reddish, dark brown and black coloration, and inner
pseudo-vacuoles (Villagran et al. 2011). Organic and/or
tissue residues are virtually absent. All rock fragments are
oxidized and in situ fissured into smaller angular fragments, indicating chemical and physical weathering,
probably related to exposure to repeated heating/cooling
cycles. Pedofeatures include impure calcitic coatings, ortic
iron nodules moderately to strongly impregnated (more

frequent in the lower hearths, AC8 and 10), impure calcite
and micro-charcoal coatings, and occasional acicular
calcium carbonate crystals, observed in the upper hearths
(AC4 and 5).
All hearths present strong similarities in coarse fraction
components and pedofeatures. Nevertheless, they can be
grouped into two microfacies (Fig. 3c–e) depending on
differences in:
(a) Frequency of shells burnt at temperatures above vs.
below 500°C,
(b) Porosity,
(c) Microstructure (intergrain microaggregate vs. chamber
microstructure), and
(d) Micromass composition (loose microcharcoal crumbs
vs. massive rubified clay and impure ash).
Microfacies 7 (samples AC4a,b,c,, AC5, and AC6a,b)
This comprised a mixture of burnt shell (at diverse
temperatures, but mostly above 200°C), rock fragments
(many of them oxidized and cracked), burnt bone, and
coarse charcoal (Figs. 9, 10, 11). Shells have a horizontal
distribution and shell fragments are interconnected
(Fig. 9b). The fine fraction has loose and interconnected
black granules and crumbs, mainly made of microcharcoal, oxidized tissue, and micrite (Fig. 9a, b).
Pedofeatures include impure calcite coatings, ortic iron
nodules inside micritic aggregates, and acicular calcium
carbonate crystals

within fine crumbs of microcharcoal. Most shell fragments were burnt

above 500°C in AC4 and 30% in AC5

Microfacies 8 (samples AC6a,b, AC8a,b, and AC10)
The coarse fraction is composed of randomly distributed
shell fragments burnt at temperatures in excess of 500°C,
oxidized and cracked rock fragments, burnt bones, and
weathered beach bones. The micromass is micritic impure
ash, micro-charcoal crumbs, and rubified clay with chamber
microstructure (Figs. 10 and 11). The presence of POCC
aggregates (see Canti 2003) suggests the good preservation
of ashes. Scarce coarse charcoal fragments (<2%) and the
absence of tissue residues, as in mF 7, indicate complete
combustion of organic components. Iron oxide nodules and
impregnative hypocoatings within ashes (moderately to
highly impregnated) are present, as well as remnants of
micro-laminated crescent-shaped calcitic coatings (Fig. 10).
Bioturbation is evidenced by channel and chamber voids
(Fig. 11a, b).

Thin sections from AC6 showed a mixed composition,
with equal proportions of loose microcharcoal crumbs and
coarse aggregates of micrite and rubified clay (Fig. 10). The
coarse fraction is a combination of that observed in mF 7
and 8, with shell burnt at medium and high temperatures,
oxidized and cracked pebbles, charcoal, and burnt bone.
This suggests that AC6 includes a reworked mixture of
both identified microfacies. Alternatively, these may represent different microfacies within the same combustion
structure.

Discussion
The micromorphological study of samples from Tunel VII
(following both vertical and horizontal distributions) allows
observing the arrangement of different components in terms
of microfacies within the shell midden. This geoarchaeological approach, supported with ethnographic data, reveals
how shell midden sites may provide information on a
variety of past human activities other than food consumption and tossing. Moreover, the micromorphological analysis of shell middens provides helpful information on site
taphonomy and intra-site environmental conditions.
Faunal composition of the shell midden
Most of the shell valves (around 95%) identified in thin
section are Mytilidae (mussels). The remaining proportion
(5%) belongs to other species of mollusks. The high
proportion of mussels in the thin sections is consistent with
previous archaeofaunal analyses from Tunel VII deposits,

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2011) 3:357–378

371

preserved following thermal alteration of hydroxyapatite,
enhancing bone resistance to dissolution (Berna et al. 2004;
Karkanas et al. 2000). This also indicates the higher
fragmentation of bones after burning, which can be related
to cleaning activities and re-deposition of the hearth
content, in conjunction with the tossing of bigger remains
outside the central area.
Stratigraphic microfacies

area of Tunel VII shell midden (AC8 and AC10) representing mF 8. a
AC8 with photomicrograph (PPL) of chamber microstructure (ch) with
burnt shell (bs), burnt bone fragments (bb), channel voids (cn), and
weathered beach bone (wb). b Thin section of AC10 with photomicrograph (PPL) of burnt shell (bs), rock fragments (r), and channel
voids (ch). The micromass of all samples for AC8 and AC10 is
composed of micritic impure ash, microcharcoal, and rubified clay.
Most shell fragments were burnt at temperatures above 500°C (100%
in AC8 and 50% for AC10)

with around 5% of bones (mammal, fish, and bird)
against 92% of mussels and 3% of limpets (Nacella
magellanica and Nacella deaurata—Gmelin, 1791) and
snails (Trophon geversianus and Acanthina monodon—
Pallas, 1774; Estevez et al. 1996; Orquera and Piana 2001;
Verdun 2006, 2010). Mussel valves are easily identified in
thin section thanks to their strong violet and pink color
(Figs. 5b, d, 6b, d, e, 7b, d, and 8b, c). Limpets are
identified by their shape (straight shell fragment when
broken and bent shell when complete) and yellowish brown
color (Figs. 6a and 7a). Snails are identified by undulated
surfaces and convoluted shapes (Fig. 5e).
Macroscopic bone remains in the faunal assemblage are
well preserved and just a low proportion of them is burnt
(Orquera and Piana 2001). However, most bone fragments
observed in the thin section show clear signs of burning
(Fig. 11a). These burnt bone splinters may have been better

Previous work on thin sections from Tunel VII showed that
at least three daily activities can be identified from the
study of its microstratigraphic succession, which include:
(1) tossing of discarded food items outside the hut, (2) site
frequentation (cleaning/maintenance of the central hut), and
(3) site abandonment (Balbo et al. 2010). The relationship
between microfacies and different activities was established
on the basis of characteristics of the coarse fraction
(frequency of components, fragmentation, compaction,
and interconnection of shell fragments), microstructure,
and c/f ratio.
The first microfacies (mF 1) is found within the upper
portion of column 11 (Fig. 2b, d), and it has a mixture of
shell midden components and fresh organic residues
(including wood and forest litter). This microfacies does
not seem associated with the formation of the shell midden,
but rather with the deposition of eroded shell midden
material and forest litter, covering mF 2, which represents
the final abandonment of the site.
All events identified as mF 2 (that appears three times in
column 11 and twice in column 12; Fig. 2b, d) correspond
to thin layers of fine colluvial and/or Aeolian sediment
deposited over the shell midden, especially in its central
area, during phases of site abandonment. This indicates that
the round shell midden functioned as a sediment trap,
concentrating fine sediments from the surrounding slopes
(mostly moraines and rock outcrops). The fine fraction
predominance of mF 2 favored the formation of angular
blocks (Figs. 5a, 7c, and 8a) as a result of frost desiccation
retraction (Van Vliet-Lanoë 2010) of the surface of the shell
midden. Thus, mF 2 corresponds to moments of site
abandonment, characterized by deposition of colluvial
and/or Aeolian sediments and the development of incipient
edaphic taits (i.e., a shallow angular blocky microstructure).
The stratigraphic correlation of columns 11 and 12
(dashed lines in Fig. 2b) indicates three moments of longterm site abandonment and middensol formation on the site:
one near the bottom of the shell midden; another in the
center of column 11, which correlates to the top of column
12; and a last one at the top of column 11. The correlation
of mF 2 at the center of column 11 (thin section 4A) with
the top of column 12 (thin section 2B) is marked by field
layer B35 (Fig. 2b, c), a concave-shaped, 2- to 3-cm-thick

372

black organic layer that covered almost the entire shell
midden. This layer contained the charcoal fragments used
for dendrochronological dating of the site (1776 and
1898 AD; Piana and Orquera 1996). The sequence of ten
occupations, and the five central hearths studied here, are
all situated under layer B35. This shows the dissimilarity
in the sedimentation rates of the central occupation area,
only 25 cm thick, and the peripheral shell ring, more than
40 cm thick.
Microfacies 3 dominates the two columns (Fig. 2b, d),
representing almost half of the shell midden profile in
column 12 and nearly a third of the profile in column 11.
The higher frequency of whole shells, the diversity and
random distribution of coarse fraction components (including many charcoal fragments, pebbles, and burnt bone), and
the fine loose granules of the micromass lead to the
interpretation that mF 3 represents tossing of discarded
items on the hut outer perimeter where the Yamana used to
deposit the waste of daily indoor activities. This fast and
conspicuous accumulation may have been motivated by the
desire to maintain a clear central area, but also to build a
protective basement wall for the habitation area (Bridges
1975 [1947]; Gusinde 1986 [1937]; Martial 2005 [1888]).
Microfacies 4 appears as 1- to 2-cm-thick lenses that are
always associated to mF 3, with the exception of the base of
column 12 (Fig. 2b, d). Shells in mF 4 have banded
distribution, are more compacted and more fragmented. The
fine fraction is less abundant than in mF 3. Therefore, mF 4
is interpreted as representing episodes of surface pressure
(trampling) that caused the fragmentation and compaction
of discarded shells. The episodic nature of these trampling
events is deduced from the fact that most shell fragments
are still interconnected, indicating little reworking. This
subtle feature can be used for the identification of
discontinuities between stratigraphic units during the
fieldwork.
At the base of column 12, mF 4 contains approx. 5% of
sea mammal bones showing calcite birefringence and wide
dissolution areas around osteons (Fig. 7b). These attributes
are associated to the mineralogical and morphological
characteristics of weathered bones from the beaches of the
Beagle Channel (Villagran et al. 2011). The presence of
weathered bones at the base of the shell midden is coherent
with the proximity of the underlying palaeo-beach substrate
and pebbles.
Microfacies 6 is the only one from the midden
passageway (column 11) that was not found in the
peripheral shell ring (column 12; Fig. 2b, d). Balbo et al.
(2010) interpreted the portion of column 11 (identified here
as mF 6) as representing moments of longer/more intense
frequentation of the site with reorganization of its microscopic components. The low c/f ratio of mF 6 and the
random distribution of complete and fragmented shell

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2011) 3:357–378

showing exposure to different temperatures support this
interpretation. Also, mF 6 contains the highest frequency of
burnt shell fragments of all column microfacies, indicating
its direct connection to the central hearths. Microfacies 6 is
present in the lower portion of column 11 and disappears in
the upper half of the midden stratigraphy, where mF 3
becomes dominant. This transition indicates that the central
hut was displaced and the passage way became part of the
peripheral ring of a nearby new hut. This inflection point in
the spatial organization of the shell midden (the transition
from mF 6 to 3 is manifested by field layer B35 (Fig. 2b, c).
Hearths microfacies
The five central hearths from Tunel VII analyzed here
(Fig. 3a, b) represent two microfacies (Fig. 3c–e). Apart
from AC6 (presenting traits of both mF 7 and 8), all
analyzed hearths belong to either mF 7 or mF 8.
Microfacies 7 is associated to the upper hearths (AC4
and 5) and includes burnt shell, pebbles, charcoal, and bone
fragments embedded in a micromass composed of fine
microcharcoal crumbs (Figs. 9 and 10). By comparison
with the experimental model of temperature-related transformations (of Mytilus edulis Linneaus, the main malacological component of Tunel VII) made by Villagran et al.
(2011), we infer that shell fragments in mF 7 were burnt at
moderate temperatures, not higher than 500°C. The overall
characteristics of the mixture of burnt components and the
absence of a rubified substrate indicate that this type of
hearths reached moderate temperatures (350–450°C according to classification in Wattez 1992).
Microfacies 8 is part of the lower group of hearths (AC8
and 10) and includes pebbles, burnt shell, and bone
fragments (Fig. 11) embedded in a low porosity micritic
micromass with rubified clay. According to the experimental model proposed by Villagran et al. (2011), shell
fragments in mF 8 were burnt at temperatures above 500–
600°C. The presence of shell burnt at high temperatures and
the observed rubification indicate that this type of hearths
represents high-intensity combustion structures (see Mallol
et al. 2007; Schiegl et al. 1996; Wattez 1992; Weiner et al.
2002). The overall good preservation of the microscopic
characteristics observed for mF 8 agrees with the taphonomic model from modern analogues proposed in Villagran
et al. (2011), i.e., the high porosity of shell middens and the
rain regime of the Beagle Channel allow the preservation of
combustion features or ash layers only if situated over a
clayey substrate in a calcium-saturated soil solution that
prevents carbonate leaching. Bioturbation, indicated by the
presence of channels and chamber voids, did not completely obliterate the original arrangement of materials.
The transition from hearth mF 8 to 7 is marked by a
layer of colluvial black sediments (Orquera 1996) that is

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2011) 3:357–378

restricted to the central habitation area (not visible in either
of the two columns at the peripheral shell ring). The fact
that type 7 is the only hearth microfacies observed on the
top of this layer could be explained by taphonomy and/or
past human action, though a combination of the two factors
is the most likely. In the first case, the predominance of
hearth mF 7 in the upper hearths could be related to a
reduced accumulation of colluvial sediments. Such reduction would have hampered the preservation of the upper
combustion structures since a decrease in the sediment
accumulation rate would have made the substrate more
porous, increasing the potential for erosion and leaching.
This situation is contrary to the circumstances in the lower
hearths where the presence of colluvial/Aeolian sediments
suggests higher sedimentation rates, less erosion, and better
preservation (see Mallol et al. 2007).
The situation mentioned above does not explain the
predominance of shell burnt at higher temperatures in the
lower hearths (mF 8). In this respect, the second scenario
would depend on the hearths above this layer of black
sediments systematically firing at lower temperatures than
those situated underneath. In fact, faunal and stable isotope
analyses show that occupation phases associated to AC5
and 4 correspond to autumn and summer/spring frequentation of the site, respectively. In contrast, AC8 corresponds
to a winter occupation phase (Colonese et al. 2011; Estévez
and Vila 2006; Juan-Muns 1992; Mameli 2004). This
suggests that the differences observed between mF 7 and
8 may be related to the changing heating needs of the hut
inhabitants, e.g. seasonal circumstances (winter hearths
demanding more intense fires) or hearth location within
the hut (secondary hearths being less intense). In this
scenario, the mixture of mF 7 and 8 observed for AC6
(Fig. 10) may indicate the reworking of residues from a
high-intensity hearth with the remains of a lower temperature hearth, two combustion structures lit simultaneously
within the hut during this occupation phase (see Fig. 4).
This mixture could be related to the daily occupation and
trampling inside the central hut.
Micromorphological traits as palaeoenvironmental proxies
The angular blocky aggregates that characterize mF 2
indicate the action of freeze–thaw processes in the shell
midden (Figs. 5a, c, 7c, f, and 8a, b; Van Vliet-Lanoë
2010). Lower concentrations of fine sediment in other
microfacies limited the post-depositional effects of freeze–
thaw cycles in other portions of the shell midden.
However, the random and/or vertical distribution of shell
fragments within mF 3 and 6, and the presence of frostshattered rock fragments may also be considered as
evidence of frost within the profile (Van Vliet-Lanoë
2010). The lack of silt coatings on blocky aggregates,

373

formed after micro-erosion and particle translocation by
repetitive freeze–thaw cycles, suggests that mF 2 represents single episodes of frost formation followed by rapid
cooling (Van Vliet-Lanoë 2010).
The physical distortion caused by frost action can also be
observed at a lower scale in the mollusk assemblages.
Acicular carbonate crystals observed extensively in the
shell ring and in the upper layers of the central habitation
area (Fig. 5c) are from the physical weathering of shell
valves. These acicular crystals appear as fine needles
detaching from shell valves and fragments, resulting in
random meshes of needles or massive single-crystal
accumulations within the matrix that suggest reworking
and redistribution of the original meshes. For their
appearance, these acicular crystals may be confused with
needle-fiber calcite, a type of authigenic carbonates (biomineralizations) formed by fungi in the rhizosphere during
the early stages of pedogenesis (Beckze-Deák et al. 1997;
Bajnócky and Kovács-Kis 2006; Jones and Kahle 1993;
Verrecchia and Verrecchia 1994).
In Tunel VII, the acicular carbonates are produced by
frost action that disaggregates the thin laminae of carbonate
crystals that compose the valves of mollusks. The weathered surface of the shell absorbs water molecules that enter
the intra-crystalline space. When water freezes and
expands, it causes the breakdown of the inner laminae,
releasing thousands of carbonate needles into the sediment.
The fine fraction of mF 2, where frost action is most
evident, shows the greatest concentration of acicular
crystals. This indicates intense freeze–thaw action that
affected both the sediment and the mollusk assemblage.
The preservation of acicular crystals at Tunel VII, in spite
of the constant rains and the low temperatures recorded in
the Beagle Channel (that would favor carbonate dissolution), is another indicator of calcium-saturated soil solution
inside the shell ring. This means that inside the shell
midden, the weathering is predominantly physical (postdepositional weathering is mainly related to freeze–thaw
processes) and only on a lesser scale due to carbonate
dissolution.
Freeze–thaw is not the only process affecting the
integrity of the shell midden. Biological action is also
evident, mainly in the peripheral part of the shell ring,
because of the interconnected granular microstructure
(Figs. 5e, f, 6b, d, e, and 7b, d). The high concentration
of organic material in this area of daily waste disposal
favors the action of microorganisms related to organic
matter decomposition and larger soil fauna. In the central
hearths, channel and chamber voids also denote the action
of soil organisms within the shell midden matrix. Here,
again, in spite of low temperatures, biological action is
common, as also observed in natural forest and prairie soils
of the Beagle Channel (Villagran et al. 2011).

374

Archaeol Anthropol Sci (2011) 3:357–378

Spatial differences within Tunel VII have emerged earlier
from the analysis of the relative composition of shell, bone,
pebbles, and fine sediment concentrations in sediment
samples from the central hut (14 samples that included

seven of the ten central hearths) and from the peripheral
shell ring (21 samples; Orquera and Piana 2000, 2001,
Verdun 2006, 2010). Verdun (2010) concluded that higher
densities of shells appear in the periphery (the shell ring),
while the highest frequency of pebbles and fine sediments
characterizes the central area. Likewise, correspondence and
principal components analyses showed the existence of a
strong inverted relationship between the number of shells and
the amount of pebbles and fine sediment (Verdun 2010).
The micromorphological analyses from this study show
other significant differences between the central area and
the periphery of the hut (Fig. 12). For instance, burnt shells
are virtually absent in the shell ring. The exception is for some
pieces in mF 6 (column 11) associated with the passage space
that connects the living hut, where the central hearths were
maintained constantly lit, with the exterior. Chroniclers
describe the practice of throwing mollusks into the fire to
open the shell and extract the meat (Gusinde 1986 [1937];
Martial 2005 [1888]; Wilkes 1844). However, the scarce

Fig. 12 Microfacies identified in Tunel VII shell midden from the
peripheral shell ring (sampling column 12), the passage way into the
hut (sampling column 11), and the main hearths at the central

habitation area (identified as AC4, AC5, AC6, AC8, and AC10). The
figure on the right side shows a reconstruction of the Yamana hut on
the shores of the Beagle Channel

Other pedofeatures in the central habitation area include
impure calcite coatings (Fig. 10), micro-charcoal coatings,
ortic iron nodules, and impregnative iron hypocoatings. All
these features are related to the constant rains that
characterize the climate of the Beagle Channel. In this
respect, iron nodules and hypocoatings denote episodes of
water saturation of the central area, more compacted than
the rest of the shell midden, while impure coatings show
the translocation of saturated soil material. The predominance of iron nodules and hypocoatings shows that water
saturation could have lasted for several days, but not long
enough to favor the depletion of iron (Lindbo et al. 2010).

evidence of heating in the shell fragments from the peripheral
ring may indicate that not all the mollusks that entered this
structure were in fact consumed or that the temperature in
which the mussels were heated was too low to alter the shells.
Microfacies analysis of the shell ring column indicates
its formation through the disposal of mostly unburnt
shells, pebbles, plant material, charcoal, and burnt bone.
Chroniclers have described these episodes (Bridges 1975
[1947], Despard 1863; Gusinde 1986 [1937]; Martial 2005
[1888]) as part of the maintenance routine of the living
space, occasionally leading to the formation of shell
mounds as tall as the huts. Concentrations of ash, clay,
and pebbles are higher in the central area, where they also
appear to be more compacted. These observations are
consistent with ethnographic accounts reporting that
Yamana fires were lit over accumulations of round pebbles
(Lovisato 1884) and shells (Bridges 1987 [1933]), and that
food waste was occasionally thrown into the fire (Gusinde
1986 [1937]). The existence of two types of hearths
emerges from the microfacies analysis proposed here.
Different combustion structures seem to have served
different functions, expressed in their maximum combustion temperatures (winter vs. summer hearths and main vs.
peripheral hearths).

Conclusion
The shell midden site Tunel VII comprises two main areas
that can be defined on morphological and compositional
grounds: (a) the peripheral shell ring and (b) the central
habitation area. Ethnographical sources describe these as
distinct areas in Yamana settlements. From our analyses,
differences between column microfacies (mF 1–6) and
hearth microfacies (mF 7 and 8) observed at Tunel VII
reflect the sedimentological and spatial complexity of
archaeological shell middens. The social space that is
defined by and comprised within the shell midden contains
a variety of sedimentary signatures that can be deciphered
through microfacies analysis, combining ethnographic and
geoarchaeological indicators. The micromorphological
analysis performed at Tunel VII gives the possibility of
characterizing spatial and sedimentary differences within a
shell midden that are elusive in the field and often
overlooked in the microscopic record. Even though most
components are common to the shell ring and to the central
hearths, differences in relative frequency, pre-depositional
alteration, arrangement, and preservation are significant
indicators of the intricate web of events that concur to
building the archaeological shell midden.
The existence of central and peripheral areas within
Yamana shell middens does not imply the discrimination of
one space in favor of the other. The space delimited by the

375

shell midden, the activities therein performed, and the
progressive accumulation of residues are mutually
connected and interrelated, and need to be considered as a
whole. The peripheral shell ring is genetically dependent
from the central area. This accumulation of residues would
not exist independently of the daily activities performed by
Yamana people living inside the hut. On the other hand, the
circular residue accumulation assumes a protective role
beyond its simple function as waste receiver. It may also
include components not related to consumption and daily
discard. More than being a mere area for the accumulation
of material not tolerated inside the living space, the circular
shell ring is charged with further function. Thanks to the
available ethnographic chronicles, we can link the sedimentary record with known anthropic features that allow us
to see the complete configuration of the site as a continuum
of daily processes, actions, and social space construction
among prehistoric fisher–hunter–gatherers.
The combination of ethnographic accounts with geoarchaeological observations, and by applying microfacies
analysis, allows the identification and corroboration of the
anthropic processes hidden behind the microstratigraphy.
It also helps verify features observed during excavation of
the site, such as layers of compacted shells, interpreted in
the field as trampling surfaces and used as a parameter for
the identification of stratigraphic units within the shell
midden. This approach confirms the validity of micromorphological analyses under such methodological premises
and extends the use of this technique for identification of
the processes that configured the social space of prehistoric fisher–hunter–gatherers.
