A major debate in prehistory revolves around the time and place of the earliest habitual use of ﬁre and
the hominin species responsible for it. Here we present a newly discovered hearth at Qesem Cave (Israel)
that was repeatedly used and was the focus of hearth-centered human activities, as early as threehundred-thousand years ago. The hearth, identiﬁed based on mineralogical and microscopic criteria,
contains two superimposed use cycles, each composed of shorter episodes e possibly the earliest
superimposed hearth securely identiﬁed to date. The hearth covers ca. 4 m2 in area making it a uniquely
large hearth in comparison to any contemporaneous hearth identiﬁed thus far, possibly indicating it has
been used by a relatively large group of people. In addition, the hearth is located in the center of the cave
and is associated with butchered animal remains and a dense ﬂint assemblage. The ﬂint assemblage
indicates spatially differentiated meat cutting and hide working activity areas. The central location of the
hearth within the cave and the activities associated with it may reﬂect an embedded perception of space
organization of the Qesem Cave inhabitants. Since ﬁre was habitually used throughout the 420e200 ky
sequence of Qesem Cave, where preservation conditions are alike throughout, we suggest that this
unique hearth may reﬂect a development in nature and most probably in the intensity of ﬁre use in
Qesem Cave, from ca. 300 ka ago onwards.

1. Introduction
A major debate is taking place in recent years concerning the
time and place of human early and habitual use of ﬁre. Early ﬁre
occurrences, dating between 1.7 and 0.8 My ago (Lower and Middle
Pleistocene) have been reported in sites such as Wonderwerk Cave
and Gesher Benot Ya’aqov (Alperson-Aﬁl et al., 2007; Alperson-Aﬁl
and Goren-Inbar, 2010; Beaumont, 2011; Berna et al., 2012; Chazan
et al., 2012; Goren-Inbar et al., 2004; Gowlett, 2010). These indicate
sporadic presence of ﬁre, for example as stated for the site of
Wonderwerk Cave “. burning took place within the cave during
the Early Acheulean, approximately 1.0 My ago” (Berna et al., 2012).
Such ‘early ﬁre’ occurrences (Gowlett, 2010) remained on the scene
until the late Middle Pleistocene and possibly as late as the Late
Pleistocene in the Old World, based on the currently available

evidence (Roebroeks and Villa, 2011). The turning point from ’early
ﬁre’ to the ’habitual use of ﬁre’ is a matter of dispute.
Roebroeks and Villa (2011) relate to the habitual use of ﬁre as a
’systematically repeated use of ﬁre in speciﬁc sites and/or regions’.
Based on an increased number of archaeological sites with evidence
for ﬁre, associated with evidence for ﬁre being extensively used in
domestic contexts, Roebroeks and Villa (2011) suggested that the
earliest habitual use of ﬁre occurs in Middle Pleistocene (ca. 400e
300 ky ago) Europe and southwest Asia and that this archaeological
signal becomes common and well established in sites younger than
100 ky. They thus view the habitual use of ﬁre as a common cultural
trait across wide geographical regions. On the other hand,
Sandgathe et al. (2011a, 2011b) argue that this archaeological signal
becomes well established in Europe only after mid MIS3.
Here we present new evidence for the repeated use of a large
central hearth at Qesem Cave as early as 300 ky ago. The importance of this ﬁnd lies with the fact that the feature presented below
is incorporated within a well dated stratigraphic sequence (Barkai
et al., 2003; Gopher et al., 2010; Merceir et al., 2013), is, to our
knowledge, the earliest of its kind identiﬁed to date, and is overlain

R. Shahack-Gross et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 44 (2014) 12e21

by a sedimentary sequence that has been previously proven to
include concrete evidence for the habitual use of ﬁre (Karkanas
et al., 2007).
1.1. Stratigraphy, spatial ﬁeld relationships, and associated
macroscopic remains
Qesem Cave is located at the foothills of the central mountainous ridge of Israel (Fig. 1a). It consists of a 9.5 m sedimentary
sequence divided into a lower (5 m thick) clay-dominated and an
upper (4.5 m thick) calcite-dominated sequence (Karkanas et al.,
2007). High-resolution U-series, thermoluminescence (TL) and
electron spin resonance (ESR) dates made on speleothems, burnt
ﬂint and teeth enamel (respectively), originating from the lower
and upper sequences, indicate that the border between the two
sequences dates to 300  30 ky (Barkai et al., 2003; Gopher et al.,
2010; see also Merceir et al., 2013).
The feature under study is gray-colored, covers an area of ca. 4
m2, and is located in the central part of the cave, away from cave
walls (Fig. 1b). It has been excavated in half, leaving it sectioned,
during the 2006, 2009 and 2011e2012 excavation seasons (Fig. 2a,
b). Stratigraphically, the feature is found at the topmost part of the
Qesem Cave lower sequence, thus dating to, or somewhat earlier,
than 300 ky ago. It is covered by ca. 10 cm of brown sediments
which are overlain by large boulders attributed to a major roof
collapse (Fig. 3; and see Frumkin et al., 2009; Karkanas et al., 2007).
Its total thickness is between 38 and 28 cm (between 560 and
598 cm below datum in the eastern part, and between 572 and
600 cm below datum in the western part). Sediments below
elevation 600 cm below datum were not yet excavated.
The feature is slightly inclined southwesterly (Fig. 2). The reason
for this tilt is still under study. In section, four macroscopic sublayers are identiﬁed from top to bottom: consolidated white sediment with bone-rich laminae, grayebrown crumbly sediment,
whiteegray consolidated sediment with bones, and brown crumbly

13

soft sediment (Fig. 2c). Within the light-colored macroscopic layers,
multiple thin laminae have been identiﬁed (Fig. 3). Bone colors vary
between white, gray, yellow, brown and black. Burnt ﬂint is
abundant.
The late use phases of the feature may have been delineated by a
row of stones, 10e20 cm in diameter, at its northern and western
edges, separating the whitishegray sediments characteristic of the
top part of the feature from the soft brown sediments immediately
to their north and west (Fig. 2a). Only a few stones of such a relatively large diameter have been recorded on top and within the
feature (Fig. 2a) while the sediment to its east is mostly devoid of
stones larger than 6.5 cm. This evidence rules out the possibility
that the apparent stone line is due to rock fall. An area measuring
slightly more than 1 m2 covered by generally ﬂat stones up to 40 cm
in size was exposed south and southwest of the feature (Fig. 2b) and
may be related to the feature under study.
The lithic assemblage from the feature and areas around it
consists of two distinct industries of the Acheulo-Yabrudian Cultural Complex e the blade-dominated Amudian (Barkai et al., 2005;
Gopher et al., 2005; Shimelmitz et al., 2011) and the Quina scraperdominated Yabrudian (Barkai and Gopher, 2011). Amudian items
related to the stratigraphic level of the feature occur within and
around it (in Squares E12, H8, J8 and M12; Fig. 1). Yabrudian lithic
assemblages are found a few meters away from the feature, in the
same stratigraphic level, under a natural rock shelf (in Squares E9,
G9, F10 and E11; Fig. 1). A speleothem that formed under the rock
shelf and directly overlies this stratigraphic level has been dated to
ca. 300 ky ago (Gopher et al., 2010).
The Amudian lithic assemblage is characterized by the production of sharp edges for cutting tasks, dominated by blades, and
includes small recycled ﬂakes. Functional (use-wear) analysis indicates that the activities performed by these artifacts at Qesem
Cave are mostly related to meat processing, butchering and cutting
(Barkai et al., 2010; Lemorini et al., 2006). The Yabrudian lithic
assemblage is dominated by Quina scrapers. Initial observations

The arrows on the lower left indicate the assumed area of the paleo-entrance to the cave. The area marked “Cemented Sediments” is an elevated lithiﬁed area that comprises most of
the upper stratigraphic sequence in the cave. The gray feature is located at the border between the upper and lower stratigraphic sequences.

(Lemorini, personal communication) indicate they have been used
in butchering activities (see also Claud et al., 2012; Rots, 2009 for
similar results from European Quina scrapers).
A large faunal assemblage, not yet including material from the
feature presented here, was studied by Stiner et al. (2009, 2011).
Faunal analysis showed that burnt bones (as well as burnt ﬂint;
Gopher et al., 2010) are present along both stratigraphic sequences
in Qesem Cave. Burning frequencies on bones differ by skeletal
element, mostly ranging between 5 and 25% of the total bone

assemblage, but on occasion can reach well over 50% (Stiner et al.,
2009). The percentage of burned bones is similar throughout the
two sedimentary sequences of the site (Stiner et al., 2009, Table 1;
pp. 13,208, except for the youngest level). Faunal analysis from the
feature presented here is currently underway.
Overall, the lithic assemblages related to the presented feature
have been studied in full, the bone assemblage is currently under
study, and below we present geoarchaeological data retrieved from
sediments sampled for laboratory analyses.

2. Laboratory materials and methods
An ongoing geoarchaeological study is carried out in Qesem
Cave. Sediments are routinely sampled in bulk and block formats
each excavation season, and used for a variety of analyses. Sediments from the feature presented here have been sampled from its
proﬁle. Bulk samples have been studied using Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy and subjected to phytolith analysis.
Bulk FTIR spectra were prepared using the KBr method. Spectra
were collected using a Nicolet 380 spectrometer at 4 cm1 resolution. Interpretation of spectra was assisted by a reference library
of minerals (Weiner, 2010). Phytoliths have been extracted
following the procedures of Albert et al. (1999) for samples
collected before 2009, and Katz et al. (2010) for samples collected
after 2009. The results from both procedures are comparable (Katz
et al., 2010). The same extraction procedures have been employed
on samples that represent all sediment types at the cave, from the
two stratigraphic sub-sequences, in order to compare the results
from the feature to other cave sediments.
Sediment block samples were collected and studied using both
the conventional petrographic method as well as the FTIR microspectroscopy technique. Three block samples were extracted from
the northern section of squares I-J 12 between the following elevations: 555e560, 562e570, 565e570 cm below datum. The blocks
have been impregnated by polyester resin mixed with acetone in a
8:2 (v:v) ratio and 1% (v:v) MEKP catalyst. Thin sections have been
prepared by Arizona Quality Sections (Tucson, Arizona) and
observed and described using a Nikon petrographic microscope
(Eclipse 50iPol) equipped with blue light for phosphate autoﬂuorescence observation.
FTIR microspectroscopy was conducted on polished thin sections using a Thermo-Nicolet Continuum IR microscope attached to
the Nicolet Nexus 470 FTIR spectrometer. Spectra of particles with
diameter of about 150 mm were collected with a Reﬂectocromat
15 objective in Total Reﬂectance and Transmission modes. The
spectra were collected between 4000 and 450 cm1 at 8 cm1
resolution. Interpretation is based on criteria established by Berna
et al. (2007, 2012).
Lithic densities within and around the feature were calculated
for a sample of over 60,000 items from 16 different assemblages
throughout the cave that have already been studied (see details on
sampled contexts in Table 3). The assemblages cover different areas

of the cave and large portions of the stratigraphic sequence. Thus
the lithic densities within the feature can be compared to densities
in other parts of the cave. Lithic densities were calculated as
number of items per cubic meter of excavated sediment.
3. Results
3.1. Bulk sediment analyses
Bulk Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analyses show that the
sediments composing the feature are dominated by the absorptions
of calcite and clay with minor amounts of dahllite and quartz
(Fig. 4). Bulk spectrum analysis indicates that clay minerals are
unburnt (based on criteria in Berna et al., 2007), and that calcite is
geogenic in origin (based on the method of Regev et al., 2010).
There is no absorption of opal, the mineral phytoliths are composed
of, in infrared spectra. Phytolith extraction indeed shows that
sediments from the feature, as well as from other parts of the cave,
are devoid of phytoliths (Table 1). Dissolution by acid shows that
the light gray and white consolidated sediment layers within the
feature are composed of more than 70% (by weight) acid soluble
minerals (i.e., calcite and dahllite). The darker brownish layers in
the feature include lesser amounts of these minerals averaging less
than 60% by weight. Gray-colored bones are calcined, based on bulk
FTIR analysis (see e.g., Karkanas et al., 2007).
3.2. Micromorphology
The laminations observed macroscopically in the grayewhite
layers of the feature are also clear on the mesoscopic level (Fig. 5a).
Micromorphological observations show that the calcitic component in the grayewhite layers is dominated by wood ash. This
component appears either as re-crystallized wood ash (i.e., a gray
micritic dirty microscopic appearance) or as clear ash pseudomorphs (Fig. 5c, d). Horizontally oriented delicate long pseudomorphic structures of ashed plant tissue indicate that ﬁre occurred
in situ (Fig. 5c). Micro-charcoal is present (Fig. 5c). Charred bones
are abundant and are sometimes layered sub-horizontally, intimately mixed with ash remains and a few micro-ﬂint ﬂakes (Fig. 5b,
e). Quartz grains are associated with clay granules (Fig. 5e). The
quartz grain sizes range mostly between 2 and 120 mm, a range
similar to that of quartz grains in terra rossa soil that overlies the

cave area. This indicates that the origin of the clay and quartz association is from terra rossa soil that inﬁltrated into the cave. The
overall microstructure is compact indicating an in situ rather than a
turbated (dumped) sediment.
The darker colored brownish layers of sediment identiﬁed in the
feature also contain ash and burnt bones but in lesser amounts, is
not microlaminated and is mixed with a higher amount of clay and
quartz.
Post depositional changes to the original wood ash, bones, and
limestone fragments are evident through the following observations. The ash has been partially re-crystallized by reaction with
percolating water in the karstic cave system resulting in the precipitation of sparitic calcite, hence the bulk FTIR identiﬁcation of
calcite as of geogenic origin (Fig. 5def). Percolating water included
phosphate, indicated by the formation of phosphate nodules and
reaction rims (Karkanas et al., 2002; Schiegl et al., 1996; Weiner
et al., 1993) around bedrock limestone fragments (Fig. 5a). This
phenomenon is common in karstic caves and indicates that this
area was once rich in organic components that upon degradation

released phosphate into the soil solution (Karkanas et al., 2000;
Shahack-Gross et al., 2004). Minor staining of bones and stones
by manganese oxides was observed as well, indicating periods of
reducing conditions that often occur in water inundated sediments
(Fig. 5f). Water percolation and its chemistry is therefore the
driving force that affected the preservation of original materials in
the feature (see more in the Discussion).
3.3. FTIR microspectroscopy
Micro-FTIR analyses conducted directly on thin sections supported and ampliﬁed the evidence obtained through conventional
micromorphological petrographic analysis (Table 2). Direct analyses of bones within the grayewhite layers of the feature show
that more than 60% of the bones have witnessed temperatures
above 500  C, while the rest of the bones may have been either
charred at temperatures below 500  C or unaltered by heat (Fig. 6).
Direct analyses of reddened soil aggregates within the grayewhite
layers of the feature show that almost all of the analyzed aggregates
witnessed temperatures close to or below 400  C. A few localities
within the thin sections do show alteration of clay minerals at
temperatures between 400 and 700  C (Fig. 6).
3.4. Lithic density analysis
Lithic density in the feature is 6922 ﬂint items per 1 m3 of
sediment while the density of lithics away from the feature ranges
between 232 and 5866 ﬂint items per 1 m3 in different parts of the
cave (Table 3). The average total density of ﬂint items across the
cave is 2499  2021 (1s) per 1 m3, signiﬁcantly lower than the lithic
density within the feature. A detailed discussion on the densities of
each assemblage, especially those showing a relatively high density
[K/10 (300e420); F-G/9-11 (535e655)] is beyond the scope of this
paper.
4. Discussion
An array of independent lines of evidence is presented here for a
large, central, repeatedly used combustion feature dating as early as
300 ky ago in Qesem Cave. To our knowledge, this may well be the
earliest superimposed hearth identiﬁed thus far. The evidence for
this feature being a hearth in primarily the two microlaminated
grayewhite layers composed of in situ wood ash that includes
charred and calcined bones, microcharcoal, burnt ﬂint, and burnt
microscopic clay aggregates. The micro-FTIR data indicates a temperature range that exceeded 500  C.
The evidence presented here shows at least two major cycles of
intensive ﬁre use, in the form of two superimposed light-colored
ash-dominated sediment layers. The upper cycle seems to have
been partly demarcated by a row of stones. The lower cycle was not
fully excavated, in order to preserve the feature for future studies,
thus evidence for stone lining of the lower parts of the feature is
currently unavailable. The darker colored sediment between the
two ash-dominated cycles is mostly composed of inﬁltrated terra
rosa soil, thus indicating a time gap between the two intensive use
cycles. The two clear cycles of use are relatively thick (ca. 5 cm each,
compared for example to less than 2 cm in deeper layers of Qesem
Cave and ca. 2 cm thick ash layers in stone-lined hearths at Bolomor
Cave Level XIII, MIS 7; Fernández Peris et al., 2012). Furthermore,
each of these cycles includes internal microlaminations (e.g., Figs. 3
and 5a, b and c) indicating that each cycle represents repeated
consecutive use episodes. The preservation of delicate long pseudomorphic structures of ash and the compact bedded structure
indicate an in situ combustion feature rather than a dumping activity (e.g., Meignen et al., 2007). Despite post-depositional

processes, the microstructure, the major material components
and their change due to heating, were not obliterated. Yet, these
indicators for ﬁre use were identiﬁed primarily based on
contextualized methods (micromorphology and FTIR microspectroscopy) rather than bulk sediment analyses.
On a broader level, this newly identiﬁed combustion feature
ﬁts well with evidence for the habitual use of ﬁre throughout the
Qesem Cave stratigraphic sequence. It has been previously shown
that small and thin, restricted and discrete lenses of ash, ca. 10e
40 cm in diameter and up to 2 cm thick, associated with burnt
bones and microcharcoal are found in the lower sedimentary
sequence of the cave, predating the hearth presented here
(Karkanas et al., 2007; pages 200, 206 and appendix), while ashdominated sediments indicating an intensive use of ﬁre including
several possible intact hearths were found in the upper sedimentary sequence postdating the hearth presented here
(Karkanas et al., 2007). In addition, both sedimentary sequences
include large percentages of burned bones and burnt ﬂint
(Gopher et al., 2010; Stiner et al., 2009, 2011).
4.1. Anthropological implications
Qesem Cave has provided solid evidence for the habitual use
of ﬁre throughout its stratigraphic sequence (Karkanas et al.,
2007). Yet, the data provided above may suggest a development in nature and most probably in the intensity of ﬁre use in
this site, from ca. 300 ky ago onwards. This newly identiﬁed
hearth is unique and outstanding on several grounds. First, it is
large (4 m2; maximal diameter of 2 m), much larger than any
contemporaneous hearth worldwide. This may indicate that
activities around this hearth were associated with a relatively

large group of people. This suggestion may be supported by the
high lithic densities associated with the hearth, compared to other
parts of the cave, and by the thickness of the ash-dominated
layers, both indicating intensive human activities. Future spatial
micromorphological research will test whether the large hearth
area was formed by single superimposed continuous laminae or
palimpsests of laminae. This will help to deﬁne better the human
group sizes that frequented the cave. Second, the hearth is
superimposed, indicating a repeated use of the same space for the
same purpose. The data suggests that activities associated with
this hearth were spatially differentiated, including meat cutting
(i.e., an area dominated by the Amudian blade industry), butchering (i.e., an area dominated by the Yabrudian scraper industry),
food processing, possibly cooking (e.g., Speth, 2012), and consumption. Third, the hearth is re-used in the same location, in the
center of the cave. This may indicate that the hominins frequenting Qesem Cave ca. 300 ky ago not only used ﬁre habitually
but have possibly had a long-term perception of space organization. A sense of spatial planning may be related to the fact that
unlike open-air sites, a cave is restricted in space and the placement of such a large hearth in its center must involve planning.
Certain cave features had to be taken into consideration while
deciding where to locate the hearth, such as the location of cave
opening(s), additional chambers, cave inner topography, location
of fallen boulders, and other possible features.

4.2. Preservation and archaeological visibility of contemporaneous
hearths
Water percolation is the major force behind post-depositional
changes observed in the sediments of the presented hearth. It
promoted two chemical diagenetic processes. One is the formation
of phosphate nodules and crusts indicating that degradation
products of organic matter were present. These were most probably related to bat guano (Shahack-Gross et al., 2004 and references therein) which accumulated on the hearth and its
surroundings in periods of minimal or no human activity in the
cave. Karkanas et al. (2007) have shown that during the period of
formation of the lower sequence at Qesem Cave, the cave was
rather closed and dark, an environment suitable for bat habitation.
Microfaunal studies show that the cave was inhabited by at least 6
species of bats when the lower sequence was forming (Horá
cek
et al., 2013). The other diagenetic process that has been acting
upon the sediments of the hearth and its vicinity is partial
dissolution and re-crystallization of calcite. This process resulted
in cementation on the one hand, and dissolution of phytoliths on
the other. Unlike many other prehistoric cave settings in the
southern Levant, and despite continuous efforts to separate phytoliths from Qesem Cave sediments, all samples thus far studied (a
total of 30 samples from various locales and elevations within the
cave) turned out to be devoid of phytoliths (Table 1). Studies have
shown that dissolution of opal, the mineral phytoliths are
composed of, is accelerated in alkaline conditions (Krauskopf,
1979). Wood ash is extremely alkaline having a pH range of 9e
13 (Etiegni and Campbell, 1991). The karstic water system at
Qesem Cave was highly active (Frumkin et al., 2009), therefore the

water alkalinity (buffered to pH 8.2 due to the bicarbonate system)
together with the high alkalinity of wood ash, would potentially
cause phytolith dissolution and their dissolution products would
have been washed away. Moreover, Cabanes et al. (2011) recently
showed that burnt phytoliths may be more soluble than unburnt
phytoliths, thus in an active hydrological system such as at the
karstic Qesem Cave, the absence of phytoliths can best be
explained as a result of phytolith dissolution. At these alkaline
conditions, ash and bones are in good states of preservation, as
indeed observed in the hearth studied here.
Comparison between the ﬁnds at Qesem Cave and other relevant, largely contemporaneous sites, seems to indicate that preservation conditions play a major role in the ability to identify
hearths in Middle Pleistocene sites. The evidence for ﬁre use in
southwest Asia and Europe from sites that are contemporaneous
with Qesem Cave is fragmentary. This may result from a real
absence of evidence for habitual ﬁre use and/or from postdepositional processes (Roebroeks and Villa, 2011). In the southern Levant, the Tabun Cave layer E, generally contemporaneous
with Qesem Cave sequence (and the slightly earlier layer F), have
undergone severe diagenesis so that calcitic ash, if deposited there
in the past, was dissolved (Goldberg and Nathan, 1975). Two
possible separate hearths have been identiﬁed in these layers of
Tabun Cave based on their black lens-like appearance associated
with elevated organic matter content (Ronen and Tsatskin, 1995).
Layer G at Hayonim Cave, possibly partly contemporaneous with
Qesem Cave dating to more than 220 ky ago, is composed mostly of
geogenic materials that bear evidence for mild chemical diagenesis
but it has not provided evidence for either hearths or ash (Mercier
et al., 2007; Weiner et al., 2002).

20

R. Shahack-Gross et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 44 (2014) 12e21

Contemporaneous sites from areas other than the southern
Levant include the site of Beeches Pit (England), dated to ca. 400 ky,
reported to have hearths, charcoal, burnt ﬂint and charred and
calcined bones (Preece et al., 2006). Reddened features suspected
as hearths at Schöningen have not yet been studied using contextual geoarchaeological techniques. Other sites in Europe bearing
undisputable evidence for the use of ﬁre are younger than 300 ky
(Roebroeks and Villa, 2011). Archaeological visibility of Paleolithic
hearths may not only be determined based on paleo-chemistry, as
explained above and in various other studies. A sometimes overlooked mechanism that greatly affects degree of preservation relates to the rapidity of site burial or lithiﬁcation. In karstic caves, a
high water percolation rate promotes rapid lithiﬁcation of ash,
contributing to preservation of combustion features, as observed in
Qesem Cave. In open-air sites, rapid sediment inﬁlling in topographic depressions contributes to good preservation. This was
probably the determinant mechanism for the relatively good
preservation at Beeches Pit, and has been recently observed also in
a Middle Paleolithic site in Israel (Friesem et al., in press).
5. Conclusion
Evidence for the use of ﬁre at Qesem Cave seems to be less
frequent between 420 and 300 ky ago, with an important turning
point at ca. 300 ky ago marked by the hearth presented in this
study. This unique hearth, located centrally in the cave, having a
uniquely large size, being superimposed, bearing dense faunal and
lithic remains as well as evidence for spatial differentiation of activities around it, provides a glance onto the behavior of Middle
Pleistocene hominins in the southern Levant. The sedimentary
sequence post-dating this unique hearth at Qesem Cave is characterized by a high frequency of ash. The evidence presented here is
yet an additional aspect fortifying the overall economic, technological and social innovative records found so far at Qesem Cave
(Barkai and Gopher, 2013; Ben-Dor et al., 2011).
