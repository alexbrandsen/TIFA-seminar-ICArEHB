Compound-Adhesive Manufacture as a
Behavioral Proxy for Complex Cognition
in the Middle Stone Age
by Lyn Wadley
Compound adhesives were made in southern Africa at least 70,000 years ago, where they were used
to attach similarly shaped stone segments to hafts. Mental rotation, a capacity implying advanced
working-memory capacity, was required to place the segments in various positions to create novel
weapons and tools. The compound glues used to fix the segments to shafts are made from disparate
ingredients, using an irreversible process. The steps required for compound-adhesive manufacture
demonstrate multitasking and the use of abstraction and recursion. As is the case in recursive language,
the artisan needed to hold in mind what was previously done in order to carry out what was still
needed. Cognitive fluidity enabled people to do and think several things at the same time, for example,
mix glue from disparate ingredients, mentally rotate segments, talk, and maintain fire temperature.
Thus, there is a case for attributing advanced mental abilities to people who lived 70,000 years ago
in Africa without necessarily invoking symbolic behavior.

Introduction
What is complex cognition? The type of cognition attributed
to people who think like us includes among its attributes “cognitive fluidity” (Mithen 1996), the ability to employ innovative
thoughts, a capacity for novel and sustained multilevel operations (Amati and Shallice 2007), abstract thought (Barnard
2010, in this issue), and the use of recursion and concepts of
past and future (Haidle 2010; Reuland 2010, both in this issue).
Executive functions of the brain, which depend on frontal
lobe–linked abilities, enable many of these attributes of complex
cognition, and additionally, executive functions facilitate goaldirected actions, anticipation of problems, analogical reasoning,
and planning over long distances or time (Coolidge and Wynn
2001, 2005; Wynn and Coolidge 2003). Examples of the type
of innovative technologies implied by executive functions include alloying metals and the production of kiln-fired ceramics
(Coolidge and Wynn 2006; Wynn and Coolidge 2007a, 2007b).
Both are based on the ability to bring together disparate raw
materials, often from distant separate sources, and to transform
them, sometimes irreversibly. Combinability, also found in recursive language (Reuland 2010), occurs in the transformation
of two or more metals into one.
Lyn Wadley is Honorary Professor at the Institute for Human Evolution and the School of Geography, Archaeology and Environmental
Studies, University of the Witwatersrand (PO Wits 2050, Johannesburg, South Africa [lyn.wadley@wits.ac.za]).

Innovative technologies requiring executive functions are
different from technologies that use technical expertise that
is normally acquired through apprenticeship (Wynn and
Coolidge 2007b). Wynn and Coolidge caution that if expertise
can produce a weapon such as a hafted spear (and it can),
archaeologists should conclude that this simpler skill, rather
than well-developed executive functions, was responsible.
How, then, can we recognize in the deep past the presence
of executive functions, abstract thought, thoughts about time,
and the ability of the mind to do many things simultaneously?
What behavioral proxies for these abilities would we need to
recognize in the archaeological record? Long-distance and
out-of-sight behavior involving response inhibition (such as
setting traps) would seem to be a convincing proxy for both
language and complex cognition. I shall try to convince you
that other proxies exist, too. In the course of this paper, I
shall analyze steps required to implement a technical strategy,
in this case composite-tool manufacture using compound adhesive. I shall argue that some of the steps may have been
impossible without recursion, abstraction, thoughts about
past and future, and the ability to multitask. First, I examine
some archaeological data.

ernizing cognition was almost certainly gradual. Some archaeologists argue that the process began at the dawn of the
Middle Stone Age (MSA) about 300,000 years ago. Ambrose
(2001) proposed that composite-tool making began then
(based on the appearance of backed tools at this time in
Zambia) and that this new behavior reflected an increase in
cognitive capacity. He hypothesized that composite-tool making requires planning and coordination of multiple, segregated
tasks and that these sophisticated behaviors evolved side by
side with frontal lobe development. Cognigrams that describe
the steps required for the production of a wooden spear, such
as those found in Germany at Schoeningen 500,000–400,000
years ago (Thieme 1997), are much simpler than those describing manufacture of composite weapons (Haidle 2010).
The methods involved in making a single-component spear,
such as simple stone tool knapping, could be taught to apprentices through demonstration—the “string-of-beads” approach. It could also be argued (as in Wynn and Coolidge
2007b) that expertise was sufficient for the construction of
composite tools even though these require an enormous outlay of labor for producing armatures and for hafting stone
inserts (Ambrose 2001; Torrence 2002). However, I believe
that this process is far more complex than previously has been
recognized. As a case study, I explore the evidence for composite weaponry in stone tool industries of the MSA of South
Africa—specifically at two sites: Rose Cottage Cave and Sibudu Cave—and I then describe my replications of composite
tools using compound glues.
Rose Cottage Cave, in the eastern Free State, has multiple
MSA layers with ages between about 26,000 and 100,000 years
ago (Jacobs et al. 2008a; Valladas et al. 2005; Wadley 1997).
Sibudu Cave, in KwaZulu-Natal, has multiple MSA layers
dating between 35,000 and about 80,000 years ago (Jacobs et
al. 2008a, 2008b; Wadley 2005a, 2006a; Wadley and Jacobs
2006). In a preliminary residue and use trace analysis of a
variety of MSA and Later Stone Age (LSA) stone tools from
Rose Cottage Cave, Williamson (1997) detected the presence
of red ochre and polish marks on the bases of many of the
tools where we expect that they would have been attached to
handles or shafts. This alerted us to the possibility that at
least some stone tools had been hafted to handles or spear
shafts using ochre as an ingredient of the adhesive. Here I
examine two classes of stone tools: points and segments.
Points
Points are sufficiently common in the MSA sequence that
they are often used as a defining feature of technocomplexes
that lasted from about 300,000 to 25,000 years ago (McBrearty
and Brooks 2000). It is widely accepted that stone points are
tips of spears in both the African MSA and the European and
Middle Eastern Middle Paleolithic (e.g., see Minichillo 2005;
Shea 2006; Villa, Delagnes, and Wadley 2005; Villa and Lenoir
2006). Spears can be thrusting weapons or throwing weapons

(Hughes 1998). Thrusting spears are handheld, while throwing spears are flight weapons (i.e., projectiles such as javelins).
Points have a variety of base shapes and thicknesses because
some were deliberately thinned to fit their shafts. All points
share the need to be hafted in a single direction, with the tip
at the distal end of the weapon where it can penetrate the
hide of prey. Use trace analyses of Sibudu points by Lombard
(2005, 2006a; Wadley, Williamson, and Lombard 2004) revealed clusters of minute fractures on the basal laterals of
points, which implies hafting. The damage was often accompanied by plant gum/resin and other plant residues, which
suggests that the hafts were wooden and that plant-based
adhesive was used, sometimes together with twine. A variety
of adhesive types may have been employed because ochre
stains were recurrently associated with the plant residues at
the bases of the points (Wadley, Williamson, and Lombard
2004; Williamson 2004). The variability among glues may
imply different functions for the spearheads; for example,
handheld thrusting spears need unyielding glue to allow repeated thrusts. In contrast, projected spears, such as javelins,
might have been designed so that the stone tip would break
within the body of the prey. This could be achieved by using
brittle glue that would shatter on impact. I shall discuss glue
types in more detail later. Animal product residues are concentrated on the distal ends of many of the points that Lombard (2005) analyzed, confirming that they were used as hunting weapons.
While stone-tipped spears are composite weapons because
they have minimally two components—shaft and stone tip—
they are not as complex as composite tools with barbs or tools
with inserts that can be hafted in different directions. I now
discuss a class of tools for which directionality is not
constrained.
Segments
Segments (sometimes called “crescents” or “lunates”) are defined as a portion of a circle with a curved, abruptly blunted
back and a straight, sharp chord (Deacon 1984). Each end of
a segment is pointed. The abrupt blunting (which is faceted
in a manner that archaeologists call backed retouch) on the
convex edge of segments probably assists their hafting by
creating an area of friction for the firm attachment of adhesives (Lombard 2007; Nuzhnyi 2000; Phillipson 1976).
Segments make only punctuated appearances in the MSA
and LSA. They have been found in the earliest Central African
MSA, with an age of about 300,000 years (Barham 2002), but
they are thereafter rare until much later. In southern Africa,
between about 70,000 and 55,000 years ago, segments and
other backed tools were the most common stone tools in an
MSA industry called the Howiesons Poort. Segments from
the MSA and the mid-Holocene LSA seem to have had multiple uses, including cutting (J. Deacon 1995; Wadley and
Binneman 1995), and the long cutting edges of some segments
make them ideal for use as knives. Large MSA segments may

sometimes have been used as barbs on spears or as spearheads
themselves, while their small LSA counterparts may have been
used as tips of arrowheads (H. J. Deacon 1995). McBrearty
and Brooks (2000) and Ambrose (2001) suggest that MSA
segments entail the presence of composite projectiles, although not necessarily the earliest forms of these weapons
(Brooks et al. 2006). Ethnographic collections and composite
weapons recovered from ancient sites show that segments and
even small blades or flakes were weapon components in the
past (Binneman 1994; Clark 1975; Clark, Phillips, and Staley
1974).
Residue analysis supports the suggestion that backed edges
were designed to facilitate hafting because plant gum/resin,
sometimes mixed with ochre or other substances, was found
on the backed edges of segments and other backed tools from
the Howiesons Poort industry at Rose Cottage (Gibson, Wadley, and Williamson 2004) and Sibudu (Delagnes et al. 2006;
Lombard 2006b, 2007, 2008; fig. 1). Segments, because of their
shape, with the straight cutting edge along the full length of
the tool, cannot be bound with twine (the cutting edge would
sever the twine), and the hafting of these stone inserts must
have depended entirely on robust adhesives.
Ochre-stained segments were also found in Kenya at Enkapune Ya Muto, dated to between 50,000 and 40,000 years
ago (Ambrose 1998). At Sibudu, in layers with ages somewhere between 70,000 and 61,000 years ago, Lombard (2006b,
2007, 2008) discovered that animal products were concentrated on the sharp, straight cutting edges of the segments,

S113

implying that these were the working ends of the tools. Use
trace analyses demonstrate that haft material was either bone
or wood; furthermore, carefully mapped positions of glue
residues show that segments could have been hafted in a
variety of positions (Lombard 2007, 2008). By rotating a segment so that its cutting edge faces different directions, it can
be hafted to form one of a variety of tools, weapons, or
weapon components such as barbs. It can be hafted vertically
into a lateral slot on a handle to form a knife blade. Several
such insertions can form a composite sicklelike knife.
Through rotation, segments can be hafted to form at least
four different types of hunting weapon: (1) transverse arrowheads (with the broad cutting edges placed horizontally), (2)
arrowheads or spearheads with pointed tips and asymmetrical
basal barbs (with the segments placed diagonally at about
60⬚), (3) split-point arrowheads or spearheads (by placing
two segments back-to-back), and (4) long, thin arrowheads
(by placing segments vertically; fig. 2).
Replicated segments used experimentally as projectile
weapons (on a carcass, not a live animal) by Pargeter (2007)
demonstrated that all four of these segment rotations create
satisfactory weapon tips. Transverse arrowheads were recovered in their entirety in ancient Egyptian sites (Clark 1975).
The elongated shape of a segment, with the sharp cutting edge
on its longest axis, suggests that it cannot be bound to its

shaft with twine; instead, the segment must rely on glue for
its attachment. Several adhesive recipes were used on segments
at Sibudu and other sites (Lombard 2007, 2008). Dolerite and
hornfels segments have high proportions of ochre stains on
their backed edges, suggesting that ochre was part of the plantgum adhesive, but fat has also been observed in the mixture.
In contrast, crystal-quartz-backed tools examined by Lombard seem to have been attached to their hafts using only
plant gum; few of these tools have ochre on their backing
(Delagnes et al. 2006:42). Of the quartz MSA segments from
Umhlatuzana, another KwaZulu-Natal MSA site, 68% have
plant resin adhesives but no ochre (Lombard 2007). The use
of simple gum glue without additives has advantages as well
as disadvantages; it is brittle and does not resist high-impact
pressure (Rots 2002:57–59) and therefore allows arrow barbs
or tips to become dislodged in animal carcasses, causing fatal
hemorrhages (Crombé et al. 2001:260). This effect is not desirable when handheld stabbing weapons are used; here the
spear’s stone insert needs to remain firmly in its haft so that
the hunter can, if necessary, make repeated thrusts at prey.
The results of a metric study of Sibudu segments (Wadley
and Mohapi 2008) support those from use trace analyses and
experimental “hunting”: there are at least three separate populations of segments based on their production from quartz,
hornfels, and dolerite. Attributes such as the length and
breadth of segments are markedly different between the rocktype populations: quartz segments are significantly shorter,
narrower, and thinner than hornfels segments, which are in
turn shorter, narrower, and thinner than dolerite segments.
The morphological study of Sibudu MSA segments (Wadley
and Mohapi 2008) shows that the toolmakers appreciated the
properties of rocks—their flaking, wear, and impact possibilities—and that they selected certain size ranges and size
ratios of segments for discrete weapons.
This evidence for variable use of segments shows that they
are not a single tool type other than in archaeological classification systems. The ancient artisans chose specific configurations of rocks, segment sizes, adhesives, and hafting strategies while holding in mind the desired end product. Then,
through differential rotation of the segments, they were able
to create an assortment of weapons and tools. Rots (2002)
claims that the flexible angle at which a tool can be placed
is the main advantage to hafting with adhesive. The rotation
of segments was therefore made possible through the production of effective glues that did not require additional support from twine bindings around the tool.
Historical records suggest that ochre was still recently used
as a loading agent for adhesives in Australia, where aborigines
combine vegetal fiber and ochreous dust and sand with their
resins (Rots 2002:60). Bushmen from Namaqualand, South
Africa, used “euphorbid milk and red clay” as “cement” for
attaching feathers to arrows, according to Doctor Atherstone,
who made the observation in 1854 (Webley 1994:61). The red
clay may have been ochre.
Prehistoric adhesive recipes probably varied according to

the needs of tools or weapons (Wadley 2005b, 2006b), and
robust compound adhesives may not always have been desirable, even for attaching segments to their hafts. Simple plant
gum creates a brittle adhesive that tends to shatter on impact.
As we have seen, this is not a disadvantage when stone inserts
are intended to break within the body of the prey, and some
nineteenth-century South African quartz arrowheads were intended to do precisely this (Clark 1975). Plant gum may also
have been preferred for attaching the tiny MSA quartz segments from Sibudu to their hafts if they were arrowheads.
Red ochre was not the only suitable loading agent for compound adhesives, and it was sometimes replaced with other
ingredients such as sand. Although MSA adhesives often have
ochre in them, LSA adhesives do not (Binneman 1983; Binneman and Deacon 1986; Deacon 1979; Deacon and Deacon
1980; Jerardino 2001; Mitchell 1995; Phillipson 1976; Schweitzer 1979). I now describe my replication studies with stone
tools, hafts, and adhesives in an attempt to explain the complexity of decision making that seems to have been associated
with the hafting of tools, particularly segments, in the MSA.
The descriptions are detailed so that the reader can evaluate
the cognitive requirements of the process.

Experimental Hafting of
Hunting Weapons
My experiments involved mounting stone tools on wooden
handles using natural adhesives, all of which had plant gum
from Acacia karroo as their base (Wadley 2005b; Wadley,
Hodgskiss, and Grant 2009). Simple adhesive comprised Acacia gum alone; compound adhesives combined Acacia gum
with powdered ochre and sometimes a small amount of
beeswax.
Collection of Ingredients
Replicated hafting of tools involves the collection of (1)
straight sticks of a wood type suitable for handles or shafts
(I used Grewia flava, from which Kalahari Bushmen make
bows and other wooden tools, and I selected straight branches
of similar thickness); (2) firewood suitable for a fire that will
burn with sustained medium heat; (3) rocks for making flakes;
(4) a hammer stone for knapping the flakes; (5) hematite
(Fe2O3) nodules for producing ochre powder; (6) coarsegrained flat rocks for grinding the ochre; (7) gum from A.
karroo trees; and (8) Hypoxis rigidula leaves for twine (although twine was used on only a few tools). The collecting
process from a variety of disparate sources was time consuming and involved considerable planning.
Initial Processing of Ingredients
The initial processing of the ingredients was as follows: (1)
Stone flakes were knapped, first for cutting the wooden shafts
and second for making suitable sharp inserts for the weapons.

Wadley Adhesive Manufacture and Complex Cognition

(2) Sticks were shaped to produce shafts. L-shaped platforms
worked best for securely holding my stone tools, although
other experiments used split shafts so that the stone could be
inserted into it. The L-shaped platforms were carefully whittled to maintain right angles, and the shaft laterals were
straightened and trimmed to remove nodules. The shafts were
cut from wet wood. These were dried for a week so that sap
would not moisten the adhesive and the shaft would not
shrink after the weapon’s creation. (3) Hematite nodules were
ground by rubbing them on coarse stone slabs to produce
powdered ochre. This is a lengthy process; about 10 mL of
powder is produced per hour of grinding. About 50 mL of
powder is needed for adhesive for 10 tools. Several coarse
slabs are needed for the task because the grinding process is
slower when the slab surface becomes smooth. Using a coarse
slab is essential because tiny, angular quartz particles
(80–1,000 mm) rub off the slab and become incorporated into
the fine ochre powder. This coarse aggregate provides a variety
of surface area sizes within the adhesive, and this is necessary
for successful bonding, just as a variety of particle sizes creates
successful concrete.
Once the ochre powder, shaped handles, and flakes were
ready, the fire was lit, and the composite tool production
started. I first describe the hafting of tools with Acacia gum.
Simple Adhesives Made from Plant Gum
Acacia gum is nature’s own adhesive, and its role is to seal a
tree’s wounds. In several replications, gum was used alone
(Wadley 2005b). Some of the gums were heated, and others
were allowed to dry naturally. The consistency of the gum is
variable; drier gums are easier to work with than runny ones,
which are very sticky. Gum that is fairly dry can be molded
around a tool and air-dried with no further processing. Wet
gum is difficult to control, and it needs to be dehydrated over
a fire to prevent it from dripping off the haft, which would
cause the stone tool to fall from its haft.
Gum dries slowly, even next to a fire, and the end product
is brittle, full of cracks and air bubbles, and sometimes crumbly. Like glass, gum adhesive tends to shatter on impact. Acacia gum is water soluble and hydroscopic; consequently, damp
conditions will cause this simple adhesive to become tacky,
allowing the stone tool to fall from its haft.
Compound Adhesives Made with Plant Gum,
Ochre, and Coarse Aggregate
These adhesives were mixed by adding powdered ochre to
Acacia gum (for detailed experimental results, see Wadley
2005b; Wadley, Hodgskiss, and Grant 2009). Sticky gum needs
more ochre than dry gum to make it workable. When the
mixture is workable, it can be easily molded to a tool. There
is no recipe that can be followed; making these glues is not
like baking a cake. The technique is not routine; it entails
evaluating the qualities of the ingredients and adjusting their

S115

quantities accordingly. It requires complete, undivided attention. A tiny piece of beeswax was added to a few of the
adhesives, and this creates satisfying plasticity in the compound. However, a dab too much of beeswax results in an
adhesive with “creep”; once dry, it shrinks and releases the
stone tool from the haft.
By adding an aggregate, the artisan cuts back on the time
that is required to dehydrate and harden the adhesive. Moderate heat from a fire dries and hardens the adhesive considerably faster than drying without heat. Air-dried adhesive
takes a long time to set—24 hours after manufacture, a stone
tool will dislodge from its haft immediately if it is used, revealing wet adhesive as a soft center inside the hardened outer
crust. My experiments showed that it takes as long as 6 days
for air-dried adhesive to dry and harden properly. However,
tools that were slowly dried near a fire for between 3 and 4
hours (rotating them about every 10 minutes) could be used
immediately without them breaking. The use of fire for dehydrating the ochre-loaded adhesive is an art, and the tools’
distance from the fire must be judged carefully. On one of
my first incompetent attempts at heating a newly hafted tool
over the fire, the adhesive swelled and the outer crust became
hard and charred, leaving an air-filled hollow under the crust.
This weakened the adhesive and the stone tool fell out. When
tools are heated too rapidly, the adhesive begins to boil, and
this also creates cracks and weakness. Vigilance, keen judgment, and an understanding of the feel and appearance of
the end product are required; failure can befall the tool at
any stage of its gestation if the artisan’s attention wavers.
Ochre-loaded adhesive is not water soluble or hydroscopic
after it has been properly dried. A combination of gum and
ochre provides an adhesive that cannot be reheated for recycling, and the components cannot be separated after they
have been mixed and dried. The process is irreversible.
One clue to the success of ochre as a loading agent may
be in nature: iron oxide minerals act as cementing agents in
some sedimentary rocks, such as banded ironstone or conglomerates; the iron oxide is chemically deposited from solutions containing the mineral. A change in pH is part of this
geological process, and after ochre is added to gum, a change
in pH also takes place (Wadley, Hodgskiss, and Grant 2009).
Pure synthetic hematite powder was never successful for adhesive manufacture because it lacks coarse grains. What makes
concrete set successfully in a modern engineering context is
the amalgamation of sand with fine and coarse stone aggregate
to bind the fine, powdery particles of cement when water is
added. Clearly, a similar combination of ingredients is required to create adhesive with ochre powder and gum. By
grinding ochre nodules directly on coarse sandstone slabs, as
I did (and similar ones have been found at Sibudu Cave), the
ancient glue makers would have automatically created a coarse
component in their glues. If this method was not used, sand
would need to be added to make up the necessary coarsegrained aggregate.

Current Anthropology Volume 51, Supplement 1, June 2010

Are Compound Adhesives Proxies
for Complex Cognition?
My adhesive replications and metric studies and the use trace
analyses conducted by Lombard (2006a, 2006b, 2007), Williamson (2004), and Gibson, Wadley, and Williamson (2004)
imply that artisans in the MSA had considerable technical
skill. However, Early Stone Age artisans also had enviable skill
(Wynn 1979, 1989), but this does not suggest that they had
complex cognition. The link between technological sophistication and cognitive complexity needs to be demonstrated,
not assumed. We need to show what types of mental architecture are indispensable for specific innovations.
Was it serendipitous that people 70,000 years ago got the
intricate process right when they were making compound
adhesives? I tend to think that it was not. Sticky Acacia gum,
nature’s own adhesive, can be used intuitively by people.
However, when this simple glue became inadequate, people
did not seek a more potent natural adhesive. Instead, they
“renovated” their existing plant-based glue in an innovative
and nonintuitive manner. In order to create compound glue
with plant gum as its base, they selected a product—ochre
powder—that has no gluelike attributes. Fat and wax also lack
attributes of natural adhesives, and these products were sometimes mixed with gum and ochre. It could not be predicted,
without considerable imagination, that the use of items with
nonadhesive properties could create successful glue. We can
express the transformation process, which involves a chemical
reaction: loose, dry powder ⫹ sticky, wet gum ⫹ heat p
hard, dry concreted adhesive. The whole is indeed greater
than the sum of its parts; the whole is a marriage of the most
desirable attributes of each separate ingredient. The concept
of transformation is important to the production of the irreversible adhesive, and I argue that the type of thought process required to make compound adhesives is not much different from that required for technologies such as alloying
metals and firing ceramics.
In some ways, the creation of compound glues mimics the
combinability that characterizes modern language (Reuland
2010). Embedded recursion—necessary for linguistic dependencies—requires that material stay internally represented before and after it is realized (ab, aabb, aaabbb, . . . anbn). It
enables the emergence of infinite combinability, but the system must hold in mind what it has previously done in order
to carry out what still has to be done. Haidle (2010) claims
that human manipulation of objects sometimes shows structural and cognitive parallels to language, including the use of
recursion and concepts of past and future. The parallel can
certainly be drawn with respect to the manufacture of compound adhesives, where there is constant feedback, reassessment, and correction of problems throughout all the stages
of action. The process also involves coordinating past and
future actions to ensure a successful end product. Thoughts
about time—past and future—are important in modern language, as is abstraction (the ability to recognize regularities

in diversity; Reuland 2010). Among its many roles, language
enables people to talk about behavioral variation, which can
be abstracted, enabling innovation from the circuit.
The artisans who made compound adhesives must have
understood and abstracted the individual attributes of ingredients such as plant gum and ochre, as well as the combined
properties of these inorganic and organic materials. Thus,
qualities such as wet, sticky, and viscous were mentally abstracted, and these meanings were counterpoised against the
properties of dry, loose, and dehydrating. The second set of
attributes opposes the first, but it is also remedial to it so
that, in combination, the attributes are complementary. I argue that this provides an example of fourth-order abstraction
as described by Barnard (2010), who makes the point that
simultaneous mental processing of two levels of meaning
would not have been possible before modern complex cognition. Fourth-order abstractions are schematic models of self,
others, and world, and their content can be compared with
generic feelings or intuition (Barnard 2010). Only the most
advanced mental architecture can control walking, talking,
and thinking at the same time, and this mental architecture
adds the ability to reorder elements of ideas and to evaluate
whether an idea is worth thinking about (Barnard 2010).
It is difficult to imagine how the expert glue maker could
train an apprentice to make compound adhesives without
explaining, in abstract terms, attributes and conditions such
as stickiness, viscosity, workability, consistence, plasticity, texture, particle size, temperature, concretization, water solubility, hydroscopic, dehydration, reversible process, irreversible process, shrinkage, homogeneity, creep, and shrinkage.
The concept of the irreversible transformation had to be explained using language as we understand it, for example, incorporating recursion, abstraction, and words to describe both
the past and the future.
Executive functions—such as projecting future action, anticipating problems, and preparing responses—are implicated
in the making of compound, heat-treated glues. The master
glue maker would have needed to hold in mind a template
for the end product because adhesive manufacture is not an
exact science and there is no set recipe for success. Quantities
of ingredients must be varied according to the condition of
each at the time of use. Viscosity of plant gum and the texture
and grain size of ochre powder must be gauged while the
adhesive is being mixed in order to get the right consistency.
The moisture content of gum varies from tree to tree and
season to season. Ochre nodules produce powder of different
grades depending on how and where the parent rock weathered. The ancient artisans also needed to understand the effects of varying temperature on their adhesives and, in turn,
the temperature potentials of dissimilar woods. The process
thus provides an example of Amati and Shallice’s (2007) nonroutine thought that aims for novel goals.
Thought experiments require holding a multiplicity of information in the mind at the same time. Not only did the
makers of the MSA composite tools hold in mind the vagaries

of compound-adhesive manufacture; they also simultaneously
had to think about the correct position for placing stone
inserts on the hafts. By about 70,000 years ago, artisans were
able to perform mental rotation of segments in order to create
implements of different shapes with different objectives. The
artisans needed to think abstractly about the qualities of their
segments in order to visualize their use after rotation. More
important, successful mental rotation seems to require advanced working-memory capacity and, in turn, complex cognition. The connection has been made by psychologists using
complex span tasks that are reliable and valid psychometric
tests for measuring working-memory capacity. The tasks are
able to predict performance in cognitive assignments such as
listening comprehension, language comprehension, following
oral and spatial directions, reasoning, and hypothesis generation (Engle 2010, in this issue). Among complex span tasks
used by psychologists are, for example, spatial ones requiring
a person to rotate a letter mentally or decide whether a figure
is symmetrical around a vertical axis (Engle 2010; Kane et al.
2004). Performance on such spatial tasks is linked to higherorder cognitive capabilities such as executive function and
complex reasoning (Kane et al. 2004).
In conclusion, I maintain that compound-adhesive manufacture in southern Africa 70,000 years ago (and possibly
earlier, but this has not yet been explored) required complex
cognition. As is the case in recursive language, the artisan
needed to hold in mind what was previously done in order
to carry out what was still needed. People were able simultaneously to talk, think, mix glue, maintain fire temperature,
and mentally rotate stone tools. As I have shown, some of
the steps in the making of compound adhesives and composite tools are not possible without abstraction, recursion,
and cognitive fluidity. Consequently, there seems to be a
strong case for attributing advanced mental abilities to people
who lived 70,000 years ago in Africa (and perhaps elsewhere
if similar processes are discovered out of Africa).
It is not yet possible to attribute complex cognition to
people who lived 300,000 years ago. In the Zambian site of
that age, Twin Rivers, quantities of coloring materials occurred
with backed tools, which Barham (2002) believes may be the
earliest of their kind and may be indicative of composite tools
(Ambrose 2001). It would be truly remarkable if these backed
tools were hafted with compound adhesives to form many
types of weapons, but there is, as yet, no evidence for this,
and the backed tools may have been handheld. D’Errico’s
(2008; d’Errico and Soressi 2002) work at Pech de l’Azé,
France, has demonstrated that there was systematic pigment
use by Neanderthals, so the use of pigment itself is not species
specific. Neanderthals also made use of pitch for attaching
their stone tools to hafts (Boëda et al. 1996). The ingenious
Neanderthal technology involved the use of controlled heat
because the resin portions of birch tar do not melt below
340⬚C and they burn above 400⬚C (Koller, Baumer, and Dietrich 2001). What seems to distinguish the compound adhesives discussed here from the birch tar used by Neanderthals

is the multitasking evident in the manufacture of the Acacia
gum and ochre compound glues. However, archaeological
data are added to almost daily, and we may yet be in for
surprises regarding the technological and cognitive abilities
of hominids before the period under review. I suggest, however, that if other compound glues are discovered archaeologically, they should be experimentally reproduced. It is only
through this kind of work that we can gain an understanding
of the mental processes involved in technology.
My case study from southern Africa suggests that archaeologists working with sites from different periods and in different parts of the globe may also find it useful to analyze
the mental processes implied by technologies evident at their
sites. Because few archaeologists have agreed on an appropriate definition of symbolic behavior in the deep past, the
type of method I offer here seems to provide a useful alternative for recognizing complex cognition.
