ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

This paper presents the results of a multidisciplinary study that combines archaeological and
palaeoenvironmental research to examine the relationship between environment and human
activities in Western Poland during the Late Glacial and Early Holocene. The study area lying
within the young moraine landscape produced several Late Palaeolithic and Early Mesolithic
sites, varied in terms of size and function. Analyses of pollen, plant macro-remains and
molluscs accompanied by geomorphological investigations and supported by series of
radiocarbon dates have enabled a detailed reconstruction of environment. It has shown that
despite climatic fluctuations during the Allerød and Younger Dryas, the studied area provided
favourable conditions for hunter-gatherer occupation. The presence of micro- and macroscopic
charcoal, charred particles of herbaceous plants and charred mosses in peat deposits of former
water bodies evidence various activities carried out by Federmesser and Swiderian groups, for
example setting up camp-fires and deliberate burning of the local marsh vegetation. Usewear
analyses of flint implements have revealed further traces of diversified human activities
undertaken at examined sites. Most importantly, this article focuses on plant-based craft
activities undertaken by hunter-gatherers, about which little has hitherto been known.

Introduction

Research area

The primary aim of this study was to reconstruct the
Late Glacial landscape in the area of Lubrza in western
Poland, in which the Late Palaeolithic Federmesser and,
later, the Swiderian groups lived and from the archaeological point of view, to trace the presence and possible activities of these groups. In both respects a
multidisciplinary study was carried out using a range
of disciplines to accompany the archaeological
research, including geomorphology, palynology,
archaeobotany, malacology, microwear analysis and
AMS 14C dating to provide an accurate chronology
for the sediments and for human presence in the
area. The occurrences of charred plant remains, including macroscopic and microscopic charcoal and charred
particles from herbaceous plants, in the core samples
from a former lake (basin No. 1 in Lubrza) allowed
a unique opportunity to reconstruct the episodes of
human presence. Moreover, this multidisciplinary
study offered many details about the biostratigraphy
of the area, the development of the landscape and the
development of vegetation through the end of the
Late Glacial and the early Holocene.

The research area lies in the Łagów Lake District, in the
Lubuskie District, western Poland (Figure 1). There are
diverse indicators of the last Scandinavian ice sheet (the
Vistulian Glaciation) in this region, with evidence of
recessional moraines (including push moraines,
accumulative moraines and dead ice moraines) of the
Leszno phase in the south and south-east and fluvioglacial landforms (including outwash plains, kames,
eskers and subglacial troughs) of the Poznań phase in
the north. The subglacial troughs – also known as subglacial channels – cut, sometimes deeply, through moraine and fluvioglacial plateaus (Figure 2(a)). Nowadays,
the troughs are filled with biogenic sediments, mainly
peat and gyttja. The research area is located in such a
channel, known as the Niesulice Channel, which is
18 km in length, from 200 to 400 m in width and 10
to 30 m in depth (Figure 2(a)).
The geomorphological and geological studies conducted around the Niesulice Channel indicated the
presence of four basins (or former lakes) of Late Glacial
age in the vicinity of Lubrza (marked as No. 1 through
No. 4). All are filled with gyttja and peat. The largest

on the mineral substrate of the basin or on basal
peat, which started to develop around initially small
and shallow water reservoirs above melting blocs of
dead ice. The basal peat is mainly composed of peat
moss (Sphagnum). Its thickness is highly varied and
ranges from 5 to 40 cm on average, while the maximum thickness, registered in the eastern part of the
basin, has been estimated at 80 cm. Based on the radiocarbon chronology, and accompanied by pollen analysis, the accumulation of the basal peat was dated to the
Allerød period.

basin (No. 1) was subjected to detailed palaeoenvironmental studies, primarily due to the high density of
archaeological sites in its vicinity. Basin No. 1 is
about 400 m in diameter and the maximum depth
has been estimated to more than 10 m. In the northern
part and in some areas of the southern part, the shores
developed in the form of steep slopes. Other parts of
the shores are shallower and are gently inclined. The
deepest spots in the basin are filled with 9.3 m thick
gyttja deposits. The gyttja is usually deposited directly

The archaeological sites
The study area is set within a young moraine landscape, which often buries traces of early archaeological
sites. On the sandy kames, just next to the basins, five
Late Palaeolithic sites were found within an area of ca.
1 km2 (Figure 2(b)). The largest, site 42, yielded over
10,000 flint artefacts related to two taxonomic units:
the Federmesser and Swiderian (Kabaciński and Sobkowiak-Tabaka 2010). The Federmesser cultural tradition
developed in northwestern Europe and across the territory of present-day Poland, generally in the Allerød
(ca. 13,350–12,680 BP)1 and in the initial phases of
the Younger Dryas2 (ca. 12,680–11,590 BP) (Litt et al.

2001; Lowe et al. 2008; Schild 2014). The Swiderian culture existed between the mid-Younger Dryas and the
beginning of the Preboreal (Sobkowiak-Tabaka 2011).
At site 42, the Federmesser remains are interpreted as
small hunting camps and a small workshop (Kabaciński, Sobkowiak-Tabaka, and Winiarska-Kabacińska
2014), while the features associated with the Swiderian
culture are most often classified as domestic units
(Kabaciński and Sobkowiak-Tabaka 2010). Additionally, 1000 Mesolithic artefacts, dated to the Early Holocene, were also found at site 42.
Remains of a small flint concentration of the Swiderian culture were also unearthed at site 11, located
approximately 400 m northeast of site 42 (Figure 2
(b)). A few artefacts also indicate the occupation of
the area by the Mesolithic groups (Kabaciński and Sobkowiak-Tabaka 2010). At site 8, on the other side of the
Niesulice Channel (Figure 2(b)), a backed piece was
found (Pyżewicz et al. 2008), which may be evidence
of a short-term stay of an individual group or hunters
frequenting this area on another occasion or is related
to the (camp) site of which traces were found at site 42.
Remains of two other Late Palaeolithic campsites
were discovered at site 10, on a sandy kame, ca.
500 m to the north of site 42. The first one is associated
with the Federmesser culture. In the northwestern part
of the large flint concentration (containing ca. 800
flints), remains of a hearth with 14 heavily burnt fine
mammal bones and several burnt flints were found.
A radiocarbon age of 11,300 ± 60 BP (Poz-65348)
was determined for the bone remains3 and are most
certainly associated with the presence of the Federmesser groups in the region during the mid/late Allerød.
In the central and western parts of the investigated
area, eight Swiderian flint concentrations were found.
Consisting of a different number of flint specimens
and occupying areas from 4 to 11 m², they amply illustrate the functioning of various activity zones of the
Swiderian groups. Their distribution is diffusive,
suggesting repeated settlement episodes (O’Connel
1987; Schild 1984). About 200 Swiderian artefacts
were also recovered from the northernmost site in
the investigated area, site 37. A few Mesolithic
implements were also found, attesting occupation of
the area in the Early Holocene.
Remains of a number of functionally diverse sites,
namely single finds, domestic units and workshops,
confirm that the area of the former lakes was repeatedly
frequented in the Late Glacial, but also during the Early
Holocene. Such a pattern has been also recognised in
the Jetzeel valley (Turner et al. 2013) and the Campine
region in Belgium (Vanmontfort et al. 2010). The
diverse geomorphology of the investigated area, i.e.
the vicinity of water bodies and the presence of moraine hills cut by outwash valleys and channels (Jasiewicz and Sobkowiak-Tabaka 2015) appears to have
been favoured by hunter-gatherers whose subsistence

125

economy was based around hunting, fishing and gathering. It is likely that the settlement intensity changed
throughout the studied area and time.

Material and methods
Two cores, L-33/2 and LB 2013, were taken from the former lake sediments of basin No. 1. Both cores are located
about 400 m apart from one another; core L-33/2 was
taken from the southern part of basin No. 1, near
archaeological site 42; while core LB 2013 was taken
from the northern edge, near site 10 (Figure 2(b)).
Both cores were subjected to pollen analysis; core LB
2013 was additionally subjected to plant macro-remains
and mollusc analyses. There were also radiocarbon
samples taken from both cores. Field sampling was
obtained using a 5 cm diameter Instorf corer.
Pollen
Sub-samples for pollen analysis of 1 cm3 volume were
taken in 1–3 cm intervals through the Late Glacial
sequence and in 5–15 cm intervals through the Holocene sequence. In the laboratory the samples underwent standard chemical treatment using the Erdtman
acetolysis method (Berglund and Ralska-Jasiewiczowa
1986; Faegri and Iversen 1978). Two tablets with Lycopodium clavatum were added to each sample to calculate pollen concentrations (Stockmarr 1971). 500 to
1000 palynomorphs were counted in each sample. Pollen analysis was carried out by I. OkuniewskaNowaczyk.
Pollen grains and non-pollen microfossils were
identified using Ergaval (640×) and Olympus (600×)
microscopes and several keys (Beug 2004; Faegri and
Iversen 1978; van Geel 1978) as well as by comparison
with a modern reference collection housed at Institute
of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Polish Academy
of Sciences. The percentages of all taxa were calculated
on the basic sum of tree, shrub and herb pollen, excluding pollen of limnophyta and telmatophyta as well as
spores of mosses and pteridophyta. The data are presented as simplified percentage and total pollen concentration diagrams (AP and NAP) (see Figure 3 for
L-33/2 and Figure 4 for LB 2013 results). The POLPAL
computer program was used to create the diagrams
(Nalepka and Walanus 2003). They were divided into
local pollen assemblage zones (LPAZ) in the sense of
Birks (1986) and Janczyk-Kopikowa (1987). The
LPAZ were determined on the basis of dominant or
characteristic taxa.
Plant macro-remains
After collecting the samples for pollen analysis, the
remaining material of core LB 2013 was cut into
1 cm-thick slides for macro-remains analysis. Mostly

each second 1 cm-slide was analysed. Ten macrofossil
samples were also used for the selection of plant
material for radiocarbon AMS dating. All macrofossil
samples were wet-sieved through a 0.25 mm mesh at
BIAX Consult laboratory. The macro-remains were
identified under a Leica binocular microscope at magnifications of 6× to 60×, and the charred epidermal tissue remains were examined under an Olympus
microscope (up to 600×); both categories of remains
were identified by L. Kubiak-Martens. The charcoal
remains were isolated from the macrofossil samples
and dried. Determination was carried out by
L. Kooistra (BIAX Consult) with the use of an incident
light microscope with dark field illumination and with
magnifications of up to 400×. The identifications were
based on wood anatomical criteria described by
Schweingruber (1982).
The results of plant macrofossil analyses are given as
number of remains per sample (see Appendix 1). In
this table, the plant taxa are arranged in ecological
groups: trees and shrubs, herbaceous plants and
aquatics. The last section in the table shows the occurrence of charcoal and other charred plant remains
through the LB 2013 sequence. The results of the charcoal analyses are given in Table 2.

Molluscs
After the plant macro-remain analyses were completed,
the sample residues from core LB 2013 were submitted
to malacological analysis. Mollusc shells were identified
under a Nikon SMZ 1500 stereoscopic microscope at
magnifications of 7.5×–112.5×. The analysis was conducted by A. Kurzawska using standard methods
described by Alexandrowicz (1987). The shell remains
were identified according to Piechocki (1979), Piechocki and Dyduch-Falniowska (1993), Kileen,
Aldridge, and Oliver (2004), Gittenberger et al.
(2004), Wiktor (2004) and the reference collection of
the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The ecological and palaeoenvironmental values of mollusc shells were described in
accordance with Ložek (1964), Alexandrowicz (1987),
Alexandrowicz and Alexandrowicz (2011). The malacological composition of described fauna is presented
in Appendices 2 and 3.

Usewear analysis
Microscopic observations were carried out with the use
of a Nikon Eclipse LV100 metallographic microscope

Results and discussion
Radiocarbon chronology
In order to obtain a chronostratigraphical framework
for our data, 12 AMS radiocarbon dates were determined for plant macro-remains recovered from core
LB 2013 at Poznan Radiocarbon Laboratory
(Table 1). The 14C dates were calibrated using the

online calibration program OxCal 2014 provided by
C. Bronk Ramsey.
Three radiocarbon dates were obtained from wood
charcoal recovered from the peat that was deposited
in the lower part of sequence LB 2013 between 705
and 709 cm; two dates (11,770 ± 80 BP and 11,760 ±
60 BP) were obtained from pine (Pinus) charcoal and
one (11,700 ± 60 BP) from willow (Salix) charcoal.
All three dates correlate well with the early Allerød
and possibly demonstrate the presence of the Late
Palaeolithic Federmesser groups in the area already
during this period.
There is an obvious disturbance in the stratigraphy
of the bottom part of the LB 2013 sequence between

128

709 and 711 cm; this is demonstrated by the results of
the AMS analyses. Two fragments of pine wood charcoal and one fragment of waterlogged pine twig recovered from a thin bed of coarse clayey sand in the
bottom of the LB 2013 (710–711 cm) sequence (thus
under the peat deposits) were dated and gave a radiocarbon age of 11,250 ± 50 BP, which correlates with
the mid/late Allerød. This date is clearly some 500
years younger than the series of dates from the peat
deposit lying above the sand bed: i.e. 11,700 ± 60 BP
(Poz-58465), 11,760 ± 60 BP (Poz-58463), 11,770 ± 80
BP (Poz-65347). At this point, there is no clear explanation for this vertical displacement. Perhaps one of
the possible causes could have been the nature of the
sedimentation processes in the basin. What is important to note about the date of 11,250 ± 50 BP, however,
is that it corresponds well with the AMS date of 11,300
± 60 BP obtained from burnt animal bone remains
recovered from archaeological site 10 in Lubrza. Both
dates would have been associated with the presence
of the Federmesser groups at the site during the mid/
late Allerød.
According to radiocarbon chronology, the peat formation at the location of the LB 2013 core was completed by the second half of the Allerød, as suggested
by the radiocarbon age of 11,340 ± 60 BP derived
from the waterlogged pine needles recovered from
the top of the peat (703–704 cm). Two dates, 11,220
± 60 BP and 11,160 ± 60 BP (both obtained on moss
remains), recovered from the top of the gyttja sediments of the LB 2013 core (691–692 and 687–
688 cm, respectively), are both associated with the
final part of the Allerød.
According to yet another two AMS dates from the
gyttja deposits (Chara lime), 10,400 ± 50 BP (651–
652 cm) and 10,660 ± 50 BP (676–677 cm), much of
this sediment sequence covers the following Younger
Dryas. Both dates were obtained from waterlogged terrestrial plant macro-remains. Finally, on the basis of
the AMS analysis, the top of the LB 2013 sequence
(602–606 cm) is dated to 8790 ± 50 BP, and is thus
associated with the transition from the late Preboreal
to the Boreal. According to pollen analysis there is a
stratigraphical hiatus which falls into the Preboreal.4
As for core L-33/2 from Lubrza, the radiocarbon
measurements provided three dates: 12,000 ± 60 BP
(associated with the pre- Allerød/early Allerød),
11,470 ± 60 BP (correlated with the Allerød), and
10,780 ± 60 BP (correlated with the early Younger
Dryas) (see Figure 3, pollen diagram).
Reconstruction of vegetation and history of the
water reservoir in Lubrza – results of pollen,
plant macro-remains and molluscs analyses
In the southern part of the studied area, the history of
basin No. 1 commences before the Allerød. As

indicated by the pollen spectra from the lowermost
part of core L-32/2 (Figure 3) dated to ca. 12,000 ± 60
BP, the pre-Allerød accumulation of organic sediments
began with the mosses that would have occupied the
marshy ground and with members of the sedge family
(Cyperaceae), horsetail (Equisetum) and bogbean
(Menyanthes trifoliata). With the appearance of
dwarf birch (Betula nana t.) and polar willow (Salix
polaris t.), shrub tundra was formed. The sandy areas
were occupied by juniper (Juniperus communis). The
area must have also provided favourable conditions,
especially in the first stage, for growth of heliophytes
such as mugwort (Artemisia), rockrose (Helianthemum), and clubmoss (Selaginella selaginoides).
Towards the beginning of the Allerød, the percentages of pollen of juniper and willows decreased,
while the proportion of sea buckthorn (Hippophäe
rhamnoides) increased. Similar percentages of the pollen of tree-birch (Betula) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) are observed from that time (Figure 3).
The climate became warmer in the Allerød, which
resulted in the emergence of forest, as clearly indicated
by pollen spectra from both cores L-32/2 and LB 2013
(Figure 4). At first there were sparse birch and pine forests with gaps occupied by heather (Calluna) and Artemisia, and then denser birch and pine forests. Variable,
sometimes significant amounts of birch pollen may
result from the colonisation of birch on to the bogs. Artemisia found conditions favourable for spreading and
peat moss (Sphagnum) expanded thereafter. These
changes were more intensively pronounced in the
southern part of the basin. Here, hollows filled with
water were formed and offered places for algae of the
genera Pediastrum and Tetraedron to grow in the northern part of the reservoir. Large areas would have been
covered with sedges (Carex) throughout the Allerød,
with varied occurrences of Equisetum and Menyanthes
trifoliata. The presence of pollen grains of thermophilic
trees, such as Alnus, Quercus and Ulmus is interpreted as
possible contamination and therefore is excluded from
further interpretation of the pollen spectra.
The results of the plant macro-remains analysis
from core LB 2013 (Appendix 1), add some details to
the reconstruction of the local vegetation around
water reservoir No. 1 at Lubrza. They also help to illustrate the landscape which surrounded the archaeological sites.
The remains of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), including fragments of needles, cone scales and bud scales,
indicate that pine trees were present in the area
through the Allerød, and possibly into the Younger
Dryas. No macro-remains of tree-birch were found in
the peat deposit through the first half of the Allerød
(ca. 11,700 BP). Even though absent in the waterlogged
remains, the presence of Salix charcoal identified in
two peat samples (between 707 and 709 cm in core
LB 2013) suggests that willows (although unclear

in the Allerød.

whether shrub or tree willows) were also growing in the
area, possibly close to the water pool.
Through the second half of the Allerød, there is a
clear increase in the numbers of plant remains and in
the diversity of species. The plant remains were deposited in calcareous gyttja. Even though sporadic, the
presence of oogonia of green algae (Chara), and the
sacs of Piscicola geometra (fish parasite), suggest that
there must have been permanent bodies of open water.
The tree-birch (Betula pubescens/tortuosa) must
have now grown close to the water reservoir, as indicated by the fruits and catkin scales represented in
the macro-remains record. This agrees well with the
results of pollen analysis, which indicates the increase
of birch towards the end of the Allerød, while the
role of pine decreased (particularly noticeable in the
southern part of the basin). There must also have
been areas or patches of the dwarf birch (Betula
nana) nearby, as suggested by the fruits, catkin scales
and leaves of this shrub found in plant macrofossils
(however, only towards the end of the Allerød). The
presence of dwarf birch, which is characteristic for arctic and boreal forest vegetation, has also been recorded
in Allerød deposits in Germany and in Denmark
(Früchtl 1998; after Bittmann 2007; Mortensen, Henriksen, and Bennike 2014). This would indicate that
there were openings in the late Allerød forest, for
many herbs to colonise.
Large numbers of vegetative remains of peat moss
(Sphagnum) and other mosses (including Calliergonella, cf. Warnstorfia, cf. Calliergon and Tomenthypnum niten) found in the gyttja samples associated
with the second half of the Allerød suggest that there

were places (or patches) of bog vegetation near the
water basin where the peat continued to accumulate.
The bog was dominated by mosses but would also
have supported herbaceous plants including sedges
(Carex rostrata, Carex vesicaria, Carex cf. limosa and
Carex paniculata), bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata)
and marsh willow herb (Epilobium palustre). The
plant spectrum, particularly the combination of mosses
with the (possibly dense) growth of sedges together
with the conspicuous presence of bogbean, suggests
that transitional bog would have been formed (see
Figure 5).
In addition to pollen and plant macro-remains, the
presence of mollusc species in samples along the analysed LB 2013 sequence also made it possible to trace
changes in local environment and the conditions of
deposition of the sediments. As a result of mollusc
analysis, three molluscan phases were distinguished
(Appendices 2 and 3).
The first mollusc assemblage (phase I in core LB
2013, 711–691 cm) coincides with the accumulation
of peat during the Allerød. Due to peat accumulation,
mollusc shells occur only as single fragments at a
depth from 702 to 711 cm. Remains of shells start to
appear regularly along with the change of the sediment.
In gyttja (from a depth of 702 cm), mollusc fauna is
represented by Valvata piscinalis, Valvata cristata,
one species of the family Lymnaeidae and Pisidium
nitidum. These suggest that a shallow, yet permanent,
water body could already have existed in the area in
the second part of the Allerød. Toward the first half
of the Allerød this small basin could have been periodically overgrown, which is indicated by the lack of

130

mollusc shell finds (except for single fragments per
sample) in depths between 690 and 693 cm.
The cooling of the Younger Dryas caused changes in
the landscape, including a reduction in forest cover and
the spread of juniper, as well as growth of both Artemisia patches and areas dominated by grasses. At that
time, development of the Pediastrum and Tetraedron
algae can be observed. The pollen diagram for this
period is characterised initially by a higher proportion
of Artemisia, with no or infrequent occurrences of
Juniperus communis. Over time, juniper appears to
have expanded, only to decrease towards the end of
the Younger Dryas. Artemisia is constantly present.
From the beginning of this period, the higher proportion of juniper in the section from the northern
part of the reservoir may be associated with the favourable conditions for its growth at the kame nearby
(Figure 4).
The clear decrease in plant macro-remains in
samples between 637 and ca. 680 cm from core LB
2013, corresponds well with the cooling of the climate
during the Younger Dryas as indicated by the pollen
spectra. Even though the number of remains of pine
and tree-birch declined in this zone, both trees were
still present in the area. Remains of dwarf birch (Betula
nana) suggest that this shrub constituted part of the
local vegetation. There is a clear decrease in Sphagnum
remains until their disappearance towards the end of
the Younger Dryas. Leaf mosses (Bryales) are less
numerous than in the previous period but occur regularly through the whole zone, suggesting that fen rather
than bog is now developed. Some sedges (including
Carex aquatilis, Carex vesicaria, Carex rostrata, Carex
paniculata/diandra) and clubmoss (Selaginella selaginoides) would have accompanied the leaf mosses.
As demonstrated by single finds of buds, willow
(Salix sp.) and alder (Alnus sp.) were also present in
the area (both were found in sample 681–682 cm).
The bud remains of alder most likely belong to green
alder (Alnus viridis), which is a sub-alpine shrub or
small tree which would have grown in Lubrza together
with willow. Unfortunately, the pollen grain from the
same sediment sequence could have been identified
only to the genus level (Alnus).
What is important to notice is a significant change
in the lithology of the sediments in the former water
basin. At the depth of about 680 cm there is a clear
transition from calcareous gyttja to Chara lime,
which obviously marked the boundary between the
end of the Allerød and the start of the Younger
Dryas. Characteristic for the Younger Dryas is the
deposition of a ca. 40 cm thick layer of Chara lime.
This sediment is almost completely composed of the
remains of calcium carbonate-rich incrustations of
green algae (see Tobolski 2000). At Lubrza, this episode
may possibly represent open water with underwater
‘meadows’ of green algae thriving on the bottom of

the water reservoir. The presence of broad-leaved
pondweed (Potamogeton natans) suggests a water
depth of up to 1 m. The water conditions must also
have been favourable for various small aquatic animals,
as suggested by high numbers of water insects (Chironomidae), water mites (Acari), moss animals (Bryozoa,
aquatic invertebrates) and fresh-water sponges (Spongiae). The presence of sclerotia of the terrestrial fungus
Cenoccocum geophilum (between 649 and 652 cm)
may indicate soil erosion from the water shore.
The rich fauna of mollusc species, such as Valvata
piscinalis, Lymnaea stagnalis, Radix ovata, Bathyomphalus contortus, Gyraulus crista, Gyraulus laevis, Pisidium hensowanum, Pisidium hibernicum and
Sphaerium corneum, in the studied LB 2013 section
between 628 and 691 cm (defined as Phase II), and
chronologically associated with the second half of the
Allerød and through the Younger Dryas, is also indicative of the permanent water body in Lubrza. The presence of Pisidium nitidum and Pisidium subtruncatum
may indicate a place in the basin where the water
remained in motion (marginal zone). Two species, Pisidium obtusale lapponicum and Gyraulus laevis, are
known as cold-tolerant species. Their appearance
already at the end of the Allerød suggests cooling of
the climate in this period – an indication of the following Younger Dryas. The second group of molluscs that
characterises this phase is associated with aquatic vegetation, inhabiting small, strongly overgrown reservoirs, such as: Valvata cristata, Stagnicola palustris,
s.l., Pisidium milium, P. pulchellum, P. obtusale lapponicum. The three Pisidium species frequently occur in
shallow reservoirs with swampy conditions or in a shallow and marshy littoral of a lake.
At the end of phase II (628–637 cm) there is a
decline in the number of species as well as specimens,
which might be considered as a sign of change that
came with the following Holocene epoch. The top of
the LB 2013 sequence is clearly of early Holocene
age. The AMS radiocarbon analysis obtained from
the un-charred remains of pine and tree-birch from
the uppermost section (depth 602–606 cm) gave an
age of 8790 ± 50 BP and can be associated with the
transition from the late Preboreal to the early Boreal.

Evidence for Late Palaeolithic huntergatherer activities in Lubrza
The occurrences of wood charcoal through the Allerød
peat deposit in core LB 2013 (between 705 and
709 cm), received much of our attention. Pine
(Pinus) and willow (Salix) charcoal were identified; in
some samples up to ca. one dozen fragments were
found (Table 2). Even though more fragments of charcoal were recovered, particularly in samples 705–706,
706–707 and 707–708 cm (in total, an additional 25–
30 fragments in each sample), their small sizes

ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY

prevented identification of the wood taxon. What was
interesting to note about some of the fragments of
pine wood charcoal was that they showed resinous
solid matter attached to wood vessel elements. This
would suggest that this charcoal originated from
(camp) fires which were burning with limited (or controlled?) input of oxygen (see Kubiak-Martens, Langer,
and Kooistra 2013). In addition, there were charred
moss remains found in some samples dated to the
Allerød (but also later, in samples dated to the Younger
Dryas). This possibly indicates the use of mosses for
fuel and/or fire starter. Ethnographic records show
that dry moss is often used as a fire starter by various
indigenous people in the northern part of North America (Kari 1995).
Interestingly, a remarkably high number of charred
plant particles was found in pollen samples dated to the
Allerød. These were mostly leaf and/or stem epidermal
fragments of grasses (most likely including Phragmites)
(Figure 6(a,b)), but also microscopic charcoal dust. It is
probable that a combination of anthropogenic and
natural fires is responsible for the late glacial charcoal
records (cf. Edwards, Whittington, and Tipping
2000). In Lubrza, however, all the occurrences of
macroscopic and microscopic charcoal, charred particles of herbaceous plants and charred mosses are
suggested to be from various activities of the Federmesser groups who used the area through much of the
Allerød. Late Palaeolithic activities, such as setting up
the camp-fires or the burning of local (marsh) vegetation, are of our prime candidates as the ways of
entry for all these charred plant remains in Lubrza
record.
With regards to the Younger Dryas, there is also
some macroscopic charcoal, charred stem fragments
of mosses and charred fruits of sedges (Carex rostrata/vesicaria) found in macro-remain samples from
throughout this period (Appendix 1). Many of the pollen spectra also displayed the presence of charcoal dust
(abundant in some samples) and charred microscopic
particles of herbaceous plants, including epidermis of
sedges (Cyperaceae) (Figure 6(c)). Although natural

131

fires cannot be completely ruled out, the episodes of
activities associated with the presence of Swiderian
groups in the area, such as setting up camp-fires or
burning of the marsh vegetation, are more likely to
be responsible for the occurrence of these charred
plant remains.
Evidence for the burning of local marsh vegetation
was presented earlier from other hunter-gatherer sites
across temperate Europe. One of the best documented
examples of intentional and recurrent burning of reed
beds comes from the Early Mesolithic site at Star Carr
in England (Hather 1988; Law 1988). Burning of marsh
vegetation was also suggested for the Early and Middle
Mesolithic river dune site at Rotterdam-Yangtze Harbour in the Netherlands, where charred seeds of
marsh plants were found in macro-remain samples
taken throughout the sequence of organic deposits correlated with the Mesolithic use of the site. These were
accompanied by charred particles of herbaceous plants,
mainly reed epidermis in pollen spectra from the same
samples (Kubiak-Martens, Kooistra, and Verbruggen
2015). It seems that the burning of local marsh vegetation would also have been practiced at Całowanie,
a Late Palaeolithic and Early Mesolithic site on an
island in the ancient Vistula channel in Poland,
where charred remains of marsh plants, including
sedges and bogbean, were found in the archaeological
macro-remain assemblages (Kubiak-Martens and
Tobolski 2014).
There might be a few reasons why all these huntergatherer groups, at different sites and through an
extended time span, deliberately set fire to the marshes.
To improve hunting conditions would possibly be one
of them. An alternative – and possibly the main reason
for this practice, however, would have been to create
easier access to open water and perhaps to maintain
it (Barnett 2009; Kubiak-Martens, Kooistra, and Verbruggen 2015 for further discussion).
From the archaeological evidence it appears that
people were engaged in various activities at the Federmesser campsite(s) in Lubrza site 10. The Federmesser
flint concentrations were found to be functionally

differentiated into, i.e. the areas of processing of game
and hide, the slicing of soft materials such as hide,
plants, and probably fish, and wood processing and
working with other hard materials, including raw
flint. The very small number of points (only four specimens) suggests a different character of the campsite
than that of the hunting campsite at Lubrza site 42.
The most likely functions of the Federmesser campsite(s) was the processing of raw material (Baltic erratic
flint and quartzite) and game.
Some significant differences have been noted
between the general impressions of the activities undertaken by the Swiderian and the Federmesser groups.
Particularly noteworthy are areas of intensive plant
processing and areas of processing medium-hard and
hard materials, i.e. bone/antler, attributable to the Swiderian culture, which are evidenced by the distribution
of flint tools with usewear traces.
Furthermore, various activities of both Federmesser
and Swiderian groups in the studied area are well documented by usewear traces left on flint assemblages. The

usewear analyses, which aimed to define the function of
the flint artefacts from Lubrza site 10, showed a relatively large number of tools for processing wood and
non-woody (herbaceous) plants (Sobkowiak-Tabaka
and Kufel-Diakowska, in preparation). Twenty one
tools with “plant-like” working polish, which is produced on the edge of a flint blade as a result of working
plant material come from the concentrations of stone
artefacts related to the Federmesser and Swiderian cultures. This group of tools includes three implements
with wood polish, 12 implements with wood or high
silica content plant polish (Figures 7–9) and five pieces
with polish from processing plant fibres (Figure 10).
With the exception of one tool, the distribution of
microtraces on the edges of blades, burin and flakes,
indicates perpendicular motion. Tools were used for
activities such as scraping, whittling and splitting,
they were associated with craft production, including
the acquisition of plant material (such as extracting
plants fibres from stems) and were used for making
impossible to specify products, most probably cordage

or matting. According to plant macrofossil analysis, in
the area of the archaeological site in Lubrza, especially
around water reservoirs, a variety of trees and herbaceous plants were available that could be used as raw
materials for crafts. In general, flint tools for processing
vegetal material are poorly recognised in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic assemblages, probably due to
the scarcity of usewear analyses as well as the seasonality of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites (Guéret et al.
2014; Jacquier 2014). In this context three aspects of
usewear on tools from Lubrza are particularly interesting and important. Firstly, the number of tools with
‘plant-like’ polish is relatively high. Secondly in many
cases the traces of use preserved on the flint tools
take on a hybrid form, analogous to the usewear previously identified with the Neolithic and the production of plant fibres. Next, the traces are varied
and therefore difficult to interpret, despite many
years of experimentation devoted to plant processing
tools (e.g. Caspar, Féray, and Martial 2005; Juel Jensen
1994; van Gijn 2010). These observations indicate that
the working of plant material in the Late Palaeolithic

was a complex process and that skilled Palaeolithic
craftsmen were able to make more things than wooden
hafts and simple construction elements.

Conclusions
The history of vegetation of the Lubrza area has its
beginning in the pre-Allerød period. In the initial
phase, there were mosses, sedges and other herbaceous
plants which would have grown on wet places. Shrub
tundra, with dwarf birch and polar willow, was also
formed on wet places, and juniper patches would
have occupied sandy areas. During the Allerød, the climate became warmer. This resulted in the growth of
forest consisting of varying quantities of birch and
pine.
There would have also been patches of the dwarf
birch, suggesting open areas in the forest. Peat formation with peat moss (Sphagnum) and various leaf
mosses started during the early Allerød and was completed sometime during the second half of the Allerød.
The cooling of the Younger Dryas caused changes in

134

the landscape, including the reduction of the forest
cover and the spread of juniper and Artemisia patches,
which were accompanied by sedges and other herbaceous plants. Dwarf birch constituted part of the local
vegetation. The shrub willows, possibly accompanied
by green alder, would have occupied the moist soils
along the water margins. A few scattered remains of
pine and tree-birch suggest that stands (or patches)
of both trees would still have thrived in the area during
the Younger Dryas.
The water reservoir (or small lake) in Lubrza was
formed sometime during the (late) Allerød, it flourished during the Younger Dryas and was transformed
into peat bog in the Early Holocene.
The Allerød forest with its pine and tree-birch
stands would most likely have provided many of the
animal and plant resources to the Late Palaeolithic
hunter-gatherer groups associated with the Federmesser cultural tradition who visited the area through
much of the Allerød. The open-forested areas and
drinking-water spots would have been very suitable
as foraging places for large herbivores such as elk and
red deer. The local vegetation would also have provided
a variety of plant resources for the people: wood for
fuel, raw material for construction, tools and craft,
and a diversity of plant foods (Bishop, Church, and
Rowley-Conwy 2015).
The water basin, which clearly deepened towards
the end of Allerød, would have provided drinking
water for people and animals. The charcoal remains
of pine and willow suggest that the groups of Federmesser people used various ecological zones to collect wood
for fuel, and possibly for other activities. The occurrences of charred particles of marsh plants in the pollen
spectra suggest that these activities might have involved
burning of local marsh vegetation.
The charred plant remains found in both pollen and
macro-remains assemblages dated to the Younger
Dryas provided possible evidence for the presence of
the hunter-gatherer groups associated with the Swiderian culture and for their various activities. The presence
of charred particles of sedge epidermis and charred
seed remains of sedges suggests that setting local
marsh vegetation or sedge fen on fire would have
been one of these activities.
Interestingly, various activities of both Federmesser
and Swiderian groups in the area are also well documented by usewear traces left on flint assemblages.
These suggest that a large number of tools would
have been used for processing wood and herbaceous
plants, and possibly plant fibres.

3. A dated bone fragment yielded 1·63 mg carbon from
2100 mg (after preparation 609·7 mg). Theoretically,
the carbon content in sample Poz-65348 enables
reliable results (Wohlfarth et al. 1998), yet the AMS
date Poz-65348 on burnt bones is considered to be
the latest possible (minimal).
4. One AMS date was acquired from waterlogged seeds
of terrestrial plants from depth 709–711 cm, and
gave an age of 7970±40 BP (early Atlantic). The
young age of this measurement is most likely due to
the shifting of younger material during the field coring
(Tomasz Goslar, personal communication), and at
this point the date is rejected.
