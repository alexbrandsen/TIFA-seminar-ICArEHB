Many Pleistocene caves and rock shelters contain evidence of carnivore and human activities. For this
reason, it is common to recover at these sites faunal remains left by both biological agents. In order to
explain the role that carnivores play at the archaeological sites it is necessary to analyse several elements,
such as the taxonomical and skeletal representation, the age proﬁles, the ratio of NISP to MNI, the
anthropogenic processing marks on the carcasses (location and purpose of cutmarks and burning and bone
breakage patterns), carnivore damage (digested bones, location and frequencies of toothmarks and bone
breakage), length of the long bones, frequencies of coprolites and vertical distribution of the faunal
remains, inter alia. From this, the documentation of carnivores in a faunal assemblage with a clear
anthropogenic component can be understood from three main phenomena: (1) the carnivores as accumulators and the use of the site as a den; (2) carnivores as scavengers of hominid refuse and; (3) carnivores
as hominids’ prey. Of these three phenomena, the last one is the least documented at the Middle Pleistocene sites. From this perspective, here we present the case of the anthropogenic use of a lion (Panthera
leo fossilis) from level TD10-1 of Gran Dolina (MIS 9, Sierra de Atapuerca, Burgos, Spain). The lion bone
remains show signs of direct interaction between this big cat and human groups that occupied Gran Dolina
in these chronologies. From this perspective, the aim of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge of the
role developed by large carnivores in the anthropogenic contexts and to provide data on human use of
these predators at the European Middle Pleistocene sites.

1. Introduction
The archaeological excavations carried out at the Middle Pleistocene sites show the occupation of karstic areas by hominids and
carnivores. For this reason, the recovery of faunal remains left by both
biological entities is common at these sites (both the bones left
behind from their activities and/or their own skeletal remains). Many
carnivores regularly use caves as a breeding place or as a refuge. There
are several studies that allow us to recognise both current and
archaeological dens (Sutcliffe, 1970; Haynes, 1980, 1983a; Hill, 1984;
Blumenschine, 1985, 1986a, 1988a, 1988b; Clot, 1987; Cruz-Uribe,
1991; Domínguez-Rodrigo, 1994, 2001; Selvaggio, 1994; Fosse,

alia). However, we must bear in mind that not all carnivores behave in
a similar way or have the same impact on the carcasses. Each species
has its own ethology and physical characteristics, which inﬂuence the
accumulations that they produce and the intensity with which they
act on bone remains. Even so, a series of general characteristics are
identiﬁed in all assemblage generated by non-human predators. In
general, the age proﬁles of the prey tend to be attritional (with a
predominance of young and senile individuals over adults). The
skeletal representation of the prey is highly variable with a dominance of limb bones (except for carpal and tarsal bones which can be
swallowed during the consumption process) and some elements of
the axial and cranial skeleton (Binford, 1981). The proportion
between the cranialepostcranial skeleton of the prey decreases
according to the accumulating carnivore and to the size of the
ungulates, so the larger the prey, the lower the capacity of the
carnivore to transport the skull (Cruz-Uribe, 1991). Furthermore,
coprolites, skeletal remains belonging to other carnivores, deciduous

teeth (in the case of hyena maternity dens) and digested bones are
often retrieved at these assemblages (Cruz-Uribe, 1991; Villa et al.,
2004; inter alia). Some authors, such as Fosse (1994) or Villa et al.
(2004), also observed differences related to the bone fragmentation
between the carnivore sites and anthropogenic sites. According to
these authors, the bones recovered in the assemblages generated by
carnivores usually are less fragmented and, therefore, the proportions of identiﬁable elements are much higher.
However, the carnivores are not only accumulators. The smells
from the remains left in the human camps are attractive for many
predators and, therefore, it is common for these carnivores to act as
scavengers in search of potentially consumable elements (Binford,
1981). Different observations and experimental reproductions
have been made with wild and captive animals, attempting to
document the carnivore damage on the faunal assemblages generated by human groups (Sutcliffe, 1970; Klein, 1975; Bunn, 1986;
Bunn et al., 1980; Bunn et al., 1988; Blumenschine, 1986a, 1986b;
Marean et al., 1992). All of these studies coincide with the fact that
scavengers have a predilection for epiphyses of limb bones and for

elements of the axial skeleton. The modiﬁcations on these
anatomical portions are so intense that in many cases they make
them disappear. On the contrary, the diaphyses, which are generally
highly fractured during the processing and anthropic consumption,
show very little impact. This duality is due to the fact that bones
with a high content of spongy tissue (epiphyses and ﬂat bones)
contain resources (fat), which are difﬁcult to reach for the hominids
without the appropriate technology, such as boiling (Oliver, 1993).
However, during this process, carnivores do not only destroy the
bones, but they can also affect the original position of the remains,
by carrying out important remobilisations and signiﬁcantly altering
the spatial distribution left by human groups (Binford et al., 1988).
Nevertheless, the presence of carnivores and their damage in
the anthropogenic context, do not only respond to the scavenging
activities or to the use of the site as den. Carnivores can also be
a potential prey for human groups because they can offer a series of
usable resources (skin, tendons, meat, marrow, etc.). As with
the herbivores, the processing of the carnivores is identiﬁed by the
presence of cutmarks, the intentional bone breakage and/or the

burning patterns of their remains. Although archaeological examples exist in some assemblages of the ﬁrst half of the Upper Pleistocene (Auguste, 1991, 1995; Stiner, 1994; Arribas et al., 1997; David,
1997; Tillet, 2002), the use of these animals is not common at the
Middle Pleistocene sites, especially in the case of large carnivores.
From this perspective, we present here the case of the anthropogenic utilization of a lion from level TD10-1 of Gran Dolina (Sierra
de Atapuerca, Burgos, Spain). The bone remains belonging to Panthera leo fossilis show signs of direct interaction between human
groups and big cats from these chronologies. From this perspective,
the aim of this paper is to provide data on human use of these
predators in the European Middle Pleistocene.
2. Methodology
Level TD10-1 faunal analysis of the Gran Dolina site was carried
out following standard archaeozoological methods (Lyman, 1994;
Reitz and Wing, 1999) and includes all fossil material from 2000 to
2001 excavations. Anatomical, taxonomic and modiﬁcation details
were recorded. To assess completeness of the sample, NISP (Number
of Identiﬁed Specimens), MNE (Minimum Number of Elements), MNI
(Minimum Number of Individuals) and skeletal survival rate (Brain,
1981; Lyman, 1994) were calculated. Skeletal survival rate estimates the proportion between the elements recovered and those
expected (Brain, 1969). For the calculation of this, the following
formula was used: %survivali ¼ MNE  100/number of elementi in
the animal skeleton (MNEe)  MNI.
The age at death of the animals is established mainly from teeth
(Silver, 1969; Bökonyi, 1972; Riglet, 1977; Mariezkurrena and Altuna,
1983; Azorit et al., 2002). Nevertheless, the epiphyseal fusion and the
cortical tissue are also used in this study (Silver, 1969; Barone, 1976).
The breaks on faunal remains were analysed and classiﬁed
according to Villa and Mahieu (1991). The outline (transverse,
curved/V-shaped, longitudinal), fracture angle (oblique, right,
mixed) and fracture edge (smooth, jagged) were analysed.
Alterations observed on bone surfaces were treated at both
macroscopic and microscopic level. For the microscopic study an
Olympus SZ11 stereoscopic (magniﬁcation up to 110) and ESEM (FEI
QUANTA 600) were used. Damage observed on the faunal remains
included cutmarks, intentional bone breakage and carnivore
toothmarks.
The incisions are the only type of cutmark identiﬁed. The chopmarks and scrapes are not documented (Binford, 1981; Potts and
Shipman, 1981; Shipman, 1983; Shipman and Rose, 1983; Shipman
et al., 1984). The incisions are striations with a linear outline of
variable length, width, and depth. The incisions have a V-shaped
section and display internal microstriation (Potts and Shipman,
1981). In some cases, Hertzian cones (Bromage and Boyde, 1984),
shoulder effects and barbs (Shipman and Rose, 1983) were observed.
The analysis of cutmarks took into account the number of striations,
location on the anatomical element, distribution over the surface
(isolated, clustered, crossed), orientation regarding the longitudinal
axis of the bone (oblique, longitudinal, transverse) and delineation
(straight or curved).
Surface damage caused during the bone breakage was also analysed and the diagnostic elements of anthropogenic breakage were
documented on faunal remains from the TD10-1 sample: percussion
pits or percussion marks (Blumenschine and Selvaggio, 1988;
Pickering and Egeland, 2006), percussion notches and impact
ﬂakes (Capaldo and Blumenschine, 1994; Pickering and Egeland,
2006). Percussion marks refer to pits and striae. Diagnostic
morphology and conﬁguration of percussion pits and striations are
described by Blumenschine and Selvaggio (1988). Pits are often
closely associated with and/or have emanating from them the
patches of striae that result from slippage of stone against bone

2053

during impact events. Percussion notches are semicircular shaped
indentations on fracture edges with corresponding negative ﬂake
scars. Impact ﬂakes refer to shaft fragments produced by hammerstone percussion that display the same basic technical attributes of
percussion as it occurs on stone ﬂakes.
The carnivore toothmarks identiﬁed on bone remains in the
sample of TD10-1 were mainly pits, punctures and scores (Haynes,
1980, 1983b; Binford, 1981; Stiner, 1994; Blumenschine, 1995; inter
alia). Pits consist of superﬁcial marks lacking a long axis, and
punctures are deep pits that penetrate deeply through the cortical
bone or along the edges of an intact or broken bone. Scores are
surface marks with a longitudinal axis more than four times the
perpendicular axis. Regarding the breakage, crenulated edges are
mainly observed. These present small negative scars on the fracture
and longitudinal breakages.
3. Level TD10-1 at the Gran Dolina site
The Gran Dolina site is one of the many caves located in the
karstic complex of the Sierra de Atapuerca (Burgos). It is a cave about
18 m high, ﬁlled with sediments of the Lower and Middle Pleistocene. These ﬁllings are divided into 11 stratigraphical levels. Level
TD10-1 consists of a red sandy clay matrix with angular limestone
centimeter sized clasts (Parés and Pérez-González, 1999). This level is
dated by TL, ESR and U-series between 250 and 350 Ky (Falguères
et al., 1999; Berger et al., 2008) (Fig. 1). Lithic artefacts recovered at
TD10-1 are classiﬁed at a technological level as a transitional
moment between Mode 2 and Mode 3 and are developed primarily
with local materials: neogene ﬂint is the most common raw material.
Other used raw materials are quartzite, calcarenite and to a lesser
extent, cretaceous ﬂint and quartz. All categories of the operational
chain are represented; however, the most abundant elements are the
un-retouched ﬂakes (Rodríguez Álvarez, 2004; Menéndez, 2009).
The sample from TD10-1 analysed here provides 16 species of
macromammals: Ursus arctos, Canis lupus, Vulpes vulpes, P. leo fossilis,
Lynx sp., Hystrix sp., Stephanorhinus cf. hemitoechus, Equus ferus,
Equus hydruntinus, Sus scrofa, Megaloceros giganteus, Dama dama
clactoniana, Cervus elaphus, Bison sp., Hemitragus bonali, Capreolus
capreolus (Table 1). In general, adult specimens dominate the

assemblage (66.67%). The skeletal representation of herbivores is
characterised by the abundance of stylopodials (femur and
humerus), zygopodials (radius and tibia) and mandibles and by a low
representation of the axial skeleton (vertebrae and ribs). This
skeletal representation coincides with the anatomical elements with
high medullary value (Binford, 1981; Emerson, 1993).
Analysis of bone breakage shows that curved/V-shaped
predominate along with oblique angles, and smooth edges. This
degree of bone breakage at TD10-1 is related to green bone
breakage according to the criteria established by Villa and Mahieu
(1991). Surface damage caused during breakage of the bones has
also been analysed. Diagnostic elements of intentional anthropogenic breakage are recognised on 1329 bone fragments. These
diagnostic elements are mainly percussion notches on the shafts of
long bones and impact ﬂakes.
The presence of cutmarks also suggests an association between
the hominids and faunal record from TD10-1. Cutmarks are documented on 584 bone remains. These are mainly located on remains
of large and medium-sized animals (greater than 100 kg in weight).
Several cutmarks are associated with the deﬂeshing of large muscle
masses. In these cases, the incisions are long and are located
longitudinally or obliquely on the diaphyses of long bones. Short
and deep cutmarks, related to dismemberment and disarticulation
of the anatomical portions, are also identiﬁed on some epiphyses.
On the other hand, carnivore damage (toothmarks and bone
breakage) on the faunal assemblage is low. Only 4.09% of the bone
remains show carnivore activities. These marks are documented on
all the animals, especially on medium and small-size animals
(individuals with weight below 100 kg). Pits, scores and crenulated
edges are the most abundant marks. These are mainly located on
diaphysis fragments. These characteristics do not coincide with
those described for the carnivore dens (Cruz-Uribe, 1991).
Several types of evidences provide information about the
methods used to obtain animal nutrients. Some researchers suggest
that the main element to be considered is the skeletal representation
of the different taxa identiﬁed in the assemblage (Binford, 1981;
Brain, 1981; Bunn, 1981; Shipman and Rose, 1983; Klein, 1989;
Lyman, 1994; Stiner, 1994; Marean and Kim, 1998; inter alia). This
must be considered in conjunction with the age proﬁles of the
animals (Gaudzinski and Roebroeks, 2000) and the localisation of
processing marks on the carcasses (Domínguez-Rodrigo, 1999;
Domínguez-Rodrigo and Rayne Pickering, 2003; DomínguezRodrigo and Barba, 2006; inter alia). From this perspective, the
characteristics identiﬁed at TD10-1 faunal assemblage (adult animals,
skeletal elements with high nutritional value, cutmarks related to
large muscle masses removal and low impact of carnivores on the
faunal assemblage) suggest that the anthropic access to animals is
mainly primary and immediate, so, the TD10-1 hominids obtain the
prey mainly from hunting practices.
Similar characteristics are identiﬁed in the work of Rosell
(2001), who studied the 1998e1999 excavation seasons from
TD10. From this perspective, continuity can be observed on faunal
records from upper sublevels of TD10.
4. Data presentation
The sample from TD10-1 (excavation seasons 2000e2001)
provided 11,081 faunal remains, of which 1811 were identiﬁed
taxonomically. Among bones identiﬁed at the species level, 47
(2.59%) belong to carnivores: U. arctos, C. lupus, V. vulpes, P. leo fossilis
and Lynx sp. Of these, 17 remains are attributed to P. leo fossilis.
The archaeostratigraphical distribution of lion fossils in the
faunal assemblage shows a line clearly visible in both the NS section
as the EW. Therefore, we can distinguish at least a single event
related to lions (Fig. 2a, b).

2055

The MNE is 15, mostly represented by phalanges (4), metacarpi
(2) and mandibles (2) while the rest of the anatomical elements are
only represented by one bone. Two reﬁts are located in the assemblage: two fragments from the same radius and two fragments from
the same ulna. The MNI is 1 established from the most common
skeletal element (mandible) comparing paired elements, age and
size. Regarding age of death, the identiﬁed individual is adult.
According to the skeletal survival rate, a biased anatomical
representation is observed (Table 2). The most striking thing is the
complete absence of vertebrae, pelvic girdles, tibiae and femuri. We
must bear in mind that the high degree of fragmentation observed
in the bone assemblage often makes both speciﬁc and anatomical
identiﬁcation difﬁcult. From this perspective, it is possible that these
absent elements, especially those belonging to limb bones, are
included in the category of long bones of medium-sized animals and
have not been identiﬁed at the highest level. Because of the high
dispersion observed on lion remains, it is also possible that these
missing elements are in an area not excavated. The TD10-1 excavation, despite its wide extension, presents unexcavated areas, such
as east and south areas of the site where stratigraphic proﬁles have
been left and the west area, where the railway trench made at the
turn of the 19the20th century has disrupted the sediments (Fig. 2c).
On the other hand, the faunal assemblage is dominated by fresh
bone fragmentation. Analysis of bone breakage shows that curved/
V-shapes predominate, along with oblique angles and smooth
edges (Villa and Mahieu, 1991). Nevertheless, post-depositional
fragmentation of bones is also identiﬁed, speciﬁcally the fragmentation by pressure of sediments. Therefore, stepped or
columnar fractures are also observed (Marshall, 1989; Lyman,
1994). In the case of lion remains, both types of fragmentation
are observed: fresh on a radius and dry on an ulna (Fig. 3).
Most of the alterations observed on the lion remains are both
anthropogenic (17.64%) and made by carnivores (29.41%). The
relatively high occurrence of cutmarks on lion bones (11.76%)
indicates an association between hominids and this predator. These
are identiﬁed on a phalanx II and on a rib. Incisions on ventral
surface of the rib are predominant (Table 3) (Fig. 4). The action
performed (viscera removal, skinning and deﬂeshing) is recorded
according to morphology, emplacement and distribution of
anthropogenic incisions. Surface damage caused during breakage of

the bones is also analysed. One percussion notch is located on
a proximal metaphysis of a radius.
As regards carnivore damage, 29.41% of lion remains show
modiﬁcations in form of pits and scores (Table 4). The dimensions
and morphologies of the toothmarks mainly coincide with smallsized carnivores, such as foxes (Andrews, 1995; Andrews and
Fernández-Jalvo, 1997; Selvaggio and Wilder, 2001; DomínguezRodrigo and Piqueras, 2003; Yravedra, 2003e04).
On the other hand, 30 remains belonging to other carnivores
were recovered at the same level. These correspond to 6 individuals:
2 wolf, 2 foxes, 1 lynx and 1 bear. All the animals are adults except
2 infantile belonging to C. lupus and V. vulpes. The frequency of
modiﬁcations caused by hominids and carnivores on these remains
is low: 1 bone fragment presents cutmarks (3.33%) and 6 show
carnivore damage (20%). The anthropogenic activity is only documented on the pelvic girdle of V. vulpes adult individual, speciﬁcally
one cutmark (oblique incision) on the lateral surface of the isquium.
On the other hand, toothmarks (mainly pits) are observed on
a metatarsus IV of C. lupus, and a mandible and a calcaneus of V.
vulpes. Furthermore, a diaphyseal cylinder on a radius of fox and two
digested teeth of U. arctos are identiﬁed. However, the majority of
the carnivore remains are not modiﬁed (76.67%) (Table 5). Excluding
the cutmarks documented on an adult fox and on an adult lion, the
presence of these non-human predators in this faunal assemblage
may suggest sporadic events of small and large carnivores during

5. Discussion
The lion remains identiﬁed in the TD10-1 sample of Gran Dolina
show sufﬁcient evidence to attribute their presence to human
activity during the Middle Pleistocene, speciﬁcally MIS 9. The
presence of cutmarks on bones indicates an association between
the hominids and the lion. These marks have enabled us to
reconstruct the human consumption sequence of this predator.
However, ascertaining the technique of obtaining these large
carnivores is a complex matter. In ethnoarchaeological terms, some
cases of lion hunting are present, such as those documented in
Kenya and Tanzania by the Maasai, in Namibia by the Khoikhois
(Hottentots) or in the North of Tanzania by the Hadza. In the case of
the Maasai, the hunting of lions is related to initiation rites in
which, after killing the predator, the initiated obtains the group’s
respect (Saitori and Beckwith, 1980; Saitoti, 1988). A different case
is the one observed among the Hottentots. In the past, this group
practiced lion hunting with dogs (African Lion Hound) with the aim
of eliminating competitors and protecting their livestock (Lutman,
1993). On the other hand, the Hadza kill large carnivores when
a confrontation is produced when obtaining prey. O’Connell et al.
(1988) documented an episode of lion hunting as a result of
a direct confrontation for the prey.
In the case of TD10-1, the cutmarks identiﬁed on the ventral
surface of a lion rib indicate anthropic access to the viscera. The
internal organs of the thorax are the ﬁrst parts to disappear in the
consumption sequence of hunting carnivores (Binford, 1981;
Blumenschine, 1985, 1986a,b; O’Connell et al., 1988; Selvaggio,
1994; Domínguez-Rodrigo, 1994; Capaldo, 1997; DomínguezRodrigo, 1999). For this reason, if the TD10-1 hominids eviscerated, the access to this predator should be primary and immediate
and the hunting could have been the technique used to obtain it.
The purpose of the lion capture is difﬁcult to show archaeologically. Besides, this is an isolated case in a context, in which the
main prey are red deer and horses and, therefore, the hunting of
a big cat should be understood more as an opportunistic and
sporadic episode, rather than a regular activity of the human
groups at this site. Despite being an isolated case, the lion hunting
suggests that Middle Pleistocene hominids are capable of facing
this type of animals successfully. We must take into account that
the lions are situated in a very high position within the food chain
and obtaining them is dangerous and fraught with risk. The fact
that no pathologies have been documented on the P. leo fossilis

remains, which indicate possible diseases or injuries of a traumatic
nature that make this predator vulnerable, suggests that the
hominids could be located in a similar position in the food chain or
even higher up than these large carnivores.

Once the lion has been obtained, the processing begins, starting
with the skinning and the viscera removal. Cutmarks located on the
distal metaphysis of a second phalanx can be related to the skinning
or tendum removal. The skin and tendum are potentially resources

example is the cutmarks located on a dhole (Cuon cf. alpinus)
mandible from Cova Negra (Pérez Ripoll et al., 2010) or the use of the
skin of a leopard (Panthera pardus) at the site of Los Torrejones Cave
(Arribas et al., 1997), both in Spain. Nevertheless, most of the examples of anthropic use of carnivores come from Upper Palaeolithic
sites. From this perspective, there are numerous cases of the utilization of the lynx for food in some localities such as Peña de la
Estebanvela (Yravedra, 2005), Cova Beneito or Les Cendres (Martínez
Valle, 1996) in Spain and some examples of the anthropic processing
of the badger, fox and bear at the Italian site of Polesini (Stiner, 1994).
Evidence has also been documented on fox remains at some French
sites, such as Combe Saunière (Chauvière and Castel, 2004).

for human groups and these can have different functions. In any case,
the skinning is required to access the meat and then the content of
the bones. Cutmarks related to deﬂeshing are also documented on
external surface of a rib. These incisions are associated with the back
muscles removal (Trapezius and/or Latissimus dorsi).
With the available elements, two fracturing techniques can be
suggested in the case of the radius: (1) active or thrown percussion
and (2) passive or direct percussion (Giusberti and Peretto, 1991;
Anconetani, 1999). Active or thrown percussion is produced when
the skeletal element is hit directly against an object (stone) and
passive or direct percussion is caused when the bone is held on the
ground or on an object that acts as an anvil and is hit with an
instrument generally made of stone (hammerstone).
Once the resources have been used, the lion bones are left
behind like the rest of the animals processed at TD10-1. Once the
human groups leave the camp, the smell given off by the remains
can attract other predators that act as scavengers in search of
potentially consumable resources (Binford, 1981; Rosell and Blasco,
2008, 2009). The number and dimensions of the toothmarks
identiﬁed on the lion skeleton may be due to the activity of small
scavengers, probably small canines, such as foxes. Nevertheless, at
certain times, toothmarks of larger dimensions have also been
observed, which could be related to large predators, such as hyenas.
Further evidence, which corroborates the marauding activity of the
carnivores at TD10-1, is the presence of overlapping marks on some
herbivores remains (Blasco and Rosell, 2009). These correspond to
carnivore toothmarks situated over cutmarks.
In general, this study provides data on the relationship between
human groups and big cats of the Middle Pleistocene from evidence
based on the occasional anthropic use of a lion from TD10-1. Although
the utilization of carnivores is not isolated at this level (cutmarks on
isquium of an adult fox), the processing marks on big cat remains are
not common at sites of similar chronologies. However, in more
modern chronologies, the speciﬁc use of other large carnivores, such
as the cave bear (Ursus spelaeus), has been suggested at some sites of
the European Middle Palaeolithic. This is the case of Arcy-sur-Cure
(David, 1997), Biache Saint Vast (Auguste, 1991, 1995) and Prélétang
(Tillet, 2002) in France or of Sant’Agostino (Stiner, 1994), the Grotta
delle Fate and Madonna dell’Arma in Italy (Tillet, 2002). Another

The study of the relationship between hominids and carnivores
during the Pleistocene has currently been a highly debated topic.
Relations between both predators have been interpreted in multiple
ways: lack of contact between them, relations of dependency or
competition for resources and occupied space, etc. The anthropogenic use of these animals as food is not common at the Middle
Pleistocene sites, especially in the case of big cats. From this
perspective, the TD10-1 sample provides sufﬁcient evidence to
show the human use of a lion (P. leo fossilis) during MIS 9. The
diagnostic elements of human activity, identiﬁed on the lion
remains, allow us to document some episodes of the processing
sequence: cutmarks related to the skinning and deﬂeshing are
identiﬁed and the human use of bone marrow is documented by
diagnostic elements of anthropogenic breakage. All these evidences
suggest that the lion was used for food.
On the other hand, cutmarks identiﬁed on ventral surface on a rib
and related to viscera removal can only be understood from
a primary and immediate anthropic access to the animal. Therefore,
the hunting may be the most probable technique used by the
hominids to catch the lion. From this, the direct interaction between
hominids and this big cat at level TD10-1 is documented. However,
this is an isolated case in a context, in which the main prey are
ungulates, and therefore, the hunting of a lion should be understood
as a sporadic episode rather than a systematic activity of the human
groups at this site. Nevertheless, the hunting of this predator
suggests that the hominids of the Middle Pleistocene are successful
hunters able to face the large predators. In this paper, we have
shown that the hunting of large carnivores is another possibility for
understanding the relationships between hominids and carnivores
during the Middle Pleistocene.
