Abstract
In order to resolve long-standing issues surrounding the age of the Skhul early modern humans, new analyses have
been conducted, including the dating of four well-provenanced fossils by ESR and U-series. If the Skhul burials took
place within a relatively short time span, then the best age estimate lies between 100 and 135 ka. This result agrees very
well with TL ages obtained from burnt ﬂint of 119G18 ka (Mercier et al., 1993). However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that the material associated with the Skhul IX burial is older than those of Skhul II and Skhul V. These and
other recent age estimates suggest that the three burial sites, Skhul, Qafzeh and Tabun are broadly contemporaneous,
falling within the time range of 100 to 130 ka. The presence of early representatives of both early modern humans and
Neanderthals in the Levant during Marine Isotope Stage 5 inevitably complicates attempts at segregating these
populations by date or archaeological association. Nevertheless, it does appear that the oldest known symbolic burials
are those of early modern humans at Skhul and Qafzeh. This supports the view that, despite the associated Middle
Palaeolithic technology, elements of modern human behaviour were represented at Skhul and Qafzeh prior to 100 ka.

Introduction
The site of Es Skhul is located at Mount
Carmel, South of Haifa, in the canyon of Nahal
Mearot, a few hundred metres away from the
Neanderthal site of Tabun. Figure 1 shows a site
sketch and the projected positions of the human
fossils, Skhul I to IX, in the horizontal plan as well
as in a north-south and east-west cross sections.
From the positioning of the bones there seems
little doubt that most of the humans were buried
intentionally. Until the completion of the 1932
excavations (Garrod and Bate, 1937), the human
fossils were considered to represent eight diﬀerent
individuals since it was thought that specimens II
and III belonged to the same individual (McCown,

317

1937). An additional specimen, a mandible of
a child, was found later in the laboratory when
developing a larger sediment block that contained
the remains of VII.
The site was subdivided into three main layers
(McCown, 1937; McCown and Keith, 1939):
Layer A (20 to 50 cm thick) contained a mixture
of Natuﬁan, Aurignacian and Mousterian stone
tools, Layer B (about 200 cm thick and bearing all
the human remains) Mousterian stone tools, and
Layer C (shallow sandy deposits at the base of the
sedimentary sequence) yielded only a sparse lithic
industry and no faunal remains.
Layer B was subdivided into two phases mainly
distinguished by their hardness. The upper hard
earth unit B1 resembled plaster of Paris, whereas the

lower breccia B2 was similar to concrete. McCown
(1937) observed that layer B was remarkably free
from broken rocks and small stones and that ﬂints
and bones were scattered in an even manner
throughout layers B1 and B2. The ﬂints, which
showed thermal pitting and discoloration by ﬁre,
were almost always patinated in Layer B1 whilst in
B2 the artifacts were usually unpatinated. For none
of the burials could it be established from which
level they were inserted into the deeper sediments.
The lithics of Skhul Layers B have been
compared with those of Tabun C and Qafzeh
(Garrod and Bate, 1937; Bar-Yosef and Meignen,
1992), while the macro-faunal remains in Layer B
appeared to correspond with those of Tabun C to
D (Bate, 1937).
Skhul has been the subject of detailed dating
studies yielding closed system ESR ages on faunal
teeth in the range of about 55 to 100 ka (Stringer
et al., 1989) and 46 to 88 ka (McDermott et al.,
1993), U-series ages on faunal teeth in the range of
43 to 80 ka (McDermott et al., 1993) and TL on
burnt ﬂint in the range of about 99 to 134 ka
(Mercier et al., 1993). Because the human remains
were apparently intentionally buried, their precise
relationships with the surrounding sediments are
unclear - burial may have taken place from today’s
surface, from level A, or from within level B. Thus,
the age of the human remains is still subject to
discussion. In a recent paper (Grün and Stringer,
2000), we presented our results on an ESR and
U-series study of a tooth from the Tabun Neanderthal skeleton C1 which, in our opinion, demonstrated that this skeleton was buried from Level B
into Level C and is thus considerably older
(122G16 ka) than a recent gamma spectrometric
analysis of bones had suggested (%40 ka:
Schwarcz et al., 1998).
Apart from the problems introduced by intrusive
burial, many of the ﬁnds from McCown and
Garrod’s excavations have no coordinates or layer
assignments. Thus, their exact provenance and
relationship to the human remains are generally
unknown, and this unfortunately applies to the
faunal samples 521, 522, and 851 to 856 presented in
this paper. In order to circumvent the stratigraphic
uncertainties surrounding the age of the Skhul
human remains, we pursued the strategy of ana-

lysing four specimens that were more precisely
provenanced. First, we directly analysed a molar
from the Skhul II individual, and second, bone
fragments from Skhul IX. Two of the Skhul burials,
V and IX, contained associated mammal bones,
which were also analysed. Skhul II was found at
a depth of 1.40 m below the surface in partly
hardened earth and consisted of ‘‘..about two
dozen pieces of skull, ten very worn teeth and
a symphyseal part of the mandible bearing the sockets
of the incisor, canine, pre-molar, and the ﬁrst molar
teeth’’ (McCown (1937). Sample 1057 is a tooth
from a bovid skull directly associated with Skhul IX
(Fig. 2A). It was found in the hardest breccia of the
site at a depth of 2.15 m below the surface and its
inferior surface nearly touched the rock. McCown
(1937) reported ‘‘The ninth.had been buried 0.90 m
south of No. V but 65 cm deeper in the deposit.The
bones lay very nearly upon the rock ﬂoor.A few cm
north of the broken..end of the femur was a large
mass of badly crushed bone.the nearly complete.
skull of a large bovid..The hole made to receive this
ox skull destroyed not only the legs but most of the
skeleton as well. The ox skull..must certainly be
regarded as a later intrusion’’. The exact nature of
the association of this specimen with the Skhul IX
burial, and any symbolic signiﬁcance it may have
had, is therefore uncertain. It may have been of
greater age, and merely replaced in the grave ﬁll, or
it may have been inserted, with or without symbolic
purpose, after the time of burial.
Finally, sample 1058 is a tooth from a pig
mandible that was found with the remains of
Skhul V (see Fig. 2B). The burial was located in
hard matrix at a depth of 1.25 m below the surface,
a few cm above the rock ﬂoor. McCown (1937)
remarked ‘‘In the angle formed by the left forearm
and right humerus was the mandible of a very large
pig..There can be no doubt, from its position, and
from the fact that the left forearm rests upon the
broken, hinder ends of the mandible, that its
inclusion in the grave was deliberate.’’ This
specimen, the lower jaw of a large boar, is by far
the best-preserved large mammal fossil from
Skhul, presumably because it was intentionally
buried with the human body. Drawings and
photographs of the excavated skeleton conﬁrm
that it was originally enclosed in the arms of the

corpse, with the strong inference of symbolic
intent. The signiﬁcance of this discovery cannot
be overestimated as the only other claimed
symbolic burial of comparable antiquity is that

of the Qafzeh adolescent, apparently buried
clasping fallow deer antlers (Vandermeersch,
1970). A more recent study also established the
use of Ochre at Qafzeh (Hovers et al., 2003). Some

320

workers have suggested that the Levantine early
modern humans should not really be termed
‘‘modern’’ at all because they lacked symbolic
behaviour (Klein, 2000). Therefore, establishing
the age of the Skhul V burial and its symbolic
association is particularly important.

Experimental Procedures and Results
For this study, we have carried out TIMS
U-series dating of faunal material, dentine of
Skhul II and a bone surface sample of Skhul IX;
and gamma spectrometric U-series dating on ﬁve
smaller bone fragments of Skhul IX. Additional
faunal material, as well as an M3 enamel fragment
of Skhul II, was analysed by ESR.
TIMS U-Series Dating
Thermal ionisation mass spectrometric (TIMS)
U-series analyses of the faunal material followed
established procedures (McDermott et al., 1993).
We also analysed a small surface sample (171 mg)
of one of the Skhul IX bones, as well as the dentine
of the tooth from Skhul II, following recently
described procedures (Grün et al., 1999). The
results are listed in Table 1.
Gamma Spectrometric U-Series Dating
Five smaller bone fragments of Skhul IX
(Fig. 5) were analysed by gamma spectrometric

U-series dating (Simpson and Grün, 1998)). The
fragments were sealed together into a heavy duty
plastic bag with most of the air extracted and
counted for 56 days to ensure reasonable counting
statistics. The standard was a 80 ppm BL5 powder
also sealed in a plastic bag. All emission peaks
were normalised on the 63 keV peak from 238U
and isotope ratios were calculated with the use of
the BL5 standard (for more details on the
mathematical procedures and error propagation,
see Simpson and Grün (1998)). The results are
shown in Table 2. The data can be used for open
system modelling. Concordance is achieved when
the 230Th/238U - 231Pa/235U data point coincides
with the target 234U/238U line (bold line in Fig. 6).
For more details on open system Pa/U-Th/U
modelling, see Simpson and Grün (1998) and
Cheng et al. (1998). The concordance diagrams
(Fig. 6) indicate that the linear U-uptake model
seems more appropriate than the early U-uptake
model.
ESR Dating
Apart from a few small remnants, all of the
sediments at Skhul are now removed and it is not
possible to measure the gamma dose rate in situ.
We have therefore analysed a series of sediment
samples (see Table 3). 21 samples were collected
from larger specimen in the Natural History
Museum (NHM) and 10 were attached to the teeth.
The NHM samples yielded average values of 1.9G
0.8 ppm U, 2.1G1.2 ppm Th and 0.41G0.21 % K

Therefore, the sets were combined to calculate the
average inﬁnite sediment matrix dose rate. Including a water content of 10G5%, the average
sediment values of 2.2G0.9 ppm U, 2.8G2.0 ppm Th
and 0.48G0.26 %K convert to 444G137 mGy/a
using the dose rate values of Adamiec and Aitken
(1998). It can reasonably be assumed that the
sediment adhering to a tooth provides a better
estimate of the gamma dose rate in the immediate
surroundings of the specimen (the volume of about
5 cm around a tooth provides about 25% of the
external gamma dose rate, but only about 0.5% of
the mass of the total volume contributing to the
external gamma dose rate, see e.g. Nathan and
Grün, 2003). To account for the diﬀerences
between the individual sediment samples of
a speciﬁc tooth and the calculated average
sediment, the individual gamma dose rates for
the specimens were calculated using a 25% contribution from the attached sediment samples and
75% from the averaged value. Note that all
gamma dose rate values remain well within the
range of the average gamma dose rate of
444G137 mGy/a. Samples 1057 and 1058 were
reported to be close to the base rock. The
limestone has signiﬁcantly lower concentrations
of radioactive elements and in an earlier study,
a gamma measurement in the bedrock of Tabun,
a cave which occurs in the same limestone ridge as
Skhul, yielded 90 mGy/a. This means that at the
interface of the sediment with the bedrock, the
average gamma dose rate is about 267G69 mGy/a
(50% of the gamma dose rate from each the
sediment and the bedrock). At distances of 2 cm
and 5 cm, the average gamma dose rates increase
to about 356G103 and 409G123 mGy/a, respectively. For the bovid tooth (1057) two cases were
calculated (i) that it was within 0 and 5 cm of the
bedrock (starred in the tables and ﬁgures), and
(ii) that it was more than 5 cm removed. For the
pig (1058) it is most likely that it was at least 5 cm

322

removed from the bed rock (see also projections of
the burial of Skhul V in Fig. 1). The site is partly
shielded by the Carmel Mountain ridge between 40
and 90  which therefore causes part of the cosmic
dose rate (10-50% of the hard component) to be
shielded. For an average depth of 1.75G0.25 m
(see Fig. 1), a cosmic dose rate of 116G17 mGy/a
was obtained when using the cosmic dose attenuation functions of Prescott and Hutton (1994). For
the burial samples, the depths reported by
McCown (1937) were used. Based on the sediment
analyses, the average external gamma and cosmic
dose rates total 560G137 mGy/a. As the deposit
‘‘as a whole was remarkably free from broken rock
and small stones’’ McCown (1937), a possible
‘‘lumpy environment’’ (Schwarcz, 1994), i.e. an
unknown amount of limestone holders inﬂuencing
the local gamma dose rate, is of ﬂoccinaucical
signiﬁcance.
In order to assess whether the calculated
combined gamma and cosmic dose rates of
560G137 mGy/a are reasonable, we also carried
out four gamma spectrometric measurements at
the site (for locations see Fig. 1; all measurements
include the cosmic ray contribution and have an
uncertainty of about 10%). Measurement #1
(290 mGy/a) was carried out at the deep end of
the cave in limestone with some breccia; #2
(360 mGy/a) at the entrance of the cave, just out
of the overhang, in a similar environment as the
previous measurement; #3 (625 mGy/a) in reddish
sediment in a small alcove; and #4 (530 mGy/a) in
the slope outside the cave which contained 20 cm
of soil with boulders beneath. It was thought that
the slope contained a high amount of spoil
material from the original excavation. Apart from
the last measurement, which was measured at
a depth of 15 cm, all measurements had a full 4p
symmetry. The diﬀerence between measurements
#1 and #2 is the increased cosmic ray dose rate
closer to the entrance of the cave. Measurements
#3 and #4 agree well with the calculations from the
sediments, particularly when considering the higher
cosmic ray component in these measurements
(both measurements are close to the surface and
#4 is less shielded by the Mount Carmel ridge).
A question can be raised: how much are the
samples inﬂuenced by bones close to the tooth

samples (e.g. the bovid skull, the mandible of the
pig, or other bones in the close vicinity, see Fig. 2)?
Nathan and Grün (2003) carried out a simulation
of the external gamma dose rate for a tooth using
the 3D scan of Skhul V. They showed that
a human mandible and skull may provide a contribution of up to about 15% to the total external
gamma dose rate. However, at the same time,
about 15% of the sediment dose rate is shielded by
skull, so that the overall eﬀect of the presence of
the bones is diminished. Using similar computational strategies as Nathan and Grün (2003), it is
estimated that both the pig mandible and the
bovid skull may provide between 10 and 15% of
the external gamma dose rate to samples 1058 and
1057. The inﬂuence of any larger bones that are
further away from a sample is signiﬁcantly less
than this value. In order to estimate the inﬂuence
of the bones, inﬁnite matrix dose rates were
calculated for bone types using the most diﬀering
U-series data of our set: the dentine of Skhul II
and the surface of Skhul IX. To simplify the
calculations for a Skhul II type bone, it was
assumed that all uranium migrated into the tooth
at a time that is represented by the U-series age
(see Nathan and Grün, 2003). Figure 3 shows the
gamma dose rate contributions of Skhul II and
Skhul IX type bones on samples with a given age.
The average inﬁnite matrix dose rate of a Skhul IX
type bone over its age of 131 ka, 453 mGy/a, is
indistinguishable from the average sediment dose
rate of 444G137 mGy/a. If a sample was deposited
later near a Skhul IX type bone, the average
gamma dose increases because of ingrowth of
230
Th. The average gamma dose rate from a Skhul
II type bone is signiﬁcantly higher for a 32 ka
sample (1115 mGy/a), but decreases rapidly for
older samples due to delayed U-migration. Even in
the most extreme case (here for the last 32 ka),
a 15% dose rate contribution from a Skhul II type
bone would have an overall eﬀect of about
100 mGy/a, but this would decrease rapidly if
any U-uptake had taken place. For bones older than
60 ka, any aberrations of the external gamma dose
ﬁeld through the presence of bones seem minor.
The mammal teeth were analysed along established procedures (Grün, 1989). The dose value
and its error were determined by linearisation of

R. Grün et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 49 (2005) 316e334

(Grün, 2002; Grün et al., 2001). Dose response
curves were calculated for each angular step, but
the data sets where the ﬁtting procedure produced
large residuals (O 40% of the minimum residual)
were disregarded (Curnoe et al., 2001). A dose
value of 93.8G7.8 Gy was obtained. The uranium
concentration of the tooth fragment was determined by laser ablation ICP-MS (Eggins et al.,
2003). ESR ages were calculated for the early
U-uptake (EU) and linear U-uptake (LU) models.
In conventional ESR studies it is often assumed
that the correct age of a sample lies between the
EU and LU age estimates. The results of the ESR
analysis are shown in Table 4, along with further
analytical information in the footnotes.

alpha eﬃciency was set to 0.13G0.02 (Grün and
Katzenberger-Apel, 1994). There is also a need to
revise the previously published ESR dates for
Skhul (Stringer et al., 1989), because of various
advances in the dating technique during the last
decade (this was summarised recently in the
reassessment of ESR dates from Border Cave
(Grün and Beaumont, 2001)).
The dose of the human tooth was measured by
removing a small enamel fragment from the tooth,
following the procedures of Grün (1995) which
were also used for the dating of other human
enamel fragments, such as Florisbad (Grün et al.,
1996), Tabun C1 (Robertson and Grün, 2000;
Grün and Stringer, 2000), Swartkrans (Curnoe
et al., 2001) and Border Cave BC5 (Grün et al.,
2003). The fragment was mounted in an automated
goniometer and measured after each irradiation in
10  steps over 360  (rotation relative to the
external magnetic ﬁeld). The dose response curves
were constructed using natural spectrum ﬁtting

Both ESR and U-series dating results on faunal
materials are dependent on the process of Uuptake. The combination of both methods allows
the determination of the U-uptake history. The USESR uptake model is based on a continuous Uuptake function (Grün and McDermott, 1994),
whereas the alternative (CSUS-ESR) model assumes that the uranium migrates into the sample at
a time that corresponds to the apparent closed
system U-series age (Grün, 2000). The latter model
provides a maximum possible open system age for
given ESR and U-series data. Sample 854 shows
that the U-series results for the dentine and enamel
are very similar. This was also assumed for the open
system age calculations for the other teeth, where
only one U-series analysis, either on enamel or
dentine, was carried out. The assumption that
enamel and dentine have the same apparent Useries ages does not introduce a signiﬁcant age
uncertainty, because the enamel dose rates are
small compared to the total dose rates. A sensitivity
test shows that if the apparent U-series ages of the
enamel were considerably younger than the dentine
ages (using an age of 0 ka for the enamel), it would
have no eﬀect on the age calculations of SKII
(because the U-concentration in enamel is very
low), and the crucial samples 1057 and 1058 could
be older by a maximum of about 6 and 3%,
respectively. This maximum possible eﬀect is well
within the error range of the results and has no

Discussion of Age Results
Before the dating results of the samples are
discussed, there is a need for some general stratigraphic considerations. There is no doubt that the
accumulation of the archaeological layers at Skhul
took place over some considerable, yet unknown,
time span. The stone tools were originally correlated to Tabun C (McCown, 1936), which has been

dated by TL to 150 to 190 ka (Mercier et al., 1995;
Mercier and Valladas, 2003) and to 105 to 160 ka
by ESR (Grün and Stringer, 2000). Subsequently,
the lithics were compared to those from Tabun B
and Kebara (Jelinek, 1982). If this was the case, the
archaeological layers at Skhul could have been
deposited over a long time period: Tabun B has
been dated to about 120 ka (Grün et al., 1991,
Grün and Stringer, 2000) and Kebara to about
60 ka (Valladas et al., 1987; Schwarcz et al., 1989).
On the other hand, the sedimentation of the
archaeological layers at Skhul could present
a relatively short phase within the Tabun B phase.
If the sedimentation of the archaeological layers
at Skhul presents a longer phase, then it becomes
important to know at what stage the burials were
inserted into the sedimentary sequence. Many of the
burials are close to the bedrock and covered by more
than 150 cm of sediments. It seems improbable that
deep excavations were carried out prior to the
disposing of the bodies, therefore, the burials most
likely took place well before the sedimentation of
layer B concluded. In general, it can be expected that
the buried material is somewhat younger than the
surrounding sediment. However, if the burial took
place at an early stage of sedimentation, the average
age of layer B and its contents may just as well be
younger than the buried material. Furthermore,
since it is very likely that the graves were ﬁlled with
the excavated material, samples that are found in
loose association with a burial, such as the bovid
skull near Skhul IX, could be signiﬁcantly older
than the burial.
U-series results on dental material
All analyses have been carried out on dentine,
except for sample 522 where enamel was analysed.
Thus far, we have observed that the U-concentrations and U-series ages are quite homogeneous
in cross sections and we are unaware of any
dentine samples that show U-leaching (e.g. Grün
et al., 1999; Eggins et al., 2003, in press). This
means that the apparent closed system U-series
results present minimum age estimates for the
dentine samples.
The apparent closed system U-series results
seems to fall into two time intervals: one from about

326

R. Grün et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 49 (2005) 316e334

30 to 45 ka, and one from 80 to 110 ka (see Fig. 4a).
Considering some delays in the U-uptake these
intervals could widen, perhaps to 50 and 120 ka,
respectively. It seems that several U-series results on
human bones from Skhul also fall into the younger
time range around 40 ka (A. Pike pers. comm.). The
results could be explained by two processes:
1) The samples experienced a relatively early
U-uptake and the U-series age assessments
are close to the correct age of the samples. This
would mean that the samples are two distinct
age populations where the younger one is close
to the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic (MP/UP)
transition (as has previously been speculated
for Tabun (Schwarcz et al., 1998)) with the
implication that the burials, or at least some of
them, could be late Middle to early Upper
Palaeolithic, perhaps inserted from Layer A.
On the other hand, if the bovid skull is closely
associated with Skhul IX, then this burial
would be older than 108 ka, implying that
Skhul would have been a burial ground over
a signiﬁcant length of time.

2) Due to the positioning in the site some samples
have experienced a pulse of later U-uptake
which is evidenced by the observation that
many of the apparently younger samples have
enhanced U-concentrations (see Fig. 4b). Were
all samples of the same age population, they
could not be younger than sample 1057 (around
108 ka) and the apparently younger ages were
the result of strongly delayed U-uptake.
Because we did not carry out systematic
U-series analysis to apply the D-A model of Millard
(Millard, 1993; Millard and Hedges, 1996; Pike
et al., 2002), our U-series data alone cannot
resolve this question.
U-series results on bone
The TIMS U-series result on the surface of
a bone fragment from Skhul IX yielded about
131 ka. According to the above mentioned D-A
model, one would expect the oldest age at the
surface of a bone, and this would be closest to the

Fig. 4. A: Apparent U-series ages. The closed system age estimates fall into two ranges, from about 30 to 50 ka and 80 to 120 ka
(shaded areas). This could either mean that the samples are of two diﬀerent age groups where the younger one could be close to the
Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition, of that the samples with higher U concentrations underwent a later stage of U-uptake, as
indicated by Fig. 4(B). B: The samples with younger apparent U-series ages have higher U-concentrations. This could have been caused
by some later U-uptake as indicated by the arrow.

R. Grün et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 49 (2005) 316e334

correct age of the sample. However, since systematic U-series dating on a cross section was not
applied, it cannot be excluded that the 131 ka is an
age overestimate due to U-leaching (e.g. Pike
et al., 2002). The gamma spectrometric Th/U-Pa/U
analysis shows that the whole bone shows open
system behaviour with U-uptake the overriding

327

mechanism (because the apparent Th/U age
is signiﬁcantly older than the Pa/U age: for
more details, see Simpson and Grün, 1998).
Unfortunately, the intrinsically large analytical
errors of gamma spectrometric measurements
do not allow for precise open system modelling.
Nevertheless, the concordance diagrams (Fig. 6)

show that the open system values are well
removed from the 234U/238U concordance.
Within error, concordance is achieved from about
90 ka.
ESR results
The ESR EU and LU age results are shown in
Fig. 7. Without further knowledge of the U-uptake
history, it is often assumed that the correct age of
a sample lies between EU and LU model results.
However, similar to U-series dating, the closed
system EU estimate is a minimum age result for
a sample. Most of the ESR age results actually fall
into the gap lying between the two time ranges of
the U-series result. Only the ESR results of one

tooth (851) fall squarely into the younger time
range of 30 to 50 ka. The other ESR results clearly
imply that the deposits are older than the MP/UP
transition. The bovid tooth (1057) is clearly older
than the majority of the samples, regardless of
whether it was located near the bed rock (starred
samples) or further away. The minimum EU
age estimates for the bovid tooth are about
141G21 ka.
Combined U-series ESR results.
The combination of ESR and U-series age
estimates allows for the modelling of the U-uptake
(Grün et al., 1988). Figure 8A shows the combined
US-ESR results. None of the US-ESR results

linear (LU: diamonds) U-uptake. The two shaded areas, which

cross reference.

fall into the younger age range of the Middle
Palaeolithic. Sample 851, which has the youngest
ESR results, was unfortunately not analysed for
uranium isotopes and, thus, cannot be modelled.
The samples seem to fall into three groups: one
being around 69 ka (samples 854 and 856); the
second one coinciding with the U-series time period
of 80 to 120 ka; and the bovid tooth again showing
considerably older results. The samples do not
show any trend between age and U-concentration.
To readdress the questions raised in the U-series
section: the U-series results on the dentine seem
more likely to indicate the speciﬁc uranium uptake
history (as indicated in Fig. 4b) rather than age.
Some samples were shielded from percolating
waters by cementation, accumulated uranium only
at an early stage and have relatively old apparent
ages. Other samples, in looser matrix or where the
cement was re-dissolved, may have acquired

329

signiﬁcant amounts in a later stage of deposition,
showing young apparent U-series ages. For the
burial samples, it is documented that Skhul II was
in the least cemented sediment, followed by Skhul V,
and IX being in the hardest sediment of the site. The
U-concentrations and apparent ages follow the
same pattern. Skhul II was most exposed to
percolating water and hence accumulated the most
uranium over the longest time, followed by Skhul V.
The burial of Skhul IX was cemented early on and
U-accumulation stopped. This is supported by the
occurrence of patination on the stone tools. The
ﬂints in layer B1 are patinated, indicating hydration
(Z exposure to water) over signiﬁcant time spans,
whereas the older ﬂints in the highly cemented layer
B2 are unpatinated, i.e. they were signiﬁcantly less
exposed to water. Figure 8b shows the plot of
U-concentrations versus p-value, which is a measure
for the U-uptake history. A p-value of 1 equates
to a closed system (EU), p Z 0 to linear U-uptake
and positive p-values to further delayed U-uptake.
There is some trend between U-concentration and
p-value (as predicted in Fig. 4b), but there are also
exceptions, such as samples 522 and 856. Most
samples fall within error into the EU-LU bracket,
but Skhul II is clearly outside this range. This is
another example that the parametric EU-LU
models have only limited validity.
The age range of the site
Sample 851 indicates that deposition of the
layers at Skhul could have continued to about
45 ka. On the other hand, this sample could
perhaps derive from layer A. Samples 854 and
856 could represent a relatively short time period
around 69 ka, whereas samples 521, 522 1058 and
Skhul II fall within the range of 95 to 120 ka.
Sample 1047 could be somewhat older. Unfortunately, the large errors introduced by the uncertainty in the gamma dosimetry preclude an
analysis of whether the site accumulated over
a longer time period or whether it presents
a reasonably short time period. A c2 test indicated
that the US-ESR data may well belong to the
same population whether including sample
1057 (c2 Z 1.86), 1057* (c2 Z 2.11) or neither
(c2 Z 1.12). As such, the best estimate for the site

the samples with higher U-concentration experienced more delayed U-uptake (compare Fig. 4B).

is given by the average and the standard deviation
of the US-ESR results of 102G26 ka.
The burial samples
The U-series results of the bone of Skhul IX
and the bovid tooth 1057 are very similar,
indicating that they were deposited within a relatively short time range. There is no doubt,
however, that the two samples are quite diﬀerent
to the other samples from the site. The closed
system TIMS U-series results on both the bone of
Skhul IX, as well as the bovid tooth, are
signiﬁcantly older than the other material. For
the Skhul IX samples, it is found that the burial
should be older than 90 ka (gamma spectrometry)
and may be close to 131 ka (bone surface sample).
The U-series results indicate that the bovid tooth is
older than 108 ka and, from the EU-ESR results,
that it is older than 120 ka. The US-ESR have such
large uncertainties (which is partly caused by the
problem of unknown distance between the bedrock and the deposited sample), that they do not
further constrain the age assessment.
Although the ESR age assessments of Skhul II
are associated with very large errors, the ESR

results indicate that the Skhul II is signiﬁcantly
older (O66 ka) than the apparent U-series age
estimate on the dentine (w 32 ka). The best age
estimate is given by the US-ESR result of 116C43
24 ka.
The pig tooth 1058 associated with the Skhul V
burial also has a very young U-series age estimate
(w 40 ka). Again ESR implies a much older age
(O70 ka), the best age estimate being 93C21
12 ka.
If it is assumed that the three burials took place
over a relatively short time period, then the 2-s
age ranges of the burial samples would place it in
the range of 100 to 135 ka. Note that the US-ESR
results are highly asymmetrical and it is not
possible to calculate any age estimates if the EU
ESR age is older than the closed system U-series
result. As a consequence, the lower age range for
the burials is constrained by the U-series results of
1057. If the burial of Skhul IX was older than II
and V, the best age estimate for the burials of
Skhul II and V is 98C19
10 ka (weighted mean of the
two average US-ESR results).
Sensitivity test for the US-ESR results
As pointed out above, the US-ESR results are
critically dependent on the reconstruction of the

R. Grün et al. / Journal of Human Evolution 49 (2005) 316e334

331

their mean values, the external gamma dose rate is
varied in 1 -standard deviation steps (see Table 4).
There are two limiting factors: the external dose
rate cannot be negative and the age cannot be
smaller than the closed system U-series result.
Figure 9 allows two observations: (I) the Skhul II
results could possibly overlap with the MP/UP
transition, the gamma dose rates having been
underestimated by more than 3 standard deviations, and no other samples falling into this time
range; and (ii) samples 854 and 856 are most likely
younger than the burial samples.
Comparison with TL results

environmental dose rate. What if it is completely
wrong? The sensitivity of the US-ESR age
estimates on the external gamma dose rate is
shown in Fig. 9. Leaving all other parameters at

The thermoluminescence results of Mercier et al.
(1993) show somewhat less scattering than the USESR results (Fig. 10a). Due to the even distribution
of bones and ﬂints throughout the site one would
generally expect a similar scatter in both data sets.
However, all ﬂints used for TL dating were
unpatinated (Mercier, pers. comm), and are therefore derived from the lower, more cemented layer B2.
The plot of the TL De values vs the internal dose

ranges discussed in Fig. 4A, are included for cross reference. B: Plot of De versus the internal dose rate. This plot either implies that the
external dose rate for the diﬀerent samples were diﬀerent or that the samples have diﬀerent ages (or a combination of both). The age of
the apparently older sample ES5 coincides with the age estimates on the samples relating to the Skhul IX burial.

332

rates (Fig. 10b) does not result in an isochron from
which it would be possible to derive an external
dose rate value (Aitken and Valladas, 1992). This
may imply either that the external dose rate varied
from sample to sample or that the samples are of
diﬀerent ages. Five of the six samples agree very
well with the range derived from the three burial
samples of 100 to 130 ka; one sample (ES5) seems
older, falling into the same age range as the Skhul
IX samples. Notably, within error, none of the TL
results is younger than 80 ka.
Summary of the dating results
At this stage it is not possible to decide whether
the burial samples are of the same age population
or whether Skhul IX is older than II and V. If the
burials took place within a short time span, then the
best age estimate lies between 100 and 130 ka. If
Skhul IX was older than II and V, perhaps around
140 ka, which could be argued given its lower
stratigraphic and archaic morphology (Stringer,
1996) then the best estimate for II and V is
98C19
10 ka. The young apparent U-series results are
more likely a result of delayed U-uptake than real
age. The age results on the burials are in excellent
agreement with the thermoluminescence results of
Mercier et al. (1993). It is not possible for the ages of
any of the burial samples, except Skhul II, to be of late
Middle Palaeolithic/early Upper Palaeolithic age.
Implications
Because of the relatively large errors involved in
the age estimations, it is diﬃcult to establish the
chronological position of the Skhul burials relative
to those from the early modern human site of
Qafzeh, as well as the nearby Neanderthal site of
Tabun. Qafzeh was dated by TL analysis of burnt
ﬂint (Valladas et al., 1988), giving an age of
92G5 ka, while ESR analyses of teeth (Schwarcz
et al., 1988; Grün and Stringer, 1991) yielded EU
and LU age estimates of 100G10 ka and
120G8 ka, respectively. A gamma spectrometric
analysis of Qafzeh yielded results of about 8094 ka (Yokoyama et al., 1997). An ESRAJ-series
study of dental material from Tabun C1 led to the
conclusion that the specimen had an age of

122G16 ka and was most likely buried from Layer
B into Layer C (Grün and Stringer, 2000), thus
supporting the re-analysis of the original ﬁeld
notes (Bar-Yosef and Callander, 1999).
All these age estimates suggest that the three
burial sites, Skhul, Qafzeh and Tabun are broadly
contemporaneous, falling within the time range of
100 to 130 ka. Unfortunately, the present resolution of dating methods does not allow a more
precise establishment of their relative chronological
position. The presence of early representatives of
both early modern humans and Neanderthals in
the Levant during Oxygen Isotope Stage 5 inevitably
complicates attempts at segregating these populations by date or archaeological association. Nevertheless, it does appear that the oldest known
symbolic burials are those of early modern humans
at Skhul and Qafzeh. This supports the view that,
despite the associated Middle Palaeolithic technology, elements of modern human behaviour,
expressed through symbolic burials, were present
in the Levant prior to 100 ka.
